The presiding deity of that planet, who is the son of Si\u1e41hik\u0101, is the most abominable of all asuras, but although he is completely unfit to assume the position of a demigod or planetary deity, he has achieved that position by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Later I shall speak further about him."

Formerly, when nectar was being distributed, R\u0101hu tried to create dissension between the sun and moon by interposing himself between them. R\u0101hu is inimical toward both the sun and the moon, and therefore he always tries to cover the sunshine and moonshine on the dark-moon day and full-moon night."

In Atala there is a demon, the son of Maya D\u0101nava named Bala, who created ninety-six kinds of mystic power. Some so-called yog\u012bs and sv\u0101m\u012bs take advantage of this mystic power to cheat people even today. Simply by yawning, the demon Bala created three kinds of women, known as svairi\u1e47\u012b, k\u0101mi\u1e47\u012b and pu\u1e41\u015bcal\u012b. The svairi\u1e47\u012bs like to marry men from their own group, the k\u0101mi\u1e47\u012bs marry men from any group, and the pu\u1e41\u015bcal\u012bs change husbands one after another. If a man enters the planet of Atala, these women immediately capture him and induce him to drink an intoxicating beverage made with a drug known as h\u0101\u1e6daka [cannabis indica]. This intoxicant endows the man with great sexual prowess, of which the women take advantage for enjoyment. A woman will enchant him with attractive glances, intimate words, smiles of love and then embraces. In this way she induces him to enjoy sex with her to her full satisfaction. Because of his increased sexual power, the man thinks himself stronger than ten thousand elephants and considers himself most perfect. Indeed, illusioned and intoxicated by false pride, he thinks himself God, ignoring impending death."

When fire, being made to blaze by the wind, drinks of this river and then sizzles and spits it out, it produces gold called H\u0101\u1e6daka.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the source of life for all living entities, lives within everyone as the friendly Supersoul, and under His direction a living entity enjoys or suffers in the material world. Greatly appreciating the transcendental qualities of the Lord, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja offered everything at His lotus feet. His purpose, however, was not to gain anything material, but to become a pure devotee. For a pure devotee, the door of liberation is automatically opened. One should not think that Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was given so much material opulence merely because of his charity. When one becomes a pure devotee in love, he may also be blessed with a good material position by the will of the Supreme Lord. However, one should not mistakenly think that the material opulence of a devotee is the result of his devotional service. The real result of devotional service is the awakening of pure love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which continues under all circumstances."
