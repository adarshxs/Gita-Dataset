Then He extended His left foot to the end of the universe and pierced a hole in its covering with the nail of His big toe. Through the hole, the pure water of the Causal Ocean entered this universe as the Ganges River. Having washed the lotus feet of the Lord, which are covered with reddish powder, the water of the Ganges acquired a very beautiful pink color. Every living being can immediately purify his mind of material contamination by touching the transcendental water of the Ganges, yet its waters remain ever pure. Because the Ganges directly touches the lotus feet of the Lord before descending within this universe, she is known as Vi\u1e63\u1e47upad\u012b. Later she received other names like J\u0101hnav\u012b and Bh\u0101g\u012brath\u012b. After one thousand millenniums, the water of the Ganges descended to Dhruvaloka, the topmost planet in this universe. Therefore all learned sages and scholars proclaim Dhruvaloka to be Vi\u1e63\u1e47upada [\u201csituated on Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s lotus feet\u201d]."

Knowing that the sacred Ganges water washes the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, situated on his own planet, to this very day accepts that water on his head with great devotion. Because he constantly thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very devoutly within the core of his heart, he is overcome with ecstatic anxiety. Tears flow from his half-open eyes, and eruptions appear on his entire body."

Well aware of the influence of the water of the Ganges, to this day they keep Ganges water on the tufts of hair on their heads. They have concluded that this is the ultimate wealth, the perfection of all austerities, and the best means of prosecuting transcendental life. Having obtained uninterrupted devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they neglect all other beneficial processes like religion, economic development, sense gratification and even merging into the Supreme. Just as j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs think that merging into the existence of the Lord is the highest truth, these seven exalted personalities accept devotional service as the perfection of life."

In this pleasing situation, the wives of the demigods smile playfully at their husbands and look upon them with lusty desires.
