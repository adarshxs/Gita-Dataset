There was a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who belonged to the dynasty of A\u1e45gir\u0101. He was fully qualified with brahminical qualifications. He could control his mind and senses, and he had studied the Vedic literatures and other subsidiary literatures. He was expert in giving charity, and he was always satisfied, tolerant, very gentle, learned and nonenvious. He was self-realized and engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He remained always in a trance. He had nine equally qualified sons by his first wife, and by his second wife he begot twins \u2014 a brother and a sister, of which the male child was said to be the topmost devotee and foremost of saintly kings \u2014 Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. This, then, is the story of the birth he took after giving up the body of a deer."

Although he received the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he was still very much afraid of his relatives and friends who were not devotees. He was always very cautious of such association because he feared that he would again fall down. Consequently he manifested himself before the public eye as a madman \u2014 dull, blind and deaf \u2014 so that others would not try to talk to him. In this way he saved himself from bad association. Within he was always thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord and chanting the Lord\u2019s glories, which save one from the bondage of fruitive action. In this way he saved himself from the onslaught of nondevotee associates."

Therefore he was always attached to Ja\u1e0da Bharata. Because Ja\u1e0da Bharata was unfit to enter the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama, he simply executed the purificatory process up to the end of the brahmacarya-\u0101\u015brama. Although Ja\u1e0da Bharata was unwilling to accept his father\u2019s instructions, the br\u0101hma\u1e47a nonetheless instructed him in how to keep clean and how to wash, thinking that the son should be taught by the father."

Although instructed to wash his hands after evacuating, he would wash them before. Nonetheless, his father wanted to give him Vedic instructions during the spring and summer. He tried to teach him the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra along with o\u1e41k\u0101ra and vy\u0101h\u1e5bti, but after four months his father still was not successful in instructing him."

He tried his best to teach his son in this way, but all his endeavors failed. In his heart he hoped that his son would be a learned scholar, but all his attempts were unsuccessful. Like everyone, this br\u0101hma\u1e47a was attached to his home, and he had forgotten that someday he would die. Death, however, was not forgetful.

These two-legged, animalistic men used to call Ja\u1e0da Bharata mad, dull, deaf and dumb. They mistreated him, and Ja\u1e0da Bharata behaved for them like a madman who was deaf, blind or dull. He did not protest or try to convince them that he was not so. If others wanted him to do something, he acted according to their desires. Whatever food he could acquire by begging or by wages, and whatever came of its own accord \u2014 be it a small quantity, palatable, stale or tasteless \u2014 he would accept and eat. He never ate anything for sense gratification because he was already liberated from the bodily conception, which induces one to accept palatable or unpalatable food. He was full in the transcendental consciousness of devotional service, and therefore he was unaffected by the dualities arising from the bodily conception. Actually his body was as strong as a bull\u2019s, and his limbs were very muscular. He didn\u2019t care for winter or summer, wind or rain, and he never covered his body at any time. He lay on the ground, and never smeared oil on his body or took a bath. Because his body was dirty, his spiritual effulgence and knowledge were covered, just as the splendor of a valuable gem is covered by dirt. He only wore a dirty loincloth and his sacred thread, which was blackish. Understanding that he was born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family, people would call him a brahma-bandhu and other names. Being thus insulted and neglected by materialistic people, he wandered here and there."

Due to their envy, these dacoits brought him before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b for sacrifice.

He was born of a good br\u0101hma\u1e47a father, and killing him was forbidden, even though he might have been an enemy or aggressive person. In any case, there was no reason to kill Ja\u1e0da Bharata, and the goddess K\u0101l\u012b could not bear this. She could immediately understand that these sinful dacoits were about to kill a great devotee of the Lord. Suddenly the deity\u2019s body burst asunder, and the goddess K\u0101l\u012b personally emerged from it in a body burning with an intense and intolerable effulgence."

She then began to drink the hot blood that flowed from the necks of the beheaded rogues and thieves, as if this blood were liquor. Indeed, she drank this intoxicant with her associates, who were witches and female demons. Becoming intoxicated with this blood, they all began to sing very loudly and dance as though prepared to annihilate the entire universe. At the same time, they began to play with the heads of the rogues and thieves, tossing them about as if they were balls."
