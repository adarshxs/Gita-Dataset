Thus, in the following manner, he should bind himself with the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a coat of armor. First, while chanting the mantra composed of eight syllables [o\u1e41 namo n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101ya], beginning with the pra\u1e47ava, the syllable om, one should touch his hands to eight parts of his body, starting with the two feet and progressing systematically to the knees, thighs, abdomen, heart, chest, mouth and head. Then one should chant the mantra in reverse, beginning from the last syllable [ya], while touching the parts of his body in the reverse order.
