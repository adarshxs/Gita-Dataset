His ears are beautiful, His cheeks brilliant, and His smiling attractive to everyone. Whoever sees Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sees a festival. His face and body are fully satisfying for everyone to see, but the devotees are angry at the creator for the disturbance caused by the momentary blinking of their eyes."

In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana the Lord killed many demons, and afterwards He returned to Dv\u0101rak\u0101, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life."

Simply by His glance, He annihilated all the demoniac kings on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra and declared victory for Arjuna. Finally, He instructed Uddhava about transcendental life and devotion and then returned to His abode in His original form."
