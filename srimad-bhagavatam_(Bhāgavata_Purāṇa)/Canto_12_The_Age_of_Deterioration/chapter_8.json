But this same M\u0101rka\u1e47\u1e0deya \u1e5a\u1e63i, the foremost descendant of Bh\u1e5bgu, took birth in my own family during the current day of Brahm\u0101, and we have not yet seen any total annihilation in this day of Brahm\u0101. Also, it is well known that M\u0101rka\u1e47\u1e0deya, while wandering helplessly in the great ocean of annihilation, saw in those fearful waters a wonderful personality \u2014 an infant boy lying alone within the fold of a banyan leaf. O S\u016bta, I am most bewildered and curious about this great sage, M\u0101rka\u1e47\u1e0deya \u1e5a\u1e63i. O great yog\u012b, you are universally accepted as the authority on all the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. Therefore kindly dispel my confusion."

He became advanced in austerity and Vedic knowledge and remained a lifelong celibate. Appearing most peaceful with his matted hair and his clothing made of bark, he furthered his spiritual progress by carrying the mendicant\u2019s waterpot, staff, sacred thread, brahmac\u0101r\u012b belt, black deerskin, lotus-seed prayer beads and bundles of ku\u015ba grass. At the sacred junctures of the day he regularly worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead in five forms \u2014 the sacrificial fire, the sun, his spiritual master, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the Supersoul within his heart. Morning and evening he would go out begging, and upon returning he would present all the food he had collected to his spiritual master. Only when his spiritual master invited him would he silently take his one meal of the day; otherwise he would fast. Thus devoted to austerity and Vedic study, M\u0101rka\u1e47\u1e0deya \u1e5a\u1e63i worshiped the supreme master of the senses, the Personality of Godhead, for countless millions of years, and in this way he conquered unconquerable death."
