Those who are advanced in transcendental consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, are never envious, neither of the soul nor of the activities of the soul under the influence of material nature.

Being a creation of nescience, the body has two types of activities. In the bodily conception, when we think that sense gratification will help us, we are in illusion. Another kind of illusion is to think that one will become happy by trying to satisfy the desires that arise from the illusory body or by attaining elevation to the higher planetary systems or by performing various types of Vedic rituals. This is all illusion. Similarly, material activities performed for political emancipation and social and humanitarian activities performed with an idea that people of the world will be happy are also illusory because the basic principle is the bodily conception, which is illusory. Whatever we desire or perform under the bodily conception is all illusion. In other words, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u informed P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that although the sacrificial performances set an example for ordinary people, there was no need for such sacrificial performances as far as his personal self was concerned.

Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.\u201d The ritualistic performances recommended in the Vedas mainly depend on the three modes of material nature. Consequently Arjuna was advised to transcend the Vedic activities. The activities Arjuna was advised to perform were the transcendental activities of devotional service."

He is without material covering, and He is the witness of all activities. He is completely distinguished from other living entities, and He is transcendental to all embodied souls.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse two significant words are used: asa\u1e41sakta\u1e25, meaning \u201cwithout attachment,\u201d and budha\u1e25, meaning \u201cfully cognizant of everything.\u201d By full cognizance it is meant that one should know about his own constitutional position as well as the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to \u015ar\u012b Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, in this verse Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is describing Himself, or the Param\u0101tm\u0101. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 is always distinguished from the embodied soul as well as the material world. Therefore He has been described as para. That para, or Supreme Personality of Godhead, is eka, meaning \u201cone.\u201d The Lord is one, whereas the conditioned souls embodied within the material world exist in many varieties of form. There are demigods, human beings, animals, trees, birds, bees and so forth. Thus the living entities are not eka but many. As confirmed in the Vedas: nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m. The living entities, who are many and who are entangled in this material world, are not pure. However, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pure and detached. Due to being covered by the material body, the living entities are not self-effulgent, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param\u0101tm\u0101, is self-effulgent. The living entities, being contaminated by the modes of material nature, are called sagu\u1e47a, whereas Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is nirgu\u1e47a, not being under the influence of the material modes. The living entities, being encaged in material qualities, are gu\u1e47\u0101\u015brita, whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead is gu\u1e47\u0101\u015braya. The conditioned soul\u2019s vision is covered by material contamination; therefore he cannot see the cause of his actions, and he cannot see his past lives. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, not being covered by a material body, is the witness of all the activities of the living entity. But both of them, the living entity and the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are \u0101tm\u0101, or spirit. They are one in quality, yet they are different in so many ways, especially in regard to the six opulences the Supreme Personality of Godhead has in full. Full knowledge means that the j\u012bva-\u0101tm\u0101, the living entity, must know both his position and the Supreme\u2019s position. That is full knowledge."

        "purport": " This verse is also confirmed by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a. Occupational duties are known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma and apply to the four divisions of material and spiritual life \u2014 namely br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra, and brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. If one works according to the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma system and does not desire fruitive results, he gets satisfaction gradually. Discharging one\u2019s occupational duty as a means of rendering devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms this as the process of karma-yoga. In other words, we should act only for the satisfaction and service of the Lord; otherwise we will be entangled by the resultant actions. Everyone is situated in his occupational duty, but the purpose of material occupations should not be material gain. Rather, everyone should offer the results of his occupational activities. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a especially should execute his occupational duties not for material gain but to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra should work in a similar way. In this material world everyone is engaged in various professional and occupational duties, but the purpose of such activities should be to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devotional service is very simple, and anyone can adopt it. Let one remain what he is; he need only install the Deity of the Supreme Lord in his house. The Deity may be R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (there are many other forms of the Lord). In this way a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra can worship the Deity with the results of his honest labor. Regardless of one\u2019s occupational duty, one should adopt the devotional means of hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, offering everything to the Lord and engaging in His service. In this way one can very easily engage himself in the service of the Lord. When the Lord is pleased with one\u2019s service, one\u2019s mission in life is fulfilled."

        "purport": " This verse describes how one can become liberated from material bondage. The first point is that one must know that the soul is different from his body. The soul is called deh\u012b, or one who possesses the body, and the material body is called deha, or the embodiment of the soul. The body is changing at every moment, but the soul is fixed; therefore the soul is called k\u016b\u1e6da-stham. The change of body is enacted by the reactions of the three modes of nature. One who has understood the fixed position of the soul should not be disturbed by the incoming and outgoing interactions of the modes of material nature in the form of happiness and distress. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends that since happiness and distress come and go due to the interaction of the modes of nature on the body, one should not be disturbed by such external movements. Even though one is sometimes absorbed in such external movements, he has to learn to tolerate them. The living entity should be always indifferent to the action and reaction of the external body. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the body, made of the gross physical elements (earth, water, fire, air and sky) and the subtle elements (mind, intelligence and ego), is completely different from the soul proper. One should therefore not be disturbed by the action and reaction of these eight gross and subtle material elements. The practical process to attain this stage of indifference is to execute devotional service. Only one who constantly engages in devotional service twenty-four hours a day can be indifferent to the action and reaction of the external body. When a man is absorbed in a particular thought, he does not hear or see any external activities, even though they are enacted in his presence. Similarly, those who are fully absorbed in devotional service do not care what is going on with the external body. That status is called sam\u0101dhi. One who is actually situated in sam\u0101dhi is understood to be a first-class yog\u012b."

        "translation": "Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u told King P\u1e5bthu: My dear King, the constant change of this material world is due to the interaction of the three modes of material nature. The five elements, the senses, the demigods who control the senses, as well as the mind, which is agitated by the spirit soul \u2014 all these taken together comprise the body. Since the spirit soul is completely different from this combination of gross and subtle material elements, My devotee who is connected with Me in intense friendship and affection, being completely in knowledge, is never agitated by material happiness and distress.",
        "purport": " The question may be raised that if the living entity has to act as the superintendent of the activities of the bodily combination, then how can he be indifferent to the activities of the body? The answer is given here: these activities are completely different from the activities of the spirit soul of the living entity. A crude example can be given in this connection: A businessman riding in a motorcar sits in the car, supervises its running and advises the driver. He knows how much gasoline is used up, and he knows everything about the car, but still he is apart from the car and is more concerned with his business. Even while riding in the car, he thinks of his business and his office. He has no connection with the car, although he is sitting there. As the businessman is always absorbed in thoughts of his business, so the living entity can be absorbed in thoughts of rendering loving service to the Lord. Then it will be possible to remain separate from the activities of the material body. This position of neutrality can be possible only for a devotee. The word baddha-sauh\u1e5bd\u0101\u1e25, \u201cbound in friendship,\u201d is particularly used here. Karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs cannot be bound in devotional service. Karm\u012bs fully engage in the activities of the body. Their aim of life is to give comfort to the body only. J\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs try to get out of entanglement by philosophical speculation, but they have no standing in the liberated position. Because they do not take shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord, they fall down from the exalted position of Brahman realization. Yog\u012bs also have a bodily concept of life \u2014 they think that they can achieve something spiritual by exercising the body through dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, etc. A devotee\u2019s position is always transcendental because of his intimate relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, to remain always aloof from the actions and reactions of the body and engage in one\u2019s real occupation, namely rendering service to the Lord, can be possible only for devotees."

        "purport": " Here is an example of receiving direct instruction from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. One has to execute the order of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, whether receiving it directly from Him or from His bona fide representative, the spiritual master. Arjuna fought the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra under the direct order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, here P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is also being given orders by Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u regarding the execution of his duty. We have to stick to the principles stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101 buddhi\u1e25: every man\u2019s duty is to receive orders from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or from His bona fide representative and take these orders as his life and soul, without personal considerations. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura states that one should not care very much whether he is going to be liberated or not, but he should simply execute the direct order received from the spiritual master. If one sticks to the principle of abiding by the order of the spiritual master, he will always remain in a liberated position. A common man must execute the rules and regulations of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma by working in his prescribed duty according to the caste system (br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra) and the spiritual-order system (brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa). If one simply executes regularly and strictly the injunctions given for the different divisions of life, then one satisfies Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. As a king, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was ordered by Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to keep himself always aloof from the activities of the bodily situation and to engage always in the service of the Lord and thus keep himself in the liberated stage. The word baddha-sauh\u1e5bd\u0101\u1e25 in the previous verse is explained herewith. One can fully remain in intimate connection with the Supreme Lord directly or receive orders from His bona fide representative the spiritual master and execute the orders sincerely when one keeps aloof from the activities of the body. The Lord helps us by giving us directions how to act in devotional service and thus advance on the path back home, back to Godhead. He instructs us outwardly in the form of the spiritual master. Therefore, one should not accept the spiritual master as an ordinary human being. The Lord says, \u0101c\u0101rya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 vij\u0101n\u012by\u0101n n\u0101va-manyeta karhicit: one should not treat the spiritual master as an ordinary human being, for he is the substitute for the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Bh\u0101g. 11.17.27). One should treat the spiritual master as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and never be envious of him or consider him to be an ordinary human being. If we follow the instruction of the spiritual master and execute devotional service to the Lord, we will remain always free from the contamination of bodily and material activities, and our life will be successful."

        "purport": " The question may be raised here that if everyone engaged in spiritual activities to attain salvation and became indifferent to the activities of the material world, then how could things as they are go on? And if things are to go on as they ought to, how can a head of state be indifferent to such activities? In answer to this question, the word \u015breya\u1e25, \u201causpicious,\u201d is used here. The division of activities in society as arranged by the Supreme Personality of Godhead was not blindly or accidentally created, as foolish people say. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a must do his duty properly, and the k\u1e63atriya, the vai\u015bya and even the \u015b\u016bdra must do the same. And every one of them can achieve the highest perfection of life \u2014 liberation from this material bondage. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.45). Sve sve karma\u1e47y abhirata\u1e25 sa\u1e41siddhi\u1e41 labhate nara\u1e25: \u201cBy executing one\u2019s prescribed duties, one can attain the highest perfection.\u201d Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u advised Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu that a king is not enjoined to give up his kingdom and the responsibility of protecting the praj\u0101s, or citizens, to instead go away to the Him\u0101layas for liberation. He can attain liberation while executing his royal duties. The royal duty or the duty of the head of state is to see that the praj\u0101s, or the general mass of people, are doing their respective duties for spiritual salvation. A secular state does not necessitate a king or head of state who is indifferent to the activities of the praj\u0101s. In the modern state the government has many rules and regulations for conducting the duties of the praj\u0101s, but the government neglects to see that the citizens advance in spiritual knowledge. If the government is careless in this matter, the citizens will act whimsically, without any sense of God realization or spiritual life, and thus become entangled in sinful activities. An executive head should not be callous to the welfare of the general mass of people while he simply goes on collecting taxes. The king\u2019s real duty is to see that the citizens gradually become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious means completely free from all sinful activities. As soon as there is complete eradication of sinful activities in the state, then there will be no more war, pestilence, famine or natural disturbances. This was actually prevailing during the reign of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. If a king or head of the government is able to induce the citizens to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, then he is worthy to rule over the mass of people; otherwise, he has no right to levy taxes. If the king looks after the spiritual interests of the citizens, he can levy taxes without difficulties. In this way both the subjects and the king will be happy during this life, and in the next life the king will be able to share one sixth of the pious activities of the citizens. Otherwise, by levying taxes on the sinful citizens, he will have to share the reactions of their sinful activities. This same principle can be applied to parents and spiritual masters as well. If parents simply give birth to children like cats and dogs but cannot save their children from imminent death, they become responsible for the activities of their animalistic children. Lately, such children are turning into hippies. Similarly, if a spiritual master cannot direct his disciples to become free of sinful activities, he becomes responsible for their sinful acts. These subtle laws of nature are unknown to the present leaders of society. Since the leaders of society have a poor fund of knowledge and the citizens in general are rogues and thieves, there cannot be an auspicious situation for human society. At the present moment the whole world is full of such an incompatible combination of state and citizens, and therefore there is constant tension, war and anxiety as an inevitable result of such social conditions."

In this age, however, since the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma is topsy-turvy, it is very difficult to strictly follow all the principles. The only method for becoming perfect in life is to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma is executed from different positions by different men, so the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness principles can be followed by everyone in every part of the world. There is a specific purpose in mentioning herein that one should follow the dvij\u0101gryas, the most prominent br\u0101hma\u1e47as, like Par\u0101\u015bara and Manu. These great sages have already given us instructions on how to live according to the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. Similarly, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b and R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b have given us rules and regulations for becoming pure devotees of the Lord. It is essential, therefore, to follow the instructions of the \u0101c\u0101ryas in the parampar\u0101 system, who have received the knowledge as passed down from spiritual master to disciple. In this way, although living in our material condition of life, we can get out of the entanglement of material contamination without leaving our positions. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu advises, therefore, that one does not have to change his position. One simply has to hear from the perfect source (this is called parampar\u0101) and follow the principles for practical application in life; thus one can attain the highest perfection of life \u2014 liberation \u2014 and go back home, back to Godhead. In other words, the change required is a change in consciousness, not in the body. Unfortunately, in this fallen age, people are concerned with the body, not with the soul. They have invented so many \u201cisms\u201d pertaining to the body only, not to the soul. In the modern age of democracy there are so many government representatives voting for legislation. Every day they bring out a new law. But because these laws are only mental concoctions manufactured by inexperienced conditioned souls, they cannot give relief to human society. Formerly, although the kings were autocrats, they strictly followed the principles laid down by great sages and saintly persons. There were no mistakes in ruling over the country, and everything went perfectly. The citizens were completely pious, the king levied taxes legitimately, and therefore the situation was very happy. At the present moment the so-called executive heads are more or less selected from materially ambitious persons who simply look after their own personal interests; they have no knowledge of the \u015b\u0101stras. In other words, the executive heads are fools and rascals in the strict sense of the terms, and the people in general are \u015b\u016bdras. This combination of fools and rascals and \u015b\u016bdras cannot bring about peace and prosperity in this world. Therefore we find periodic upheavals in society in the forms of battles, communal riots and fratricidal quarrels. Under these circumstances, not only are the leaders unable to lead the people toward liberation, but they cannot even give them peace of mind. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated that anyone who lives on concocted ideas, without reference to the \u015b\u0101stras, never becomes successful and does not attain happiness or liberation after death."

But I always remain equipoised in the heart of one who is also equipoised in all circumstances.",
        "purport": " Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u was very pleased with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu\u2019s good character and behavior and offered him a benediction. The Lord openly says that performing great sacrifices or undergoing the austerities of mystic yoga practice cannot satisfy Him. He is pleased only by elevated character and behavior. But these cannot develop unless one becomes a pure devotee of the Lord. Anyone who has developed unalloyed, unflinching devotional service unto the Lord develops his original good qualities as spirit soul. The spirit soul, as part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has all the good qualities of the Lord. When the spirit soul is contaminated by the material modes of nature, one is considered good or bad with reference to the material qualities. But when one is transcendental to all material qualities, all the good qualities come out. These qualities of a devotee, twenty-six in number, are listed as follows: (1) kind to everyone, (2) does not quarrel with anyone, (3) fixed in the Absolute Truth, (4) equal to everyone, (5) faultless, (6) charitable, (7) mild, (8) clean, (9) simple, (10) benevolent, (11) peaceful, (12) completely attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, (13) has no material hankering, (14) meek, (15) steady, (16) self-controlled, (17) does not eat more than required, (18) sane, (19) respectful, (20) humble, (21) grave, (22) compassionate, (23) friendly, (24) poetic, (25) expert, (26) silent. The Lord is satisfied by development of the transcendental qualities of the living entity and not by artificial performance of sacrifices and mystic yoga. In other words, unless one is fully qualified to become a pure devotee of the Lord, one cannot expect to be liberated from material entanglement."

An offender at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is never excused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many instances illustrating this fact. Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was offended by Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, a great sage and mystic yog\u012b, and Durv\u0101s\u0101 also had to fall down at the lotus feet of Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Indra decided to fall down at the lotus feet of King P\u1e5bthu, but the King was so magnanimous a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava that he did not want Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Indra to fall down at his feet. Instead, King P\u1e5bthu immediately picked him up and embraced him, and both of them forgot all the past incidents. Both King Indra and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu were envious and angry with each other, but since both of them were Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, or servants of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it was their duty to adjust the cause of their envy. This is also a first-class example of cooperative behavior between Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. In the present days, however, because people are not Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, they fight perpetually among one another and are vanquished without finishing the mission of human life. There is a great need to propagate the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement in the world so that even though people sometimes become angry and malicious toward one another, because of their being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious such rivalry, competition and envy can be adjusted without difficulty."

In another place, the Lord says that a devotee always exists in His heart and He also exists always in the heart of the devotee. The special inclination of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for His pure devotee is not unnatural, nor is it partiality. For example, sometimes a father has several children, but he has special affection for one child who is very much inclined toward him. This is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): Those who constantly engage in the devotional service of the Lord in love and affection are directly in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead sitting as the Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart. The Lord is not far away from the devotee. He is always in everyone\u2019s heart, but only the devotee can realize the Lord\u2019s presence, and thus he is directly connected and he takes instruction from the Lord at every moment. Therefore there is no chance of a devotee\u2019s being in error, nor is there any partiality on the part of the Lord for His pure devotees."

He simply embraced the Lord within his heart and remained standing in that way with folded hands.",
        "purport": " Just as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is addressed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as \u0101di-puru\u1e63a, the original personality, so King P\u1e5bthu, being an empowered incarnation of the Lord, is referred to in this verse as \u0101di-r\u0101ja\u1e25, the original or ideal king. He was a great devotee and at the same time a great hero who conquered over all undesirable elements in his kingdom. He was so powerful that he was equal in fighting to Indra, the King of heaven. He gave protection to his citizens, keeping them engaged in pious activities and devotion to the Lord. He did not collect a single cent of taxes from the citizens without being able to give them protection from all calamities. The greatest calamity in life is to become godless and therefore sinful. If the state head or king allows the citizens to become sinful by indulging in illicit sex life, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling, then the king is responsible, and he has to suffer the resultant sequence of reactions for the sinful lives of the citizens because he levies taxes on them unnecessarily. These are the principles for a ruling power, and because Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu observed all the principles for a ruling chief, he is referred to here as \u0101di-r\u0101ja\u1e25. Even a responsible king like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu can become a pure devotee of the first order. We can distinctly see from King P\u1e5bthu\u2019s behavior how he became ecstatic, both externally and internally, in pure devotional service. Just today we have seen in the newspapers of Bombay that the government is going to repeal its prohibition laws. Ever since Gandhi\u2019s noncooperation movement, Bombay has been kept dry and has not allowed its citizens to drink. But unfortunately the citizens are so clever that they have increased illicit distillation of liquor, and although not being sold publicly in shops, liquor is being sold in public lavatories and similar abnormal places. Unable to check such illicit smuggling, the government has decided to manufacture the liquor at cheaper prices so that people can have their supply of intoxication directly from the government instead of purchasing it in public lavatories. The government failed to change the hearts of the citizens from indulging in sinful life, so instead of losing the taxes they collect to inflate the treasury, they have decided to manufacture liquor to supply to the citizens who hanker after it. This kind of government cannot check the resultant actions of sinful life, namely war, pestilence, famine, earthquakes and similar other disturbances. Nature\u2019s law is that as soon as there are discrepancies in regard to the law of God (which are described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as dharmasya gl\u0101ni\u1e25, or disobedience to the laws of nature or God), at once there will be heavy punishment in the form of sudden outbreaks of war. We have recently experienced a war between India and Pakistan. Within fourteen days there have been immense losses of men and money, and there have been disturbances to the entire world. These are the reactions of sinful life. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is meant to make people pure and perfect. If we become even partially pure, as described in the Bh\u0101gavatam (na\u1e63\u1e6da-pr\u0101ye\u1e63v abhadre\u1e63u), by development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then lust and greed, the material diseases of the citizens, will be reduced. This can be made possible simply by broadcasting the pure message of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Big commercial and industrial firms have contributed many thousands of rupees to a defense fund that burns the money in the form of gunpowder, but unfortunately, if they are asked to contribute liberally to advance the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, they are reluctant. Under the circumstances, the world will periodically suffer from such upsurges and outbreaks of war, which are the consequences of not being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious."

        "purport": " The significant point in this verse is that the Lord was standing above the ground, almost touching it. The residents of the upper planetary systems, beginning from Brahmaloka (the planet where Lord Brahm\u0101 lives) down to Svargaloka (the heavenly planet of Indra), are so advanced in spiritual life that when they come to visit this or similar other lower planetary systems, they keep their weightlessness. This means that they can stand without touching the ground. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because He lives in one of the planetary systems within this universe, He sometimes plays as if one of the demigods of this universe. When He first appeared before P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, He was not touching the ground of this earth, but when He was fully satisfied with the behavior and character of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, He immediately acted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Out of affection for P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, He touched the earth, but He rested the front of His hand on the raised shoulder of Garu\u1e0da, His carrier, as if to prevent Himself from falling down, since the Lord is not accustomed to stand on earthly ground. These are all symptoms of His great affection for P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Perceiving his fortunate position, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja could not fully look upon the Lord due to ecstasy, but still, in a faltering voice, he began to offer prayers."

        "purport": " There are different kinds of benedictions according to a person\u2019s demands. For karm\u012bs the best benediction is promotion to the higher planetary systems, where the duration of life is very long and the standard of living and happiness is very high. There are others, namely j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs, who want the benediction of merging into the existence of the Lord. This is called kaivalya. The Lord is therefore addressed as kaivalya-pati, the master or Lord of the benediction known as kaivalya. But devotees receive a different type of benediction from the Lord. Devotees are anxious neither for the heavenly planets nor for merging into the existence of the Lord. According to devotees, kaivalya, or merging into the existence of the Lord, is considered as good as hell. The word naraka means \u201chell.\u201d Similarly, everyone who exists in this material world is called n\u0101raka because this material existence itself is known as a hellish condition of life. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, expressed that he was interested neither in the benediction desired by the karm\u012bs nor that desired by the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs. \u015ar\u012bla Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b Prabhu, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, described that kaivalya is no better than a hellish condition of life, and as for the delights of the heavenly planets, they are factually will-o\u2019-the-wisps, or phantasmagoria. They are not wanted by devotees. Devotees do not even care for the positions held by Lord Brahm\u0101 or Lord \u015aiva, nor does a devotee desire to become equal with Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. As a pure devotee of the Lord, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja made his position very clear."

I want the benediction of at least one million ears, for thus I may be able to hear about the glories of Your lotus feet from the mouths of Your pure devotees.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu addressed the Lord as kaivalya-pati, the master of the liberation of merging into His existence. This does not mean that he was anxious for kaivalya liberation. That is made clear in this verse: \u201cMy dear Lord, I do not want such a benediction.\u201d Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu wanted to have a million ears to hear the glories of the lotus feet of the Lord. He specifically mentioned that the glories of the Lord should emanate from the mouths of pure devotees, who speak from the cores of their hearts. It is stated in the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.1.3), \u015buka-mukh\u0101d am\u1e5bta-drava-sa\u1e41yutam: the nectar of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam became more relishable because it emanated from the mouth of \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. One might think that these glories of the Lord can be heard from anywhere, from the mouths of either devotees or nondevotees, but here it is specifically mentioned that the glories of the Lord must emanate from the mouths of pure devotees. \u015ar\u012b San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b has strictly prohibited hearing from the mouth of a nondevotee. There are many professional reciters of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam who speak the narrations very ornamentally, but a pure devotee does not like to hear from them because such glorification of the Lord is simply a vibration of material sound. But when heard from the mouth of a pure devotee, glorification of the Lord is immediately effective. The words sat\u0101\u1e41 prasa\u1e45g\u0101n mama v\u012brya-sa\u1e41vida\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 3.25.25) mean that glorification of the Lord is potent when uttered from the mouth of a pure devotee. The Lord has innumerable devotees all over the universe, and they have been glorifying the Lord since time immemorial and for an unlimited time. But still they cannot completely finish enumerating the glories of the Lord. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore wanted innumerable ears, as R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b also desired to have millions of ears and millions of tongues to chant and hear the glorification of the Lord. In other words, if our ears are always engaged in hearing the glorification of the Lord, there will be no scope for hearing the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy, which is doom to spiritual progress. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said that if anyone hears from a M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosopher preaching about the activities of the Lord, even if it is a description from the Vedic literature, he is ultimately doomed. By hearing such M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy one cannot come to the destination of spiritual perfection of life."

When the transcendental vibration from the mouths of great devotees carries the aroma of the saffron dust of Your lotus feet, the forgetful living entity gradually remembers his eternal relationship with You. Devotees thus gradually come to the right conclusion about the value of life. My dear Lord, I therefore do not need any other benediction but the opportunity to hear from the mouth of Your pure devotee.",
        "purport": " It is explained in the previous verse that one has to hear glorification of the Lord from the mouth of a pure devotee. This is further explained here. The transcendental vibration from the mouth of a pure devotee is so powerful that it can revive the living entity\u2019s memory of his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In our material existence, under the influence of illusory m\u0101y\u0101, we have almost forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord, exactly like a man sleeping very deeply who forgets his duties. In the Vedas it is said that every one of us is sleeping under the influence of m\u0101y\u0101. We must get up from this slumber and engage in the right service, for thus we can properly utilize the facility of this human form of life. As expressed in a song by \u1e6ch\u0101kura Bhaktivinoda, Lord Caitanya says, j\u012bva j\u0101go, j\u012bva j\u0101go. The Lord asks every sleeping living entity to get up and engage in devotional service so that his mission in this human form of life may be fulfilled. This awakening voice comes through the mouth of a pure devotee. A pure devotee always engages in the service of the Lord, taking shelter of His lotus feet, and therefore he has a direct connection with the saffron mercy-particles that are strewn over the lotus feet of the Lord. Although when a pure devotee speaks the articulation of his voice may resemble the sound of this material sky, the voice is spiritually very powerful because it touches the particles of saffron dust on the lotus feet of the Lord. As soon as a sleeping living entity hears the powerful voice emanating from the mouth of a pure devotee, he immediately remembers his eternal relationship with the Lord, although up until that moment he had forgotten everything. For a conditioned soul, therefore, it is very important to hear from the mouth of a pure devotee, who is fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord without any material desire, speculative knowledge or contamination of the modes of material nature. Every one of us is kuyog\u012b because we have engaged in the service of this material world, forgetting our eternal relationship with the Lord as His eternal loving servants. It is our duty to rise from the kuyoga platform to become suyog\u012bs, perfect mystics. The process of hearing from a pure devotee is recommended in all Vedic scriptures, especially by Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. One may stay in his position of life \u2014 it does not matter what it is \u2014 but if one hears from the mouth of a pure devotee, he gradually comes to the understanding of his relationship with the Lord and thus engages in His loving service, and his life becomes completely perfect. Therefore, this process of hearing from the mouth of a pure devotee is very important for making progress in the line of spiritual understanding."

        "translation": "My dear highly glorified Lord, if one, in the association of pure devotees, hears even once the glories of Your activities, he does not, unless he is nothing but an animal, give up the association of devotees, for no intelligent person would be so careless as to leave their association. The perfection of chanting and hearing about Your glories was accepted even by the goddess of fortune, who desired to hear of Your unlimited activities and transcendental glories.",
        "purport": " The association of devotees (\u0101rya-sa\u1e45gama) is the most important factor in this world. The word \u0101rya refers to those who are advancing spiritually. In the history of the human race, the \u0100ryan family is considered to be the most elevated community in the world because it adopts the Vedic civilization. The \u0100ryan family is distributed all over the world and is known as Indo-\u0100ryan. In prehistoric days all of the members of the \u0100ryan family followed the Vedic principles, and therefore they became spiritually advanced. The kings, known as r\u0101jar\u1e63is, were so perfectly educated as k\u1e63atriyas, or protectors of the citizens, and so greatly advanced in spiritual life, that there was not a bit of trouble for the citizens. The glorification of the Supreme Lord can be very much appreciated by the \u0100ryan family. Although there is no bar for others, the members of the \u0100ryan family very quickly catch the essence of spiritual life. How is it that we are finding it very easy to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness among the Europeans and Americans? History reports that the Americans and Europeans proved their capability when they were anxious to expand colonization, but at the present time, being contaminated by the advancement of material science, their sons and grandsons are turning into reprobates. This is due to their having lost their original spiritual culture, which is Vedic civilization. Presently these descendants of the \u0100ryan family are taking this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement very seriously. Others who are associating with them and hearing the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra from the lips of pure devotees are also becoming captivated by the transcendental vibration. Transcendental vibrations are very much effective when chanted among \u0100ryans, but even though one does not belong to the \u0100ryan family, he will become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava simply by hearing the mantra because the vibration has great influence over everyone. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu points out that even the goddess of fortune, who is the constant companion of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, specifically wanted to hear about the Lord\u2019s glories, and for the association of the gop\u012bs, who are pure devotees, the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, underwent severe austerities. The impersonalist may ask why one should bother chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra continually for so many years instead of stopping and trying for kaivalya, liberation, or merging into the existence of the Lord. In answer, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu maintains that the attraction of this chanting is so great that one cannot give up the process unless he is an animal. This is the case even if one comes in contact with this transcendental vibration by chance. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is very emphatic in this connection \u2014 only an animal can give up the practice of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Those who are not animals but actually intelligent, advanced, human, civilized men cannot give up this practice of continually chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."

I am afraid that the goddess of fortune and I would quarrel because both of us would be attentively engaged in the same service.",
        "purport": " The Lord is here addressed as akhila-p\u016bru\u1e63ottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the entire creation. Puru\u1e63a means \u201cthe enjoyer,\u201d and uttama means \u201cthe best.\u201d There are different kinds of puru\u1e63as, or enjoyers, within the universe. Generally they can be divided into three classes: those who are conditioned, those who are liberated and those who are eternal. In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is called the supreme eternal of all eternals (nityo nity\u0101n\u0101m). Both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities are eternal. The supreme eternals are the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, or Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and His expansions. So nitya refers to the Personality of Godhead, beginning from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and other expansions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u), there are millions and trillions of expansions of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha and other incarnations. All of them are called eternals. The word mukta refers to the living entities who never come within this material world. The baddhas are those living entities who are almost eternally living within this material world. The baddhas are struggling very hard within this material world to become free from the threefold miseries of material nature and to enjoy life, whereas the muktas are already liberated. They never come into this material world. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the master of this material world, and there is no question of His being controlled by material nature. Consequently, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is addressed here as p\u016bru\u1e63ottama, the best of all living entities, namely vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattvas and j\u012bva-tattvas. It is a great offense, therefore, to compare Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and the j\u012bva-tattva or consider them on an equal level. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers equate the j\u012bvas and the Supreme Lord and consider them to be one, but that is the greatest offense to the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Here in the material world we have practical experience that a superior person is worshiped by an inferior one. Similarly, p\u016bru\u1e63ottama, the greatest, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is always worshiped by others. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore decided to engage in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is considered to be an incarnation of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but he is called a \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba incarnation. Another significant word in this verse is gu\u1e47\u0101layam, which refers to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as the reservoir of all transcendental qualities. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, in accordance with the impersonalistic view, take the Absolute Truth to be nirgu\u1e47a, \u201cwithout qualities,\u201d but actually the Lord is the reservoir of all good qualities. One of the most important qualities of the Lord is His inclination to His devotees, for which He is called bhakta-vatsala. The devotees are always very much inclined to render service unto the lotus feet of the Lord, and the Lord is also very much inclined to accept loving service from His devotees. In that exchange of service there are many transcendental transactions, which are called transcendental qualitative activities. Some of the transcendental qualities of the Lord are that He is omniscient, omnipresent, all-pervasive, all-powerful, the cause of all causes, the Absolute Truth, the reservoir of all pleasures, the reservoir of all knowledge, the all-auspicious and so on. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja desired to serve the Lord with the goddess of fortune, but this desire does not mean that he was situated on the platform of m\u0101dhurya-rasa. The goddess of fortune is engaged in the service of the Lord in the rasa of m\u0101dhurya, conjugal love. Although her position is on the chest of the Lord, the goddess of fortune, in her position as a devotee, takes pleasure in serving the lotus feet of the Lord. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was thinking only of the lotus feet of the Lord because he is on the platform of d\u0101sya-rasa, or servitorship of the Lord. From the next verse we learn that P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was thinking of the goddess of fortune as the universal mother, jagan-m\u0101t\u0101. Consequently there was no question of his competing with her on the platform of m\u0101dhurya-rasa. Nonetheless he feared that she might take offense at his engaging in the service of the Lord. This suggests that in the absolute world there is sometimes competition between servitors in the service of the Lord, but such competition is without malice. In the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha worlds if a devotee excels in the service of the Lord, others do not become envious of his excellent service but rather aspire to come to the platform of that service."

        "translation": "My dear Lord of the universe, the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, is the mother of the universe, and yet I think that she may be angry with me because of my intruding upon her service and acting on that very platform to which she is so much attached. Yet I am hopeful that even though there is some misunderstanding, You will take my part, for You are very much inclined to the poor, and You always magnify even insignificant service unto You. Therefore even though she becomes angry, I think that there is no harm for You, because You are so self-sufficient that You can do without her.",
        "purport": " Mother Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b, the goddess of fortune, is well known for always massaging the lotus feet of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. She is an ideal wife because she takes care of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in every detail. She takes care not only of His lotus feet but of the household affairs of the Lord as well. She cooks nice foods for Him, fans Him while He eats, smoothes sandalwood pulp on His face and sets His bed and sitting places in the right order. In this way she is always engaged in the service of the Lord, and there is hardly any opportunity for any other devotee to intrude upon His daily activities. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was therefore almost certain that his intrusion into the service of the goddess of fortune would irritate her and cause her to become angry with him. But why should mother Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the mother of the universe, be angry with an insignificant devotee like P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja? All this was not very likely. Yet P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, just for his personal protection, appealed to the Lord to take his part. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was engaged in performing the ordinary Vedic rituals and sacrifices according to karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, or fruitive activities, but the Lord, being so kind and magnanimous, was ready to award P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja the highest perfectional stage of life, namely devotional service. When a person performs Vedic rituals and sacrifices, he does so to elevate himself to the heavenly planets. No one can become qualified to go back home, back to Godhead, by means of such sacrifices. But the Lord is so kind that He accepts a little insignificant service, and therefore it is stated in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a that by following the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma one can satisfy the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is satisfied, the performer of sacrifices is elevated to the platform of devotional service. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore expected that his insignificant service to the Lord would be accepted by Him as being greater than that of Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b. The goddess of fortune is called ca\u00f1cal\u0101, \u201crestless,\u201d because she is very restless and is always coming and going. So P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja indicated that even though she might go away out of anger, there would be no harm for Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, because He is self-sufficient and can do anything and everything without the help of Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b. For example, when Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u begot Lord Brahm\u0101 from His navel, He did not take any help from Lak\u1e63m\u012b, who was just sitting by Him and massaging His lotus feet. Generally if a son is to be begotten, the husband impregnates the wife, and in due course of time the son is born. But in the case of Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s birth, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u did not impregnate Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b. Being self-sufficient, the Lord begot Brahm\u0101 from His own navel. Therefore, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was confident that even if the goddess of fortune became angry with him there would be no harm, neither to the Lord nor to himself."

O my Lord, there is no reason for the liberated souls to take shelter at Your lotus feet except that such souls are constantly thinking of Your feet.",
        "purport": " The karm\u012bs are generally engaged in fruitive activities for material bodily comforts. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, however, are disgusted with searching after material comforts. They understand that they have nothing to do with this material world, being spirit souls. After self-realization, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who are actually mature in their knowledge must surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante). Self-realization is not complete unless one comes to the devotional platform. Therefore it is stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that those who are \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma, self-satisfied, are freed from all contaminations of the material modes of nature. As long as one is affected by the modes of material nature, especially by rajas and tamas, he will be very greedy and lusty and will therefore engage in hard tasks, laboring all day and night. Such false egoism carries one from one species of life into another perpetually, and there is no rest in any species of life. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b understands this fact and therefore ceases to work and takes to karma-sanny\u0101sa. Yet this is not actually the platform of satisfaction. After self-realization, the material wisdom of the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b leads him to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. Then he is satisfied only in contemplating the lotus feet of the Lord constantly. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore concluded that liberated persons taking to the devotional path have acquired the ultimate goal of life. If liberation were the end in itself, there would be no question of a liberated person\u2019s taking to devotional service. In other words, the transcendental bliss derived from self-realization, known as \u0101tm\u0101nanda, is very insignificant in the presence of the bliss derived from devotional service to the lotus feet of the Lord. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore concluded that he would simply hear of the glories of the Lord constantly and thus engage his mind upon the lotus feet of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life."

The allurements You offer in the Vedas are certainly not suitable for pure devotees. People in general, bound by the sweet words of the Vedas, engage themselves again and again in fruitive activities, enamored by the results of their actions.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a great \u0101c\u0101rya of the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya samprad\u0101ya, has said that persons who are very much attached to the fruitive activities of the Vedas, namely karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da and j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, are certainly doomed. In the Vedas there are three categories of activities, known as karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (fruitive activities), j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (philosophical research) and up\u0101san\u0101-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (worship of different demigods for receiving material benefits). Those who are engaged in karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da and j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da are doomed in the sense that everyone is doomed who is entrapped by this material body, whether it is a body of a demigod, a king, a lower animal or whatever. The sufferings of the threefold miseries of material nature are the same for all. Cultivation of knowledge to understand one\u2019s spiritual position is also, to a certain extent, a waste of time. Because the living entity is an eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his immediate business is to engage himself in devotional service. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore says that the allurement of material benedictions is another trap to entangle one in this material world. He therefore frankly tells the Lord that the Lord\u2019s offerings of benedictions in the form of material facilities are certainly causes for bewilderment. A pure devotee is not at all interested in bhukti or mukti. The Lord sometimes offers benedictions to the neophyte devotees who have not yet understood that material facilities will not make them happy. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta the Lord therefore says that a sincere devotee who is not very intelligent may ask some material benefit from the Lord, but the Lord, being omniscient, does not generally give material rewards but, on the contrary, takes away whatever material facilities are being enjoyed by His devotee, so that ultimately the devotee will completely surrender unto Him. In other words, the offering of benedictions in the form of material profit is never auspicious for the devotee. The statements of the Vedas which offer elevation to heavenly planets in exchange for great sacrifices are simply bewildering. Therefore in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.42) the Lord says, y\u0101m im\u0101\u1e41 pu\u1e63pit\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101ca\u1e41 pravadanty avipa\u015bcita\u1e25: the less intelligent class of men (avipa\u015bcita\u1e25), attracted by the flowery language of the Vedas, engage in fruitive activities to become materially benefited. Thus they continue life after life, in different bodily forms, to search very, very hard."

        "translation": "My Lord, due to Your illusory energy, all living beings in this material world have forgotten their real constitutional position, and out of ignorance they are always desirous of material happiness in the form of society, friendship and love. Therefore, please do not ask me to take some material benefits from You, but as a father, not waiting for the son\u2019s demand, does everything for the benefit of the son, please bestow upon me whatever You think best for me.",
        "purport": " It is the duty of the son to depend upon his father without asking anything from him. The good son has faith that the father knows best how to benefit him. Similarly, a pure devotee does not ask anything from the Lord for material benefit. Nor does he ask anything for spiritual benefit. The pure devotee is fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord, and the Lord takes charge of him, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi. The father knows the necessities of the son and supplies them, and the Supreme Lord knows the necessities of the living entities and supplies them sumptuously. Therefore the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad states that everything in this material world is complete (p\u016br\u1e47am idam). The difficulty is that due to forgetfulness the living entities create unnecessary demands and entangle themselves in material activities. The result is that there is no end to material activities, life after life. Before us there are varieties of living entities, and everyone is entangled in transmigrations and activities. Our duty is simply to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead and let Him take charge, for He knows what is good for us. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore tells the Lord that, as the supreme father, He may elect to bestow whatever He considers beneficial for P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. That is the perfect position of the living entity. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu teaches us in His \u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka: \u201cO Almighty Lord! I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor have I any desire to enjoy beautiful women, nor do I want any number of followers. I only want Your causeless devotional service in my life, birth after birth.\u201d The conclusion is that the pure devotee should not aspire after any material benefit from devotional service, nor should he be enamored by fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. He should always be engaged favorably in the service of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life."

No one can transcend the illusory energy of m\u0101y\u0101 by fruitive activity, speculative philosophy or mystic yoga. The only means for transcending illusory energy is devotional service, as the Lord Himself states: m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te (Bg. 7.14). If one wants to cross over the ocean of material existence, there is no alternative than to take to devotional service. A devotee, therefore, should not care for any material position, whether in heaven or in hell. A pure devotee should always engage in the service of the Lord, for that is his real occupation. Simply by sticking to that position, one can overcome the stringent laws of material nature."

        "purport": " Most important in this verse are the words pratinandy\u0101rthavad vaca\u1e25, which indicate that the Lord appreciated the very meaningful prayers of the King. When a devotee prays to the Lord, it is not to ask for material benefits but to ask the Lord for His favor; he prays that he may be engaged in the service of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet birth after birth. Lord Caitanya therefore uses the words mama janmani janmani, which mean \u201cbirth after birth,\u201d because a devotee is not even interested in stopping the repetition of birth. The Lord and the devotee appear in this material world birth after birth, but such births are transcendental. In the Fourth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord informed Arjuna that both He and Arjuna had undergone many, many births previously, but the Lord remembered everything about them whereas Arjuna had forgotten. The Lord and His confidential devotees appear many times to fulfill the Lord\u2019s mission, but since such births are transcendental, they are not accompanied by the miserable conditions of material birth, and they are therefore called divya, transcendental. One must understand the transcendental birth of the Lord and the devotee. The purpose of the Lord\u2019s taking birth is to establish devotional service, which is the perfect system of religion, and the purpose of the birth of a devotee is to broadcast the same system of religion, or the bhakti cult, all over the world. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was an incarnation of the power of the Lord to spread the bhakti cult, and the Lord blessed him to remain fixed in his position. Thus when the King refused to accept any material benediction, the Lord appreciated that refusal very much. Another significant word in this verse is acyuta, which means \u201cinfallible.\u201d Although the Lord appears in this material world, He is never to be considered one of the conditioned souls, who are all fallible. When the Lord appears, He remains in His spiritual position, uncontaminated by the modes of material nature, and therefore in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord expresses the quality of His appearance as \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101, \u201cperformed by internal potency.\u201d The Lord, being infallible, is not forced by material nature to take birth in this material world. He appears in order to reestablish the perfect order of religious principles and to vanquish the demoniac influence in human society."

He also worshiped many other living entities who presented themselves in the sacrificial arena. With folded hands he worshiped all these, as well as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the personal associates of the Lord, by offering sweet words and as much wealth as possible. After this function, they all went back to their respective abodes, following in the footsteps of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.",
        "purport": " In modern so-called scientific society the idea is very prevalent that there is no life on other planets but that only on this earth do living entities with intelligence and scientific knowledge exist. The Vedic literatures, however, do not accept this foolish theory. The followers of Vedic wisdom are fully aware of various planets inhabited by varieties of living entities such as the demigods, the sages, the Pit\u0101s, the Gandharvas, the Pannagas, the Kinnaras, the C\u0101ra\u1e47as, the Siddhas and the Apsar\u0101s. The Vedas give information that in all planets \u2014 not only within this material sky but also in the spiritual sky \u2014 there are varieties of living entities. Although all these living entities are of one spiritual nature, in quality the same as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they have varieties of bodies due to the embodiment of the spirit soul by the eight material elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego. In the spiritual world, however, there is no such distinction between the body and the embodied. In the material world, distinctive features are manifested in different types of bodies in the various planets. We have full information from the Vedic literature that in each and every planet, both material and spiritual, there are living entities of varied intelligence. The earth is one of the planets of the Bh\u016brloka planetary system. There are six planetary systems above Bh\u016brloka and seven planetary systems below it. Therefore the entire universe is known as caturda\u015ba-bhuvana, indicating that it has fourteen different planetary systems. Beyond the planetary systems in the material sky, there is another sky, which is known as paravyoma, or the spiritual sky, where there are spiritual planets. The inhabitants of those planets engage in varieties of loving service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which include different rasas, or relationships, known as d\u0101sya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, v\u0101tsalya-rasa, m\u0101dhurya-rasa and, above all, parak\u012bya-rasa. This parak\u012bya-rasa, or paramour love, is prevalent in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, where Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a lives. This planet is also called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a lives there perpetually, He also expands Himself in millions and trillions of forms. In one of such forms He appears on this material planet in a particular place known as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana-dh\u0101ma, where He displays His original pastimes of Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana-dh\u0101ma in the spiritual sky in order to attract the conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead."

Because he falls down from his real engagement in the service of the Lord, the living entity gets a material body to suffer or try to enjoy in the miserable material conditions of life. Therefore the fallen living entity is cyuta, whereas the Lord is called acyuta. The Lord was attractive for everyone \u2014 not only the King but also the priestly order, who were very much addicted to the performance of Vedic rituals. Because the Lord is all-attractive, He is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or \u201cone who attracts everyone.\u201d The Lord appeared in the sacrificial arena of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu as K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is a plenary expansion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.
