        "translation": "The great sage N\u0101rada continued: My dear King, after bewildering her husband in different ways and bringing him under her control, the wife of King Pura\u00f1jana gave him all satisfaction and enjoyed sex life with him.",
        "purport": " After hunting in the forest, King Pura\u00f1jana returned home, and after refreshing himself by taking a bath and eating nice food, he searched for his wife. When he saw her lying down on the ground without a bed, as if neglected, and devoid of any proper dress, he became very much aggrieved. He then became attracted to her and began to enjoy her company. A living entity is similarly engaged in the material world in sinful activities. These sinful activities may be compared to King Pura\u00f1jana\u2019s hunting in the forest. A sinful life can be counteracted by various processes of religion such as yaj\u00f1a, vrata and d\u0101na \u2014 that is, the performance of sacrifices, the taking of a vow for some religious ritual, and the giving of charity. In this way one may become free from the reactions of sinful life and at the same time awaken his original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. By coming home, taking his bath, eating nice foodstuffs, getting refreshed and searching out his wife, King Pura\u00f1jana came to his good consciousness in his family life. In other words, a systematic family life as enjoined in the Vedas is better than an irresponsible sinful life. If a husband and wife combine together in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and live together peacefully, that is very nice. However, if a husband becomes too much attracted by his wife and forgets his duty in life, the implications of materialistic life will again resume. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has therefore recommended, an\u0101saktasya vi\u1e63ay\u0101n (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.255). Without being attached by sex, the husband and wife may live together for the advancement of spiritual life. The husband should engage in devotional service, and the wife should be faithful and religious according to the Vedic injunctions. Such a combination is very good. However, if the husband becomes too much attracted to the wife due to sex, the position becomes very dangerous. Women in general are very much sexually inclined. Indeed, it is said that a woman\u2019s sex desire is nine times stronger than a man\u2019s. It is therefore a man\u2019s duty to keep a woman under his control by satisfying her, giving her ornaments, nice food and clothes, and engaging her in religious activities. Of course, a woman should have a few children and in this way not be disturbing to the man. Unfortunately, if the man becomes attracted to the woman simply for sex enjoyment, then family life becomes abominable. The great politician C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita has said, bh\u0101ry\u0101 r\u016bpavat\u012b \u015batru\u1e25: a beautiful wife is an enemy. Of course every woman in the eyes of her husband is very beautiful. Others may see her as not very beautiful, but the husband, being very much attracted to her, sees her always as very beautiful. If the husband sees the wife as very beautiful, it is to be assumed that he is too much attracted to her. This attraction is the attraction of sex. The whole world is captivated by the two modes of material nature rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a, passion and ignorance. Generally women are very much passionate and are less intelligent; therefore somehow or other a man should not be under the control of their passion and ignorance. By performing bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, a man can be raised to the platform of goodness. If a husband situated in the mode of goodness can control his wife, who is in passion and ignorance, the woman is benefited. Forgetting her natural inclination for passion and ignorance, the woman becomes obedient and faithful to her husband, who is situated in goodness. Such a life becomes very welcome. The intelligence of the man and woman may then work very nicely together, and they can make a progressive march toward spiritual realization. Otherwise, the husband, coming under the control of the wife, sacrifices his quality of goodness and becomes subservient to the qualities of passion and ignorance. In this way the whole situation becomes polluted. The conclusion is that a household life is better than a sinful life devoid of responsibility, but if in the household life the husband becomes subordinate to the wife, involvement in materialistic life again becomes prominent. In this way a man\u2019s material bondage becomes enhanced. Because of this, according to the Vedic system, after a certain age a man is recommended to abandon his family life for the stages of v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa."

        "purport": " A woman is generally accustomed to dress herself nicely with fine garments and decorative ornaments. She may even sometimes wear flowers in her hair. Women especially dress themselves up in the evening because the husband comes home in the evening after working hard all day. It is the duty of the wife to dress herself up very nicely so that when her husband returns home he becomes attracted by her dress and cleanliness and thus becomes satisfied. In other words, the wife is the inspiration of all good intelligence. Upon seeing one\u2019s wife dressed nicely, one can think very soberly about family business. When a person is too anxious about family affairs, he cannot discharge his family duties nicely. A wife is therefore supposed to be an inspiration and should keep the husband\u2019s intelligence in good order so that they can combinedly prosecute the affairs of family life without impediment."

Thus King Pura\u00f1jana became very much captivated by his beautiful wife and deviated from his good sense. He forgot that the passing of days and nights meant that his span of life was being reduced without profit.",
        "purport": " The word pramad\u0101 in this verse is very significant. A beautiful wife is certainly enlivening to her husband, but at the same time is the cause of degradation. The word pramad\u0101 means \u201cenlivening\u201d as well as \u201cmaddening.\u201d Generally a householder does not take the passing of days and nights very seriously. A person in ignorance takes it as the usual course that days come, and after the days, the nights come. This is the law of material nature. But a man in ignorance does not know that when the sun rises early in the morning it begins to take away the balance of his life. Thus day after day the span of one\u2019s life is reduced, and forgetting the duty of human life, the foolish man simply remains in the company of his wife and enjoys her in a secluded place. Such a condition is called apak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-cetana, or degraded consciousness. Human consciousness should be used for elevation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. But when a person is too much attracted to his wife and family affairs, he does not take K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness very seriously. He thus becomes degraded, not knowing that he cannot buy back even a second of his life in return for millions of dollars. The greatest loss in life is passing time without understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Every moment of our lives should be utilized properly, and the proper use of life is to increase devotional service to the Lord. Without devotional service to the Lord, the activities of life become simply a waste of time (\u015brama eva hi kevalam). Simply by becoming \u201cdutiful\u201d we do not make any profit in life. As confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.8): If after performing one\u2019s occupational duty very perfectly one does not make progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it should be understood that he has simply wasted his time in valueless labor."

In this way he considered woman to be his ultimate life and soul. Becoming thus overwhelmed by the mode of ignorance, he could not understand the meaning of self-realization, whether regarding his own self or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " Human life is meant for self-realization. First of all one has to realize his own self, which is described in this verse as nijam. Then he has to understand or realize the Supersoul, or Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, when one becomes too much materially attached, he takes a woman to be everything. This is the basic principle of material attachment. In such a condition, one cannot realize his own self or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.2) it is therefore said, mahat-sev\u0101\u1e41 dv\u0101ram \u0101hur vimuktes tamo-dv\u0101ra\u1e41 yo\u1e63it\u0101\u1e41 sa\u1e45gi-sa\u1e45gam. If one associates with mah\u0101tm\u0101s, or devotees, his path of liberation is opened. But if one becomes too much attached to women or to persons who are also attached to women \u2014 that is, attached to women directly or indirectly \u2014 he opens the tamo-dv\u0101ram, the door to the darkest region of hellish life. King Pura\u00f1jana was a great soul, highly intellectual and possessed of advanced consciousness, but due to his being too much addicted to women, his whole consciousness was covered. In the modern age the consciousness of people is too much covered by wine, women and flesh. Consequently, people are completely unable to make any progress in self-realization. The first step of self-realization is to know oneself as spirit soul apart from the body. In the second stage of self-realization, one comes to know that every soul, every individual living entity, is part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7): \u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\u201d All living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Unfortunately, in this present civilization both men and women are allowed to be attracted to one another from the very beginning of life, and because of this they are completely unable to come to the platform of self-realization. They do not know that without self-realization they suffer the greatest loss in the human form of life. Thinking of a woman always within one\u2019s heart is tantamount to lying down with a woman on a valuable bedstead. The heart is the bedstead, and it is the most valuable bedstead. When a man thinks of women and money, he lies down and rests on the arms of his beloved woman or wife. In this way he overindulges in sex life and thus becomes unfit for self-realization."

        "translation": "My dear King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at, in this way King Pura\u00f1jana, with his heart full of lust and sinful reactions, began to enjoy sex with his wife, and in this way his new life and youth expired in half a moment.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Govinda d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has sung: In this verse \u015ar\u012bla Govinda d\u0101sa actually says that there is no bliss in the enjoyment of youthful life. In youth a person becomes very lusty to enjoy all kinds of sense objects. The sense objects are form, taste, smell, touch and sound. The modern scientific method, or advancement of scientific civilization, encourages the enjoyment of these five senses. The younger generation is very pleased to see a beautiful form, to hear radio messages of material news and sense gratificatory songs, to smell nice scents and nice flowers, and to touch the soft body or breasts of a young woman and gradually touch the sex organs. All of this is also very pleasing to the animals; therefore in human society there are restrictions in the enjoyment of the five sense objects. If one does not follow, he becomes exactly like an animal. Thus in this verse it is specifically stated, k\u0101ma-ka\u015bmala-cetasa\u1e25: the consciousness of King Pura\u00f1jana was polluted by lusty desires and sinful activities. In the previous verse it is stated that Pura\u00f1jana, although advanced in consciousness, lay down on a very soft bed with his wife. This indicates that he indulged too much in sex. The words nava\u1e41 vaya\u1e25 are also significant in this verse. They indicate the period of youth from age sixteen to thirty. These thirteen or fifteen years of life are years in which one can very strongly enjoy the senses. When one comes to this age he thinks that life will go on and that he will simply continue enjoying his senses. But \u201ctime and tide wait for no man\u201d \u2014 the span of youth expires very quickly. One who wastes his life simply by committing sinful activities in youth immediately becomes disappointed and disillusioned when the brief period of youth is over. The material enjoyments of youth are especially pleasing to a person who has no spiritual training. If one is trained only according to the bodily conception of life, he simply leads a disappointed life because bodily sense enjoyment finishes within forty years or so. After forty years, one simply leads a disillusioned life because he has no spiritual knowledge. For such a person, the expiration of youth occurs in half a moment. Thus King Pura\u00f1jana\u2019s pleasure, which he took in lying down with his wife, expired very quickly. K\u0101ma-ka\u015bmala-cetasa\u1e25 also indicates that unrestricted sense enjoyment is not allowed in the human form of life by the laws of nature. If one enjoys his senses unrestrictedly, he leads a sinful life. The animals do not violate the laws of nature. For example, the sex impulse in animals is very strong during certain months of the year. The lion is very powerful. He is a flesh-eater and is very strong, but he enjoys sex only once in a year. Similarly, according to religious injunctions a man is restricted to enjoying sex only once in a month, after the menstrual period of the wife, and if the wife is pregnant, he is not allowed sex life at all. That is the law for human beings. A man is allowed to keep more than one wife because he cannot enjoy sex when the wife is pregnant. If he wants to enjoy sex at such a time, he may go to another wife who is not pregnant. These are laws mentioned in the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and other scriptures. These laws and scriptures are meant for human beings. As such, if one violates these laws, he becomes sinful. The conclusion is that unrestricted sense enjoyment means sinful activities. Illicit sex is sex that violates the laws given in the scriptures. When one violates the laws of the scriptures, or the Vedas, he commits sinful activities. One who is engaged in sinful activities cannot change his consciousness. Our real function is to change our consciousness from ka\u015bmala, sinful consciousness, to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme pure. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n), K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme pure, and if we change our consciousness from material enjoyment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we become purified. This is the process recommended by Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu as the process of ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam, cleansing the mirror of the heart."

However, in this business he passed away half of his life span.",
        "purport": " In this verse there are several significant words, the first of which are ek\u0101da\u015ba \u015bat\u0101ni. Pura\u00f1jana had begotten 1,100 sons within the womb of his wife and thus passed away half of his life. Actually every man follows a similar process. If one lives for one hundred years at the utmost, in his family life he simply begets children up to the age of fifty. Unfortunately at the present moment people do not live even a hundred years; nonetheless they beget children up to the age of sixty. Another point is that formerly people used to beget one hundred to two hundred sons and daughters. As will be evident from the next verse, King Pura\u00f1jana not only begot 1,100 sons but also 110 daughters. At the present moment no one can produce such huge quantities of children. Instead, mankind is very busy checking the increase of population by contraceptive methods. We do not find in Vedic literatures that they ever used contraceptive methods, although they were begetting hundreds of children. Checking population by contraceptive method is another sinful activity, but in this Age of Kali people have become so sinful that they do not care for the resultant reactions of their sinful lives. King Pura\u00f1jana lay down with his wife, Pura\u00f1jan\u012b, and begot a large number of children, and there is no mention in these verses that he used contraceptive methods. According to the Vedic scriptures the contraceptive method should be restraint in sex life. It is not that one should indulge in unrestricted sex life and avoid children by using some method to check pregnancy. If a man is in good consciousness, he consults with his religious wife, and as a result of this consultation, with intelligence, one advances in his ability to estimate the value of life. In other words, if one is fortunate enough to have a good, conscientious wife, he can decide by mutual consultation that human life is meant for advancing in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and not for begetting a large number of children. Children are called pari\u1e47\u0101ma, or by-products, and when one consults his good intelligence he can see that his by-products should be the expansion of his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " Children begotten under the rules and regulations of the scriptures generally become as good as the father and mother, but children born illegitimately mainly become var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara. The var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara population is irresponsible to the family, community and even to themselves. Formerly the var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara population was checked by the observation of the reformatory method called garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, a child-begetting religious ceremony. In this verse we find that although King Pura\u00f1jana had begotten so many children, they were not var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara. All of them were good, well-behaved children, and they had good qualities like their father and mother. Even though we may produce many good children, our desire for sex that is beyond the prescribed method is to be considered sinful. Too much enjoyment of any of the senses (not only sex) results in sinful activities. Therefore one has to become a sv\u0101m\u012b or gosv\u0101m\u012b at the end of his life. One may beget children up to the age of fifty, but after fifty one must stop begetting children and should accept the v\u0101naprastha order. In this way he must leave home and then become a sanny\u0101s\u012b. A sanny\u0101s\u012b\u2019s title is sv\u0101m\u012b or gosv\u0101m\u012b, which means that he completely refrains from sense enjoyment. One should not accept the sanny\u0101sa order whimsically; he must be fully confident that he can restrain his desires for sense gratification. King Pura\u00f1jana\u2019s family life was, of course, very happy. As mentioned in these verses, he begot 1,100 sons and 110 daughters. Everyone desires to have more sons than daughters, and since the number of daughters was less than the number of sons, it appears that King Pura\u00f1jana\u2019s family life was very comfortable and pleasing."

The offering of oblations in the name of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is called pi\u1e47\u1e0dodaka, and it is necessary that the descendants of a family offer pi\u1e47\u1e0da to the forefathers. Not only was Pura\u00f1jana, the King of Pa\u00f1c\u0101la, satisfied in his own sex life, but he arranged for the sex life of his 1,100 sons and 110 daughters. In this way one can elevate an aristocratic family to the platform of a dynasty. It is significant in this verse that Pura\u00f1jana got both sons and daughters married. It is the duty of a father and mother to arrange for the marriage of their sons and daughters. That is the obligation in Vedic society. Sons and daughters should not be allowed freedom to intermingle with the opposite sex unless they are married. This Vedic social organization is very good in that it stops the promulgation of illicit sex life, or var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara, which appears under different names in this present day. Unfortunately, in this age, although the father and mother are anxious to get their children married, the children refuse to get married by the arrangement of the parents. Consequently, the number of var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara has increased throughout the world under different names."

        "purport": " We must remember that Pura\u00f1jana is the living entity, and the city Pa\u00f1c\u0101la is the body. The body is the field of activity for the living entity, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: k\u1e63etra-k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a. There are two constituents: one is the living entity (k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a), and the other is the body of the living entity (k\u1e63etra). Any living entity can know that he is covered by the body if he only contemplates the body a little bit. Just with a little contemplation he can come to understand that the body is his possession. One can understand this by practical experience and by the authority of the \u015b\u0101stras. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.13) it is said, dehino \u2019smin yath\u0101 dehe: the proprietor of the body, the soul, is within the body. The body is taken as the pa\u00f1c\u0101la-de\u015ba, or the field of activities wherein the living entity can enjoy the senses in their relationship to the five sense objects, namely gandha, rasa, r\u016bpa, spar\u015ba and \u015babda \u2014 that is, sense objects made out of earth, water, fire, air and sky. Within this material world, covered by the material body of subtle and gross matter, every living entity creates actions and reactions, which are herein known allegorically as sons and grandsons. There are two kinds of actions and reactions \u2014 namely pious and impious. In this way our material existence becomes coated by different actions and reactions. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura states: \u201cFruitive activities and mental speculation are simply cups of poison. Whoever drinks of them, thinking them to be nectar, must struggle very hard life after life, in different types of bodies. Such a person eats all kinds of nonsense and becomes condemned by his activities of so-called sense enjoyment.\u201d Thus the field of action and reactions, by which one\u2019s descendants are increased, begins with sex life. Pura\u00f1jana increased his whole family by begetting sons who in their turn begot grandsons. Thus the living entity, being inclined toward sexual gratification, becomes involved in many hundreds and thousands of actions and reactions. In this way he remains within the material world simply for the purpose of sense gratification and transmigrates from one body to another. His process of reproducing so many sons and grandsons results in so-called societies, nations, communities and so on. All these communities, societies, dynasties and nations simply expand from sex life. As stated by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, yan maithun\u0101di-g\u1e5bhamedhi-sukha\u1e41 hi tuccham (Bh\u0101g. 7.9.45). A g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b is one who wants to remain within this material existence. This means that he wants to remain within this body or society and enjoy friendship, love and community. His only enjoyment is in increasing the number of sex enjoyers. He enjoys sex and produces children, who in their turn marry and produce grandchildren. The grandchildren also marry and in their turn produce great-grandchildren. In this way the entire earth becomes overpopulated, and then suddenly there are reactions provoked by material nature in the form of war, famine, pestilence, earthquakes, etc. Thus the entire population is again extinguished simply to be re-created. This process is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.19) as repeated creation and annihilation: bh\u016btv\u0101 bh\u016btv\u0101 pral\u012byate. Due to a lack of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all this creation and annihilation is going on under the name of human civilization. This cycle continues due to man\u2019s lack of knowledge of the soul and the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " In this verse the word riktha-h\u0101re\u1e63u, meaning \u201cplunderers of wealth,\u201d is very significant. One\u2019s sons, grandsons and other descendants are ultimately plunderers of one\u2019s accumulated wealth. There are many celebrated businessmen and industrialists who produce great wealth and are highly praised by the public, but all their money is ultimately plundered by their sons and grandsons. In India we have actually seen one industrialist who, like King Pura\u00f1jana, was very much sexually inclined and had a half dozen wives. Each of these wives had a separate establishment that necessitated the expenditure of several thousands of rupees. When I was engaged in talking with him, I saw that he was very busy trying to secure money so that all his sons and daughters would get at least five hundred thousand rupees each. Thus such industrialists, businessmen or karm\u012bs are called m\u016b\u1e0dhas in the \u015b\u0101stras. They work very hard, accumulate money, and are satisfied to see that this money is plundered by their sons and grandsons. Such people do not want to return their wealth to its actual owner. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29), bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram: the real proprietor of all wealth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the actual enjoyer. So-called earners of money are those who simply know tricks by which they can take away God\u2019s money under the guise of business and industry. After accumulating this money, they enjoy seeing it plundered by their sons and grandsons. This is the materialistic way of life. In materialistic life one is encaged within the body and deluded by false egoism. Thus one thinks, \u201cI am this body,\u201d \u201cI am a human being,\u201d \u201cI am an American,\u201d \u201cI am an Indian.\u201d This bodily conception is due to false ego. Being deluded by false ego, one identifies himself with a certain family, nation or community. In this way one\u2019s attachment for the material world grows deeper and deeper. Thus it becomes very difficult for the living entity to extricate himself from his entanglement. Such people are graphically described in the Sixteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.13-15) in this way: \u201cThe demoniac person thinks: \u2018So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him; and my other enemy will also be killed. I am the lord of everything, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.\u2019 In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance.\u201d In this way people engage in various laborious activities, and their attachment for body, home, family, nation and community becomes more and more deep-rooted."

Thus he worshiped demigods, forefathers and social leaders with various sacrifices which were all very ghastly because they were inspired by the desire to kill animals.",
        "purport": " In this verse the great sage N\u0101rada discloses that the character of Pura\u00f1jana was being described to give lessons to King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at. Actually the entire description was figuratively describing the activities of King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at. In this verse N\u0101rada frankly says \u201clike you\u201d (yath\u0101 bhav\u0101n), which indicates that King Pura\u00f1jana is none other than King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at himself. Being a great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, N\u0101rada Muni wanted to stop animal-killing in sacrifices. He knew that if he tried to stop the King from performing sacrifices, the King would not hear him. Therefore he is describing the life of Pura\u00f1jana. But in this verse he first discloses the intention, although not fully, by saying \u201clike you.\u201d Generally the karm\u012bs, who are attached to increasing descendants, have to perform so many sacrifices and worship so many demigods for future generations and satisfy so many leaders, politicians, philosophers and scientists to make things go on properly for future generations. The so-called scientists are very eager to see that future generations will live very comfortably, and as such they are trying to find different means of generating energy to drive locomotives, cars, airplanes and so on. Now they are exhausting the petroleum supply. These activities are described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.41): \u201cThose who are on the spiritual path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many-branched.\u201d Actually, those who are in knowledge of everything are determined to execute K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but those who are rascals (m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25), sinners (du\u1e63k\u1e5btina\u1e25) and the lowest of mankind (nar\u0101dham\u0101\u1e25), who are bereft of all intelligence (m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25) and who take shelter of the demoniac way of life (\u0101sura\u1e41 bh\u0101vam \u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25), are disinterested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As such they become implicated and take on so many activities. Most of these activities center around the killing of animals. Modern civilization is centered around animal-killing. Karm\u012bs are advertising that without eating meat, their vitamin value or vitality will be reduced; so to keep oneself fit to work hard, one must eat meat, and to digest meat, one must drink liquor, and to keep the balance of drinking wine and eating meat, one must have sufficient sexual intercourse to keep fit to work very hard like an ass. There are two ways of animal-killing. One way is in the name of religious sacrifices. All the religions of the world \u2014 except the Buddhists \u2014 have a program for killing animals in places of worship. According to Vedic civilization, the animal-eaters are recommended to sacrifice a goat in the temple of K\u0101l\u012b under certain restrictive rules and regulations and eat the flesh. Similarly, they are recommended to drink wine by worshiping the goddess Ca\u1e47\u1e0dik\u0101. The purpose is restriction. People have given up all this restriction. Now they are regularly opening wine distilleries and slaughterhouses and indulging in drinking alcohol and eating flesh. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101rya like N\u0101rada Muni knows very well that persons engaged in such animal-killing in the name of religion are certainly becoming involved in the cycle of birth and death, forgetting the real aim of life: to go home, back to Godhead. Thus the great sage N\u0101rada, while instructing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam to Vy\u0101sa Muni, condemned the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (fruitive) activities mentioned in the Vedas. N\u0101rada told Vy\u0101sa: \u201cThe people in general are naturally inclined to enjoy, and you have encouraged them in that way in the name of religion. This is verily condemned and is quite unreasonable. Because they are guided under your instructions, they will accept such activities in the name of religion and will hardly care for prohibitions.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.15) \u015ar\u012bla N\u0101rada Muni chastised Vy\u0101sadeva for compiling so many Vedic supplementary scriptures, which are all intended for guiding the people in general. N\u0101rada Muni condemned these scriptures because they do not mention direct devotional service. Under N\u0101rada\u2019s instructions, direct worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as described in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, was set forth by Vy\u0101sadeva. The conclusion is that neither the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, nor His devotee ever sanctions animal-killing in the name of religion. Indeed, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a incarnated Himself as Lord Buddha to put an end to animal-killing in the name of religion. Animal sacrifice under the name of religion is conducted by the influence of tamo-gu\u1e47a (the mode of ignorance), as indicated in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.31-32): \u201cThat understanding which cannot distinguish between the religious way of life and the irreligious, between action that should be done and action that should not be done \u2014 that imperfect understanding, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, is in the mode of passion. That understanding which considers irreligion to be religion and religion to be irreligion, under the spell of illusion and darkness, and strives always in the wrong direction, O P\u0101rtha, is in the mode of ignorance.\u201d Those who are involved in the mode of ignorance manufacture religious systems for killing animals. Actually dharma is transcendental. As Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a teaches, we must give up all other systems of religion and simply surrender unto Him (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya). Thus the Lord and His devotees and representatives teach the transcendental dharma, which does not allow animal-killing at all. At the present moment it is the greatest misfortune that in India many so-called missionary workers are spreading irreligion in the name of religion. They claim an ordinary human being to be God and recommend meat-eating for everyone, including so-called sanny\u0101s\u012bs."

        "purport": " In this verse the words priya-yo\u1e63it\u0101m and apriya\u1e25 are very significant. The word yo\u1e63it means \u201cwoman,\u201d and priya means \u201cdear\u201d or \u201cpleasing.\u201d Death is not very much welcome for those who are too much attached to material enjoyment, which culminates in sex. There is an instructive story in this connection: Once when a saintly person was passing on his way, he met a prince, the son of a king, and he blessed him, saying, \u201cMy dear prince, may you live forever.\u201d The sage next met a saintly person and said to him, \u201cYou may either live or die.\u201d Eventually the sage met a brahmac\u0101r\u012b devotee, and he blessed him, saying, \u201cMy dear devotee, you may die immediately.\u201d Finally the sage met a hunter, and he blessed him, saying, \u201cNeither live nor die.\u201d The point is that those who are very sensual and are engaged in sense gratification do not wish to die. Generally a prince has enough money to enjoy his senses; therefore the great sage said that he should live forever, for as long as he lived he could enjoy life, but after his death he would go to hell. Since the brahmac\u0101r\u012b devotee was leading a life of severe austerities and penances in order to be promoted back to Godhead, the sage said that he should die immediately so that he need not continue to labor hard and could instead go back home, back to Godhead. A saintly person may either live or die, for during his life he is engaged in serving the Lord and after his death he also serves the Lord. Thus this life and the next are the same for a saintly devotee, for in both he serves the Lord. Since the hunter lives a very ghastly life due to killing animals, and since he will go to hell when he dies, he is advised to neither live nor die. King Pura\u00f1jana finally arrived at the point of old age. In old age the senses lose their strength, and although an old man desires to enjoy his senses, and especially sex life, he is very miserable because his instruments of enjoyment no longer function. Such sensualists are never prepared for death. They simply want to live on and on and extend their life by so-called scientific advancement. Some foolish Russian scientists also claim that they are going to make man immortal through scientific advancement. Under the leadership of such crazy fellows, civilization is going on. Cruel death, however, comes and takes all of them away despite their desire to live forever. This type of mentality was exhibited by Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, but when the time was ripe, the Lord personally killed him within a second."

Since time and tide wait for no man, time is herein called Ca\u1e47\u1e0davega, which means \u201cvery swiftly passing away.\u201d As time passes, it is calculated in terms of years. One year contains 360 days, and the soldiers of Ca\u1e47\u1e0davega herein mentioned represent these days. Time passes swiftly; Ca\u1e47\u1e0davega\u2019s powerful soldiers of Gandharvaloka very swiftly carry away all the days of our life. As the sun rises and sets, it snatches away the balance of our life span. Thus as each day passes, each one of us loses some of life\u2019s duration. It is therefore said that the duration of one\u2019s life cannot be saved. But if one is engaged in devotional service, his time cannot be taken away by the sun. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.3.17), \u0101yur harati vai pu\u1e41s\u0101m udyann asta\u1e41 ca yann asau. The conclusion is that if one wants to make himself immortal, he should give up sense gratification. By engaging oneself in devotional service, one can gradually enter into the eternal kingdom of God. Mirages and other illusory things are sometimes called Gandharvas. Our losing our life span is taken as advancement of age. This imperceptible passing away of the days of life is figuratively referred to in this verse as Gandharvas. As explained in later verses, such Gandharvas are both male and female. This indicates that both men and women lose their life span imperceptibly by the force of time, which is herein described as Ca\u1e47\u1e0davega."

        "purport": " The days have been compared to the soldiers of Ca\u1e47\u1e0davega. Night is generally a time for sex enjoyment. Days are considered to be white, and nights are considered to be black, or, from another point of view, there are two kinds of nights \u2014 black nights and white nights. All these days and nights combine to pass away our span of life and everything we manufacture for sense gratification. Material activity means manufacturing things for sense gratification. Scientists are conducting research to find out how we can satisfy our senses more and more elaborately. In this Kali-yuga, the demoniac mentality is employed in manufacturing various machines to facilitate the process of sense gratification. There are so many machines for ordinary household activities. There are machines for washing dishes, cleansing the floor, shaving, clipping hair \u2014 today everything is done by machine. All these facilities for sense gratification are described in this verse as sarva-k\u0101ma-vinirmit\u0101m. The time factor, however, is so strong that not only is our span of life being expended, but all the machines and facilities for sense gratification are deteriorating. Therefore in this verse the word vilumpanti, \u201cplundering,\u201d is used. Everything is being plundered from the very beginning of our lives. This plundering of our possessions and life span begins with the day of our birth. One day will come when death will finish everything, and the living entity will have to enter another body to begin another chapter of life and again begin the cycle of material sense gratification. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja describes this process as puna\u1e25 puna\u015b carvita-carva\u1e47\u0101n\u0101m (Bh\u0101g. 7.5.30): materialistic life means chewing the chewed again and again. The central point of material life is sense gratification. In different types of bodies, the living entity enjoys various senses, and through creating various types of facilities, he chews the chewed. Whether we squeeze sugar out of the sugarcane with our teeth or a machine, the result is the same \u2014 sugarcane juice. We may discover many ways to squeeze the juice out of the sugarcane, but the result is the same."

Generally people think that religion and piety come at the end of life, and at this time one generally becomes meditative and takes to some so-called yogic process to relax in the name of meditation. Meditation, however, is simply a farce for those who have enjoyed life in sense gratification. As described in the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, meditation (dhy\u0101na, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101) is a difficult subject matter that one has to learn from his very youth. To meditate, one must restrain himself from all kinds of sense gratification. Unfortunately, meditation has now become a fashion for those who are overly addicted to sensual things. Such meditation is defeated by the struggle for existence. Sometimes such meditative processes pass for transcendental meditation. King Pura\u00f1jana, the living entity, being thus victimized by the hard struggle for existence, took to transcendental meditation with his friends and relatives."

This atheistic theory was conceived long ago by a philosopher called C\u0101rv\u0101ka. C\u0101rv\u0101ka recommended that man should live very opulently by either begging, borrowing or stealing.

Thus Jar\u0101, as the daughter of Time, is known as a most unfortunate daughter. She was, however, at one time accepted by a great king, Yay\u0101ti. Yay\u0101ti was cursed by his father-in-law, \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, to accept her. When \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s daughter was married to King Yay\u0101ti, one of her friends named \u015aarmi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 went with her.

Consequently, \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya cursed King Yay\u0101ti to become prematurely old. King Yay\u0101ti had five youthful sons, and he begged all his sons to exchange their youth for his old age. No one agreed except the youngest son, whose name was P\u016bru. Upon accepting Yay\u0101ti\u2019s old age, P\u016bru was given the kingdom. It is said that two of Yay\u0101ti\u2019s other sons, being disobedient to their father, were given kingdoms outside of India, most probably Turkey and Greece. The purport is that one can accumulate wealth and all kinds of material opulences but during old age one cannot enjoy them. Although P\u016bru attained his father\u2019s kingdom, he could not enjoy all the opulence, for he had sacrificed his youth. One should not wait for old age in order to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Due to the invalidity of old age, one cannot make progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however opulent he may be materially."

One who does not actually follow the hygienic principles prescribed in the Vedic rules and regulations will be subjected to many contagious diseases. Because the students in this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement are advised to follow the Vedic principles, they naturally become hygienic. If a person is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he can work like a young man even if he is seventy-five or eighty years old. Thus the daughter of K\u0101la (Time) cannot overcome a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. \u015ar\u012bla K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja Gosv\u0101m\u012b engaged in writing Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta when he was very old, yet he presented the most wonderful literature about the activities of Lord Caitanya. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b began their spiritual lives at a very old age \u2014 that is, after they retired from their occupations and family lives \u2014 yet they presented many valuable literatures for the advancement of spiritual life. This is confirmed by \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bniv\u0101sa \u0100c\u0101rya, who praised the Gosv\u0101m\u012bs in this way: \u201cI offer my respectful obeisances unto the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, namely \u015ar\u012b San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u015ar\u012b Raghun\u0101tha Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u015ar\u012b Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u015ar\u012b J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and \u015ar\u012b Gop\u0101la Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who are very expert in scrutinizingly studying all the revealed scriptures with the aim of establishing eternal religious principles for the benefit of all human beings. Thus they are honored all over the three worlds, and they are worth taking shelter of because they are absorbed in the mood of the gop\u012bs and are engaged in the transcendental loving service of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Thus jar\u0101, the effect of old age, does not harass a devotee. This is because a devotee follows the instructions and the determination of N\u0101rada Muni. All devotees are in the disciplic succession stemming from N\u0101rada Muni because they worship the Deity according to N\u0101rada Muni\u2019s direction, namely the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, or the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi. A devotee follows the principles of p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi as well as bh\u0101gavata-vidhi. Bh\u0101gavata-vidhi includes preaching work \u2014 \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 \u2014 the hearing and chanting of the glories of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi includes arcana\u1e41 vandana\u1e41 d\u0101sya\u1e41 sakhyam \u0101tma-nivedanam. Because a devotee rigidly follows the instructions of N\u0101rada Muni, he has no fear of old age, disease or death. Apparently a devotee may grow old, but he is not subjected to the symptoms of defeat experienced by a common man in old age. Consequently, old age does not make a devotee fearful of death, as a common man is fearful of death. When jar\u0101, or old age, takes shelter of a devotee, K\u0101lakany\u0101 diminishes the devotee\u2019s fear. A devotee knows that after death he is going back home, back to Godhead; therefore he has no fear of death. Thus instead of depressing a devotee, advanced age helps him become fearless and thus happy."

Since K\u0101lakany\u0101, the daughter of Time, was deputed by N\u0101rada Muni to offer herself to Yavana-r\u0101ja, the King of the Yavanas could not refuse her. All transactions must be performed in light of the \u015b\u0101stric injunctions. The \u015b\u0101stric injunctions are confirmed by great sages like N\u0101rada Muni.

Those who are insane simply do not care for death, nor do they know what is going to happen after death.

Everyone can experience that although we try to keep the body in a comfortable position, it is always giving pain and is subjected to the threefold miseries. Otherwise, why are there so many hospitals, welfare boards and insurance establishments? Actually, in this world there is no happiness. People are simply engaged trying to counteract unhappiness. Foolish people accept unhappiness as happiness; therefore the King of the Yavanas decided to attack such foolish people imperceptibly by old age, disease, and ultimately death. Of course, after death there must be birth; therefore Yavana-r\u0101ja thought it wise to kill all the karm\u012bs through the agency of K\u0101lakany\u0101 and thus try to make them aware that materialistic advancement is not actually advancement. Every living entity is a spiritual being, and consequently without spiritual advancement the human form of life is ruined."

        "translation": "The King of the Yavanas continued: Here is my brother Prajv\u0101ra. I now accept you as my sister. I shall employ both of you, as well as my dangerous soldiers, to act imperceptibly within this world.",
        "purport": " K\u0101lakany\u0101 was sent by N\u0101rada Muni to Yavana-r\u0101ja so that she might become his wife, but instead of accepting her as his wife, Yavana-r\u0101ja accepted her as his sister. Those who do not follow the Vedic principles are unrestricted as far as sex life is concerned. Consequently they sometimes do not hesitate to have sex with their sisters. In this Age of Kali there are many instances of such incest. Although Yavana-r\u0101ja accepted the request of N\u0101rada Muni to show respect to him, he was nonetheless thinking of illicit sex. This was due to his being the King of the yavanas and mlecchas. The word prajv\u0101ra\u1e25 is very significant, for it means \u201cthe fever sent by Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\u201d Such a fever is always set at 107 degrees, the temperature at which a man dies. Thus the King of the mlecchas and yavanas requested the daughter of Time, K\u0101lakany\u0101, to become his sister. There was no need to ask her to become his wife, for the yavanas and mlecchas do not make distinctions as far as sex life is concerned. Thus one may outwardly be a sister, mother or daughter and still have sex. Yavana-r\u0101ja\u2019s brother was Prajv\u0101ra, and K\u0101lakany\u0101 was invalidity itself. Combined and strengthened by the soldiers of Yavana-r\u0101ja \u2014 namely nonhygienic conditions, illicit sex and ultimately a high degree of temperature to bring on death \u2014 they would be able to smash the materialistic way of life. In this connection it is significant that N\u0101rada was immune to the attack of jar\u0101, or invalidity. Similarly jar\u0101, or the destructive force, cannot attack any follower of N\u0101rada Muni or another pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava."
