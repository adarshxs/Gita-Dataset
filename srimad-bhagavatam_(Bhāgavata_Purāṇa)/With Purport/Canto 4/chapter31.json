The home is considered to be a dark well covered by grass, and if one falls within this well, he simply dies without anyone\u2019s caring. One should therefore not be too much attached to family life, for it will spoil one\u2019s development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " In this verse the words pare amale are significant. The realization of Brahman is explained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases: impersonal effulgence (Brahman), localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagav\u0101n. In his prayers, Lord \u015aiva concentrated upon the personal features of Parabrahman, described in personal terms as snigdha-pr\u0101v\u1e5b\u1e0d-ghana-\u015by\u0101mam (Bh\u0101g. 4.24.45). Following the instructions of Lord \u015aiva, the Pracet\u0101s also concentrated their minds on the \u015ay\u0101masundara form of the Supreme Brahman. Although impersonal Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 Brahman and Brahman as the Supreme Person are all on the same transcendental platform, the personal feature of the Supreme Brahman is the ultimate goal and last word in transcendence. The great sage N\u0101rada travels everywhere. He goes to the demons and the demigods and is equally respected. He is consequently described herein as sur\u0101sure\u1e0dya, worshiped both by demons and by demigods. For N\u0101rada Muni, the door of every house is open. Although there is perpetual animosity between the demons and demigods, N\u0101rada Muni is welcomed everywhere. N\u0101rada is considered one of the demigods, of course, and the word devar\u1e63i means \u201cthe saintly person among the demigods.\u201d But not even the demons envy N\u0101rada Muni; therefore he is equally worshiped both by demons and by demigods. A perfect Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u2019s position should be just like N\u0101rada Muni\u2019s, completely independent and unbiased."

By chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra regularly and following the regulative principles, one becomes qualified to be initiated as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, because unless one is a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a he cannot be allowed to worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This is called y\u0101j\u00f1ika-janma. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness society, unless one is twice initiated \u2014 first by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and second by the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra \u2014 he is not allowed to enter the kitchen or Deity room to execute duties. However, when one is elevated to the platform on which he can worship the Deity, his previous birth does not matter:"

Before the birth takes place, or before father and mother unite, there is a ceremony called garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, which must be adopted. This garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra is especially recommended for higher castes, especially the br\u0101hma\u1e47a caste.

By chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra regularly and following the regulative principles, one becomes qualified to be initiated as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, because unless one is a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a he cannot be allowed to worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

However, a human being can be reformed from the \u015baukra-janma, as recommended in the Vedic civilization. Before the birth takes place, or before father and mother unite, there is a ceremony called garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, which must be adopted. This garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra is especially recommended for higher castes, especially the br\u0101hma\u1e47a caste. It is said in the \u015b\u0101stras that if the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra is not practiced among the higher castes, the entire family becomes \u015b\u016bdra. It is also stated that in this Age of Kali, everyone is \u015b\u016bdra due to the absence of the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. This is the Vedic system. According to the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika system, however, even though everyone is a \u015b\u016bdra due to the absence of the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, if a person has but a little tendency to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he should be given the chance to elevate himself to the transcendental platform of devotional service. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement adopts this p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi, as advised by \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who says: \u201cAs bell metal, when mixed with mercury, is transformed to gold, a person, even though not golden pure, can be transformed into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or dvija, simply by the initiation process.\u201d (Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa 2.12) Thus if one is initiated by a proper person, he can be accepted as twice-born immediately. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, we therefore offer the student his first initiation and allow him to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. By chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra regularly and following the regulative principles, one becomes qualified to be initiated as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, because unless one is a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a he cannot be allowed to worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This is called y\u0101j\u00f1ika-janma. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness society, unless one is twice initiated \u2014 first by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and second by the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra \u2014 he is not allowed to enter the kitchen or Deity room to execute duties. However, when one is elevated to the platform on which he can worship the Deity, his previous birth does not matter: \u201cEven if one is born in the family of a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la, if one engages in the devotional service of the Lord, he becomes the best of br\u0101hma\u1e47as. But even a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who is devoid of devotional service is on the level of the lowest dog-eater.\u201d If a person is advanced in devotional service, it does not matter whether he was born in a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la family. He becomes purified. As \u015ar\u012b Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said: Even if one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and is qualified with all the brahminical qualifications, he is considered degraded if he is averse to worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

As far as our senses are concerned, there are many animals, both beasts and birds, who are very expert in exercising their senses more keenly than human beings. For example, vultures and hawks can go very high in the sky but can see a small body on the ground very clearly. This means that their eyesight is so keen that they can find an eatable corpse from a great distance. Certainly their eyesight is much keener than human beings\u2019, but this does not mean that their existence is more important than that of a human being. Similarly, dogs can smell many things from a far distance. Many fish can understand by the power of sound that an enemy is coming. All these examples are described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. If one\u2019s senses cannot help him attain the highest perfection of life \u2014 realization of the Supreme \u2014 they are all useless."

These are beneficial only insofar as they are complementary to devotional service. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore told San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b that without a touch of devotional service j\u00f1\u0101na, yoga and S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy cannot give one the desired results. The impersonalists wish to merge into the Supreme Brahman; however, merging into the Supreme Brahman also requires a touch of devotional service. The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases: impersonal Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All these require a touch of devotional service. Sometimes it is actually seen that these M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs also chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, although their motive is to merge into the Brahman effulgence of the Absolute. The yog\u012bs also at times take to chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, but their purpose is different from that of the bhaktas. In all processes \u2014 karma, j\u00f1\u0101na or yoga \u2014 bhakti is required. That is the purport of this verse."

        "translation": "As pouring water on the root of a tree energizes the trunk, branches, twigs and everything else, and as supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, simply worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead through devotional service automatically satisfies the demigods, who are parts of that Supreme Personality.",
        "purport": " Sometimes people ask why this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement simply advocates worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to the exclusion of the demigods. The answer is given in this verse. The example of pouring water on the root of a tree is very appropriate. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.1) it is said, \u016brdhva-m\u016blam adha\u1e25-\u015b\u0101kham: this cosmic manifestation has expanded downward, and the root is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord confirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8), aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25: \u201cI am the source of all spiritual and material worlds.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the root of everything; therefore rendering service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sev\u0101), means automatically serving all the demigods. Sometimes it is argued that karma and j\u00f1\u0101na require a mixture of bhakti in order to be successfully executed, and sometimes it is argued that bhakti also requires karma and j\u00f1\u0101na for its successful termination. The fact is, however, that although karma and j\u00f1\u0101na cannot be successful without bhakti, bhakti does not require the help of karma and j\u00f1\u0101na. Actually, as described by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam: pure devotional service should not be contaminated by the touch of karma and j\u00f1\u0101na. Modern society is involved in various types of philanthropic works, humanitarian works and so on, but people do not know that these activities will never be successful unless K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is brought into the center. One may ask what harm there is in worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the different parts of His body, the demigods, and the answer is also given in this verse. The point is that by supplying food to the stomach, the indriyas, the senses, are automatically satisfied. If one tries to feed his eyes or ears independently, the result is only havoc. Simply by supplying food to the stomach, we satisfy all of the senses. It is neither necessary nor feasible to render separate service to the individual senses. The conclusion is that by serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sev\u0101), everything is complete. As confirmed in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.62), k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e bhakti kaile sarva-karma k\u1e5bta haya: if one is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything is automatically accomplished."

Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.1) confirms: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is known as Govinda, is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, and He is the prime cause of all causes.\u201d Although He is the supreme cause, the cause of all causes, He is still parama, transcendental, and His form is sac-cid-\u0101nanda, eternal, spiritual bliss. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the shelter of everything, and this is the verdict of all scripture. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the remote cause, and material nature is the immediate cause of the cosmic manifestation. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that understanding prak\u1e5bti, or nature, to be the cause of everything is like understanding the nipples on the neck of a goat to be the cause of milk. Material nature is the immediate cause of the cosmic manifestation, but the original cause is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sometimes people think that the cause of an earthen pot is the earth. We see on a potter\u2019s wheel a sufficient amount of earth to produce many pots, and although unintelligent men will say that the earth on the wheel is the cause of the pot, those who are actually advanced will find that the original cause is the potter, who supplies the earth and moves the wheel. Material nature may be a helping factor in the creation of this cosmic manifestation, but it is not the ultimate cause. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10) the Lord therefore says:"

In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that understanding prak\u1e5bti, or nature, to be the cause of everything is like understanding the nipples on the neck of a goat to be the cause of milk.

Material nature may be a helping factor in the creation of this cosmic manifestation, but it is not the ultimate cause. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10) the Lord therefore says: \u201cThis material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt\u012b, and producing all moving and unmoving beings.\u201d"

Since He is aloof from the material emanations, He is free from their interactions and is Lord of material nature. You should therefore engage in His devotional service, thinking yourself qualitatively one with Him.",
        "purport": " According to Vedic calculations, there are three causes of creation: time, the ingredient and the creator. Combined, these are called tritay\u0101tmaka, the three causes. Everything in this material world is created by these three causes. All of these causes are found in the Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am. N\u0101rada Muni therefore advises the Pracet\u0101s to worship the direct cause, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated before, when the root of a tree is watered, all the parts are energized. According to the advice of N\u0101rada Muni, one should directly engage in devotional service. This will include all pious activity. Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta states, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e bhakti kaile sarva-karma k\u1e5bta haya: when one worships the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in devotional service, one automatically performs all other pious activity. In this verse the words sva-tejas\u0101 dhvasta-gu\u1e47a-prav\u0101ham are very significant. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is never affected by the material qualities, although they all emanate from His spiritual energy. Those who are really conversant with this knowledge can utilize everything for the service of the Lord because nothing in this material world is unconnected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

The first item mentioned is dayay\u0101 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u, showing mercy to all conditioned souls. The best way to show mercy is to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The entire world is suffering for want of this knowledge. People should know that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original cause of everything. Knowing this, everyone should directly engage in His devotional service. Those who are actually learned, advanced in spiritual understanding, should preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world so that people may take to it and make their lives successful. The word sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u is significant because it applies not only to human beings but to all the living entities appearing in the 8,400,000 species of life. The devotee can do good not only to humanity but to all living entities as well. Everyone can benefit spiritually by the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. When the transcendental vibration of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sounded, even the trees, animals and insects benefit. Thus when one chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra loudly, he actually shows mercy to all living entities. To spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement throughout the world, the devotees should be satisfied in all conditions: It does not matter to the pure devotee if he has to go to hell to preach. The Supreme Lord lives in the heart of a hog, although the Lord is in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Even while preaching in hell, a pure devotee remains a pure devotee by his constant association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To attain this state, one has to control his senses. The senses are automatically controlled when one\u2019s mind is engaged in the service of the Lord."

Thus they can always think of the Lord constantly and address Him very feelingly. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, knowing Himself to be controlled by His devotees, does not leave them for a second, just as the sky overhead never becomes invisible.",
        "purport": " It is clear from the previous verse that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Jan\u0101rdana, is very quickly satisfied by the activities of His devotees. The pure devotee is always absorbed in the thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated, \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. By always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the pure devotee\u2019s heart is freed from all kinds of desires. In the material world, the heart of the living entity is filled with material desires. When the living entity is cleansed, he does not think of anything material. As the mind is completely cleansed, one attains the perfectional stage of mystic yoga, for then the yog\u012b always sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart (dhyan\u0101vasthita-tad-gatena manas\u0101 pa\u015byanti ya\u1e41 yogina\u1e25). As soon as the Lord is seated within the heart of the devotee, the devotee cannot be contaminated by the material modes of nature. As long as one is under the control of the material modes, he desires so many things and makes so many plans for material sense enjoyment, but as soon as the Lord is perceived in the heart, all material desires vanish. When the mind is completely free from material desire, the devotee can think of the Lord constantly. In this way he becomes completely dependent upon the lotus feet of the Lord. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu prays: \u201cMy dear Lord, I am Your eternal servant, but somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of this material world. Kindly pick me up and fix me as a speck of dust at Your lotus feet.\u201d (\u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka 5) Similarly, \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura prays: \u201cMy dear Lord, You are now present with the daughter of King V\u1e5b\u1e63abh\u0101nu, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. Now both of You please be merciful upon me. Don\u2019t kick me away, because I have no shelter other than You.\u201d In this way the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes dependent on His devotee. The Lord is invincible, yet He is conquered by His pure devotee. He enjoys being dependent on His devotee, just as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enjoyed being dependent on the mercy of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. Thinking Himself dependent on the devotee gives the Supreme Lord great enjoyment. Sometimes a king may engage a joker, and in the process of joking the king is sometimes insulted. The king, however, enjoys these activities. Everyone worships the Supreme Lord with great reverence; therefore the Lord sometimes wants to enjoy the chastisement of His devotees. In this way the relationship eternally existing between the Lord and His devotees is fixed, just like the sky overhead."

        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is dependent on His pure devotees. He does not even accept the offerings of those who are not devotees. A pure devotee is one who feels He does not possess anything material. A devotee is always happy in possessing the devotional service of the Lord. Devotees may sometimes appear materially poor, but because they are spiritually advanced and enriched, they are most dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such devotees are free from attachment to family, society, friendship, children and so on. They abandon affection for all these material possessions and are always happy in possessing the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead understands the position of His devotee. If a person derides a pure devotee, he is never recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, the Supreme Lord never excuses one who offends a pure devotee. There are many examples of this in history. A great mystic yog\u012b, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, offended the great devotee Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. The great sage Durv\u0101s\u0101 was to be chastised by the Sudar\u015bana cakra of the Lord. Even though the great mystic directly approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was never excused. Those on the path of liberation should be very careful not to offend a pure devotee."

Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 says that the Lord is worshiped by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune, but the Supreme Lord does not require service from any of them because if He so desires He can produce millions of goddesses of fortune through His spiritual energy, the pleasure potency. This very Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless mercy, becomes dependent on the devotees. How fortunate, then, is a devotee who is thus favored by the Personality of Godhead. What ungrateful devotee will not worship the Lord and enter into His devotional service? Actually, a devotee cannot forget his obligation to the Supreme Personality of Godhead even for a single moment. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that both the Supreme Lord and His devotee are rasa-j\u00f1a, full of transcendental humor.

There are eight types of transcendental ecstasy (known as bh\u0101va, anubh\u0101va, sth\u0101yi-bh\u0101va and so on), and these are discussed in The Nectar of Devotion. Those who are unaware of the position of the living entity and the Supreme Person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, think that the mutual attachment between the Lord and His devotees is a creation of the material energy.

        "purport": " When a saintly person wants to see his kinsmen, he has no material desire to see them. He simply wants to give them some instructions so that they can benefit. Vidura belonged to the royal family of the Kauravas, and although he knew that all the family members were destroyed at the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, he nonetheless wanted to see his elder brother, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, to see if he could deliver Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. When a great saintly person like Vidura sees his relatives, he desires only to deliver them from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. Vidura thus offered his respectful obeisances to his spiritual master and departed for the city of Hastin\u0101pura, the kingdom of the Kauravas."
