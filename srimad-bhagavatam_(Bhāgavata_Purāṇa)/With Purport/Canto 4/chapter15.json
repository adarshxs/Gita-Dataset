Nowadays it has become a cheap fashion to accept any rascal as an incarnation of God, but from this incident we can see that Lord Brahm\u0101 personally examined the hands and feet of King P\u1e5bthu for specific signs. In their prophecies the learned sages and br\u0101hma\u1e47as accepted P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja as a plenary partial expansion of the Lord. During the presence of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, a king declared himself V\u0101sudeva, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a killed him. Before accepting someone as an incarnation of God, one should verify his identity according to the symptoms mentioned in the \u015b\u0101stras. Without these symptoms the pretender is subject to be killed by the authorities for pretending to be an incarnation of God."

Because the qualities were not yet manifest, however, King P\u1e5bthu very humbly asked why the devotees should praise him with such exalted words. He did not want anyone to offer him prayers or glorify him unless he possessed the real qualities of which they spoke. The offering of prayers was certainly appropriate, for he was an incarnation of Godhead, but he warned that one should not be accepted as an incarnation of the Personality of Godhead without having the godly qualities. At the present moment there are many so-called incarnations of the Personality of Godhead, but these are merely fools and rascals whom people accept as incarnations of God although they have no godly qualities. King P\u1e5bthu desired that his real characteristics in the future might justify such words of praise. Although there was no fault in the prayers offered, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja indicated that such prayers should not be offered to an unfit person who pretends to be an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

This is the difference between a devotee and a demon. Demons manufacture their own gods, or a demon himself claims to be God, following in the footsteps of R\u0101va\u1e47a and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. Although P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was factually an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he rejected those praises because the qualities of the Supreme Person were not yet manifest in him. He wanted to stress that one who does not actually possess these qualities should not try to engage his followers and devotees in offering him glory for them, even though these qualities might be manifest in the future. If a man who does not factually possess the attributes of a great personality engages his followers in praising him with the expectation that such attributes will develop in the future, that sort of praise is actually an insult."
