        "translation": "At the last stage of his life, when Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu saw himself getting old, that great soul, who was king of the world, divided whatever opulence he had accumulated amongst all kinds of living entities, moving and nonmoving. He arranged pensions for everyone according to religious principles, and after executing the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in complete coordination with Him, he dedicated his sons unto the earth, which was considered to be his daughter. Then Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu left the presence of his citizens, who were almost lamenting and crying from feeling separation from the King, and went to the forest alone with his wife to perform austerities.",
        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was one of the \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such he appeared on the surface of the earth to execute the orders of the Supreme. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all planets, and He is always anxious to see that in each and every planet the living entities are happily living and executing their duties. As soon as there is some discrepancy in the execution of duties, the Lord appears on earth, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.7): yad\u0101 yad\u0101 hi dharmasya gl\u0101nir bhavati bh\u0101rata. Since there were so many discrepancies during the reign of King Vena, the Lord sent His most confidential devotee Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu to settle things. Therefore, after executing the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and settling the affairs of the world, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was ready to retire. He had been exemplary in his governmental administration, and now he was to become exemplary in his retirement. He divided all his property amongst his sons and appointed them to rule the world, and then he went to the forest with his wife. It is significant in this connection that it is said that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu retired alone and at the same time took his wife with him. According to Vedic principles, when retiring from family life one can take his wife with him, for the husband and wife are considered to be one unit. Thus they can both combinedly perform austerities for liberation. This is the path that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, who was an exemplary character, followed, and this is also the way of Vedic civilization. One should not simply remain at home until the time of death, but should separate from family life at a timely moment and prepare himself to go back to Godhead. As a \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba incarnation of God who had actually come from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha as a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was certain to go back to Godhead. Nonetheless, in order to set the example in all ways, he also underwent severe austerities in the tapo-vana. It appears that in those days there were many tapo-vanas, or forests especially meant for retirement and the practice of austerities. Indeed, it was compulsory for everyone to go to the tapo-vana to fully accept the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for it is very difficult to retire from family life and at the same time remain at home."

He engaged in these activities as seriously as he had formerly engaged in leading the government and conquering everyone.",
        "purport": " As it is necessary for one to become very active in family life, similarly, after retirement from family life, it is necessary to control the mind and senses. This is possible when one engages himself fully in the devotional service of the Lord. Actually the whole purpose of the Vedic system, the Vedic social order, is to enable one to ultimately return home, back to Godhead. The g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama is a sort of concession combining sense gratification with a regulative life. It is to enable one to easily retire in the middle of life and engage fully in austerities in order to transcend material sense gratification once and for all. Therefore in the v\u0101naprastha stage of life, tapasya, or austerity, is strongly recommended. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu followed exactly all the rules of v\u0101naprastha life, which is technically known as vaikh\u0101nasa-\u0101\u015brama. The word vaikh\u0101nasa-susammate is significant because in v\u0101naprastha life the regulative principles are also to be strictly followed. In other words, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was an ideal character in every sphere of life. Mah\u0101jano yena gata\u1e25 sa panth\u0101\u1e25: one should follow in the footsteps of great personalities. Thus by following the exemplary character of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, one can become perfect in all respects while living this life or while retiring from active life. Thus after giving up this body, one can become liberated and go back to Godhead."

        "translation": "In the tapo-vana, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu sometimes ate the trunks and roots of trees, sometimes he ate fruit and dried leaves, and for some weeks he drank only water. Finally he lived simply by breathing air.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, yog\u012bs are advised to go to a secluded place in the forest and live alone in a sanctified spot there. By P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s behavior we can understand that when he went to the forest he did not eat any cooked food sent from the city by some devotees or disciples. As soon as one takes a vow to live in the forest, he must simply eat roots, tree trunks, fruits, dried leaves or whatever nature provides in that way. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja strictly adopted these principles for living in the forest, and sometimes he ate nothing but dried leaves and drank nothing but a little water. Sometimes he lived on nothing but air, and sometimes he ate some fruit from the trees. In this way he lived in the forest and underwent severe austerity, especially in regards to eating. In other words, overeating is not at all recommended for one who wants to progress in spiritual life. \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b also warns that too much eating and too much endeavor (aty\u0101h\u0101ra\u1e25 pray\u0101sa\u015b ca) are against the principles by which one can advance in spiritual life. It is also notable that, according to Vedic injunction, to live in the forest is to live in the mode of complete goodness, whereas to live in the city is to live in the mode of passion, and to live in a brothel or drinking house is to live in the mode of ignorance. However, to live in a temple is to live in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, which is transcendental to all the modes of material nature. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement affords one the opportunity to live in the temple of the Lord, which is as good as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Consequently, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not need to go to the forest and artificially try to imitate Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu or the great sages and munis who used to live in the forest. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, after retiring from his minister\u2019s seat in the government, went to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and lived beneath a tree, like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu. Since then, many people have gone to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to imitate R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s behavior. Instead of advancing in spiritual life, many have fallen into material habits and even in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana have become victims of illicit sex, gambling and intoxication. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has been introduced in the Western countries, but it is not possible for Westerners to go to the forest and practice the severe austerities which were ideally practiced by P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja or R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b. However, Westerners or anyone else can follow in the footsteps of \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura by living in a temple, which is transcendental to residence in a forest, and to vow to accept k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101da and nothing else, follow the regulative principles and chant sixteen rounds daily of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. In this way, one\u2019s spiritual life will never be disturbed."

One is enjoined to sit within a circle of fire, with flames blazing from four sides and the sun blazing directly overhead. This is one kind of pa\u00f1ca-tap\u0101\u1e25 recommended for austerity. Similarly, in the rainy season one is enjoined to expose himself to torrents of rain, and in winter to sit in cold water up to the neck. As far as bedding is concerned, the ascetic should be content with simply lying on the floor. The purpose for undergoing such severe austerities is to become a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as explained in the next verse."

All this he did for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He had no other purpose.",
        "purport": " In Kali-yuga the following is recommended: In order to be recognized by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should chant the holy name of the Lord continuously, twenty-four hours a day. Unfortunate persons who cannot accept this formula prefer to execute some type of pseudomeditation, without accepting the other processes of austerity. The fact is, however, that one must accept either the severe method of austerity described above to become purified or take to the process of devotional service recommended for pleasing the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The person who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is most intelligent because in Kali-yuga it is not at all possible to undergo such severe austerities. We need only follow great personalities like Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. In His \u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka, Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu wrote, para\u1e41 vijayate \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtanam: all glories to the holy names of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which from the very beginning purify the heart and immediately liberate one. Bhava-mah\u0101d\u0101v\u0101gni-nirv\u0101panam. If the real purpose of all yoga is to please Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then this simple bhakti-yoga system recommended for this age is sufficient. It is necessary, however, to engage constantly in the service of the Lord. Although P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja executed his austerities long before the appearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on this planet, his purpose was still to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are many fools who claim that worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a began only about five thousand years ago, after the appearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in India, but this is not a fact. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja worshiped K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a millions of years ago, for P\u1e5bthu happened to be a descendant of the family of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva, who reigned for thirty-six thousand years during the Satya-yuga age. Unless his total life span was one hundred thousand years, how could Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja reign over the world for thirty-six thousand years? The point is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a worship existed at the beginning of creation and has continued to exist throughout Satya-yuga, Tret\u0101-yuga and Dv\u0101para-yuga, and now it is continuing in Kali-yuga. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears not only in this millennium of Brahm\u0101\u2019s life, but in every millennium. Therefore worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is conducted in all millenniums. It is not that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a worship began only when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared on this planet five thousand years ago. This is a foolish conclusion that is not substantiated by Vedic literatures. Also of significance in this verse are the words \u0101rir\u0101dhayi\u1e63u\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47am acarat tapa uttamam: Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu underwent severe types of austerities for the express purpose of worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind, especially in this age, that He appears in the transcendental vibration of His holy name. As is said in the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, \u0101r\u0101dhito yadi haris tapas\u0101 tata\u1e25 kim: if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshiped, if He is the goal of advancement, there is no need for one to execute severe types of tapasya, because one has already reached his destination. If, after executing all types of tapasya, one cannot reach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all his tapasya has no value, for without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a all austerity is simply wasted labor, \u015brama eva hi kevalam (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.8). We should therefore not be discouraged just because we cannot go to the forest and practice severe austerities. Our life is so short that we must strictly adhere to the principles laid down by the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas and peacefully execute K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There is no need to become despondent. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura recommends, \u0101nande bala hari, bhaja v\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, \u015bri-guru-vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-pade maj\u0101iy\u0101 mana: for a transcendental, blissful life, chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, come worship the holy place of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and always engage in the service of the Lord, of the spiritual master and of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore very safe and easy. We have only to execute the order of the Lord and fully surrender unto Him. We have only to execute the order of the spiritual master, preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and follow in the path of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. The spiritual master represents both Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas; therefore by following the instructions of the spiritual master and by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, everything will be all right."

He also practiced breathing exercises to control his mind and senses, and by such control he became completely free from all desires for fruitive activity.",
        "purport": " The word pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101mai\u1e25 is very important in this verse because the ha\u1e6dha-yog\u012bs and a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yog\u012bs practice pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma but generally do not know the purpose behind it. The purpose of pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, or mystic yoga, is to stop the mind and senses from engaging in fruitive activities. The so-called yog\u012bs who practice in Western countries have no idea of this. The aim of pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma is not to make the body strong and fit for working hard. The aim is worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the previous verse it was specifically mentioned that whatever austerity, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma and mystic yoga practices P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja performed were performed for the sake of worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja serves as a perfect example for yog\u012bs also. Whatever he did, he did to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The minds of those who are addicted to fruitive activity are always filled with unclean desires. Fruitive activities are symptomatic of our polluted desire to dominate material nature. As long as one continues to be subject to polluted desires, he has to accept one material body after another. So-called yog\u012bs, without knowledge of the real purpose of yoga, practice it in order to keep the body fit. Thus they engage themselves in fruitive activities, and thus they are bound by desire to accept another body. They are not aware that the ultimate goal of life is to approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In order to save such yog\u012bs from wandering throughout the different species of life, the \u015b\u0101stras warn that in this age such yogic practice is simply a waste of time. The only means of elevation is the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. King P\u1e5bthu\u2019s activities took place in Satya-yuga, and in this age this practice of yoga is misunderstood by fallen souls who are not capable of practicing anything. Consequently the \u015b\u0101stras enjoin, kalau n\u0101sty eva n\u0101sty eva n\u0101sty eva gatir anyath\u0101. The conclusion is that unless the karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs come to the point of devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, their so-called austerities and yoga have no value. N\u0101r\u0101dhita\u1e25: if Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is not worshiped, there is no point in practicing meditational yoga, performing karma-yoga or culturing empiric knowledge. As far as pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma is concerned, chanting of the holy name of the Lord and dancing in ecstasy are also considered pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma. In a previous verse, Sanat-kum\u0101ra instructed Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu to engage constantly in the service of the Supreme Lord, V\u0101sudeva: Only by worshiping V\u0101sudeva can one become free from the desires of fruitive activities. Outside of worshiping V\u0101sudeva, the yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs cannot attain freedom from such desires: Here the word pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma does not refer to any ulterior motive. The actual aim is to strengthen the mind and senses in order to engage them in devotional service. In the present age this determination can be very easily acquired simply by chanting the holy names: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."

        "purport": " In this verse it is clearly said that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, practicing the pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma-yoga system, engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as advised by the saint Sanat-kum\u0101ra. In this verse the words puru\u1e63am abhajat puru\u1e63ar\u1e63abha\u1e25 are significant. Puru\u1e63ar\u1e63abha refers to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, the best amongst human beings, and puru\u1e63am refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conclusion is that the best man amongst all men engages in the service of the Supreme Person. One puru\u1e63a is worshipable, and the other puru\u1e63a is the worshiper. When the puru\u1e63a who worships, the living entity, thinks of becoming one with the Supreme Person, he simply becomes bewildered and falls into the darkness of ignorance. As stated by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.12), all living entities assembled in the battlefield, as well as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, were also present in the past as individuals and would continue to be present in the future as individuals also. Therefore the two puru\u1e63as, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, never lose their respective identities. Actually, one who is self-realized engages himself in the service of the Lord perpetually, both in this life and in the next. Indeed, for devotees there is no difference between this life and the next. In this life a neophyte devotee is trained to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in the next life he approaches that Supreme Person in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and renders the same devotional service. Even for the neophyte devotee, devotional service is considered brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate. Devotional service to the Lord is never considered a material activity. Since he is acting on the brahma-bh\u016bta platform, a devotee is already liberated. He therefore has no need to practice any other type of yoga in order to approach the brahma-bh\u016bta stage. If the devotee adheres strictly to the orders of the spiritual master, follows the rules and regulations and chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, it should be concluded that he is already at the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who is engaged in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d"

Thus his love and devotion unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, developed and became unflinching and fixed.",
        "purport": " The word bhagavad-dharmi\u1e47a\u1e25 indicates that the religious process practiced by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was beyond all pretensions. As stated in the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.1.2), dharma\u1e25 projjhita-kaitavo\u00a0\u2019tra: religious principles which are simply pretentious are actually nothing but cheating. Bhagavad-dharmi\u1e47a\u1e25 is described by V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya as niv\u1e5btta-dharme\u1e47a, which indicates that it cannot be contaminated by material aspiration. As described by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: When one who is not inspired by material desires and is not contaminated by the processes of fruitive activity and empiric speculation fully engages in the favorable service of the Lord, his service is called bhagavad-dharma, or pure devotional service. In this verse the word brahma\u1e47i does not refer to the impersonal Brahman. Impersonal Brahman is a subordinate feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and since impersonal Brahman worshipers desire to merge into the Brahman effulgence, they cannot be considered followers of bhagavad-dharma. After being baffled in his material enjoyment, the impersonalist may desire to merge into the existence of the Lord, but a pure devotee of the Lord has no such desire. Therefore a pure devotee is really bhagavad-dharm\u012b. It is clear from this verse that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was never a worshiper of the impersonal Brahman but was at all times a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhagavati brahma\u1e47i refers to one who is engaged in devotional service to the Personality of Godhead. A devotee\u2019s knowledge of the impersonal Brahman is automatically revealed, and he is not interested in merging into the impersonal Brahman. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu\u2019s activities in devotional service enabled him to become fixed and steady in the discharge of devotional activities without having to take recourse to karma, j\u00f1\u0101na or yoga."

        "translation": "By regularly discharging devotional service, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja became transcendental in mind and could therefore constantly think of the lotus feet of the Lord. Because of this, he became completely detached and attained perfect knowledge by which he could transcend all doubt. Thus he was freed from the clutches of false ego and the material conception of life.",
        "purport": " In the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, devotional service to the Lord is likened unto a queen. When a queen gives an audience, many maidservants follow her. The maidservants of devotional service are material opulence, liberation and mystic powers. The karm\u012bs are very much attached to material enjoyment, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are very anxious to become freed from material clutches, and the yog\u012bs are very fond of attaining the eight kinds of mystic perfection. From the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra we understand that if one attains the stage of pure devotional service, he also attains all the opulences derived from fruitive activities, empiric philosophical speculation and mystic yogic practice. \u015ar\u012bla Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore prayed in his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kar\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta: \u201cMy dear Lord, if I have unflinching devotion to You, You become manifest before me personally, and the results of fruitive activity and empiric philosophical speculation \u2014 namely religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation \u2014 become like personal attendants and remain standing before me as if awaiting my order.\u201d The idea here is that the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, by culture of brahma-vidy\u0101, spiritual knowledge, struggle very hard to get out of the clutches of material nature, but a devotee, by dint of his advancement in devotional service, automatically becomes detached from his material body. When the devotee\u2019s spiritual body begins to manifest, he actually enters into his activities in transcendental life. At present we have contacted a material body, material mind and material intelligence, but when we become free from these material conditions, our spiritual body, spiritual mind and spiritual intelligence become manifest. In that transcendental state, a devotee attains all the benefits of karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga. Although he never engages in fruitive activities or empiric speculation to attain mystic powers, automatically mystic powers appear in his service. A devotee does not want any kind of material opulence, but such opulence appears before him automatically. He does not have to endeavor for it. Because of his devotional service, he automatically becomes brahma-bh\u016bta. As stated before, this is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who is engaged in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d Because of his regular discharge of devotional service, a devotee attains the transcendental stage of life. Since his mind is transcendentally situated, he cannot think of anything but the lotus feet of the Lord. This is the meaning of the word sa\u1e41smara\u1e47a-anup\u016brty\u0101. By constantly thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord, the devotee immediately becomes situated in \u015buddha-sattva. \u015auddha-sattva refers to that platform which is above the modes of material nature, including the mode of goodness. In the material world, the mode of goodness is considered to be representative of the highest perfection, but one has to transcend this mode and come to the stage of \u015buddha-sattva, or pure goodness, where the three qualities of material nature cannot act. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura gives the following example: If one has strong digestive power, after eating he automatically lights a fire within his stomach to digest everything and does not need to take medicine to aid his digestion. Similarly, the fire of devotional service is so strong that a devotee does not need to act separately to attain perfect knowledge or detachment from material attractions. A j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b may become detached from material attractions by prolonged discussions on subjects of knowledge and may in this way finally come to the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, but a devotee does not have to undergo so much trouble. By virtue of his devotional service, he attains the brahma-bh\u016bta stage without a doubt. The yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are always doubtful about their constitutional position; therefore they mistakenly think of becoming one with the Supreme. However, a devotee\u2019s relationship with the Supreme becomes manifest beyond all doubt, and he immediately understands that his position is that of eternal servant of the Lord. J\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs without devotion may think themselves liberated, but actually their intelligence is not as pure as that of a devotee. In other words, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs cannot become factually liberated unless they become elevated to the position of devotees: The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs may rise to the highest position, Brahman realization, but because of their lack of devotion unto the lotus feet of the Lord, they again fall down into material nature. Therefore j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga should not be accepted as the real processes for liberation. By discharging devotional service, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu automatically transcended all these positions. Since Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was a \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba incarnation of the Supreme Lord, he did not have to act in any way to attain liberation. He came from the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world, or spiritual sky, in order to execute the will of the Supreme Lord on earth. Consequently he was to return home, back to Godhead, without having to execute j\u00f1\u0101na, yoga or karma. Although P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was eternally a pure devotee of the Lord, he nonetheless adopted the process of devotional service in order to teach the people in general the proper process for executing the duties of life and ultimately returning home, back to Godhead."

Being thus able to get all instructions from Him, he gave up all other practices of yoga and j\u00f1\u0101na. He was not even interested in the perfection of the yoga and j\u00f1\u0101na systems, for he thoroughly realized that devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate goal of life and that unless the yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs become attracted to k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 [narrations about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], their illusions concerning existence can never be dispelled.",
        "purport": " As long as one is too much absorbed in the bodily conception of life, he becomes interested in many different processes of self-realization, such as the mystic yoga system or the system utilizing the speculative empiric methods. However, when one understands that the ultimate goal of life is to approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he realizes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within everyone\u2019s heart and therefore helps everyone who is interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Actually the perfection of life depends on one\u2019s inclination to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is therefore mentioned in this verse, y\u0101vad gad\u0101graja-kath\u0101su rati\u1e41 na kury\u0101t: unless one becomes interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in His pastimes and activities, there is no question of liberation by means of yoga practice or speculative knowledge. Having attained to the stage of devotion, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu became uninterested in the practices of j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga and abandoned them. This is the stage of pure devotional life as described by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: Real j\u00f1\u0101na means understanding that the living entity is the eternal servant of the Lord. This knowledge is attained after many, many births, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19): bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate. In the paramaha\u1e41sa stage of life, one fully realizes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as everything: v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25. When one understands fully that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everything and that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the highest perfection of life, he becomes a paramaha\u1e41sa, or mah\u0101tm\u0101. Such a mah\u0101tm\u0101 or paramaha\u1e41sa is very rare to find. A paramaha\u1e41sa, or pure devotee, is never attracted by ha\u1e6dha-yoga or speculative knowledge. He is simply interested in the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. Sometimes one who was formerly addicted to these processes tries to perform devotional service and the j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga practices at the same time, but as soon as one comes to the unalloyed stage of devotional service, he is able to give up all other methods of self-realization. In other words, when one firmly realizes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme goal, he is no longer attracted by mystic yoga practice or the speculative empirical methods of knowledge."

        "purport": " According to a Bengali proverb, whatever spiritual progress one makes in life will be tested at the time of death. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.6) it is also confirmed: ya\u1e41 ya\u1e41 v\u0101pi smaran bh\u0101va\u1e41 tyajaty ante kalevaram/ ta\u1e41 tam evaiti kaunteya sad\u0101 tad-bh\u0101va-bh\u0101vita\u1e25. Those who are practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness know that their examination will be held at the time of death. If one can remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at death, he is immediately transferred to Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, and thus his life becomes successful. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, could understand that the end of his life was near, and thus he became very jubilant and proceeded to completely give up his body on the brahma-bh\u016bta stage by practicing the yogic process. It is thoroughly described in the following verses how one can voluntarily give up this body and return home, back to Godhead. The yogic process practiced by P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja at the time of death accelerates the giving up of this body while one is in sound health physically and mentally. Every devotee desires to give up the body while it is sound physically and mentally. This desire was also expressed by King Kula\u015bekhara in his Mukunda-m\u0101l\u0101-stotra: King Kula\u015bekhara wanted to give up his body while in a healthy state, and he thus prayed to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to let him die immediately while he was in good health and while his mind was sound. When a man dies, he is generally overpowered by mucus and bile, and thus he chokes. Since it is very difficult to vibrate any sound while choking, it is simply by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grace that one can chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of death. However, by situating oneself in the mukt\u0101sana position, a yog\u012b can immediately give up his body and go to whatever planet he desires. A perfect yog\u012b can give up his body whenever he desires through the practice of yoga."

        "purport": " The sitting posture described herein is called mukt\u0101sana. In the yoga process, after following the strict regulative principles controlling sleeping, eating and mating, one is allowed to practice the different sitting postures. The ultimate aim of yoga is to enable one to give up this body according to his own free will. One who has attained the ultimate summit of yoga practice can live in the body as long as he likes or, as long as he is not completely perfect, leave the body to go anywhere within or outside the universe. Some yog\u012bs leave their bodies to go to the higher planetary systems and enjoy the material facilities therein. However, intelligent yog\u012bs do not wish to waste their time within this material world at all; they do not care for the material facilities in higher planetary systems, but are interested in going directly to the spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. From the description in this verse, it appears that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu had no desire to promote himself to the higher planetary systems. He wanted to return home immediately, back to Godhead. Although Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu stopped all practice of mystic yoga after realizing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he took advantage of his previous practice and immediately placed himself on the brahma-bh\u016bta platform in order to accelerate his return to Godhead. The aim of this particular system of \u0101sana, known as the sitting posture for liberation, or mukt\u0101sana, is to attain success in ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b-cakra and gradually raise the life from the m\u016bl\u0101dh\u0101ra-cakra to the sv\u0101dhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na-cakra, then to the ma\u1e47ip\u016bra-cakra, the an\u0101hata-cakra, the vi\u015buddha-cakra, and finally to the \u0101j\u00f1\u0101-cakra. When the yog\u012b reaches the \u0101j\u00f1\u0101-cakra, between the two eyebrows, he is able to penetrate the brahma-randhra, or the hole in his skull, and go to any planet he desires, up to the spiritual kingdom of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. The conclusion is that one has to come to the brahma-bh\u016bta stage for going back to Godhead. However, those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or who are practicing bhakti-yoga (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam), can return to Godhead without even practicing the mukt\u0101sana process. The purpose of mukt\u0101sana practice is to come to the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, for without being on the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, one cannot be promoted to the spiritual sky. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): The bhakti-yog\u012b, practicing bhakti-yoga, is always situated on the brahma-bh\u016bta stage (brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate). If a devotee is able to continue on the brahma-bh\u016bta platform, he enters the spiritual sky automatically after death and returns to Godhead. Consequently a devotee need not feel sorry for not having practiced the ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b-cakra, or not penetrating the six cakras one after another. As far as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was concerned, he had already practiced this process, and since he did not want to wait for the time when his death would occur naturally, he took advantage of the \u1e63a\u1e6d-cakra penetration process and thus gave up the body according to his own free will and immediately entered the spiritual sky."

Gradually he merged his air of life with the totality of air, his body with the totality of earth, and the fire within his body with the totality of fire.",
        "purport": " When the spiritual spark, which is described as one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, is forced into material existence, that spark is covered by gross and subtle material elements. The material body is composed of five gross elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air and ether \u2014 and three subtle elements \u2014 mind, intelligence and ego. When one attains liberation, he is freed from these material coverings. Indeed, success in yoga involves getting free from these material coverings and entering into spiritual existence. Lord Buddha\u2019s teachings of nirv\u0101\u1e47a are based on this principle. Lord Buddha instructed his followers to give up these material coverings by means of meditation and yoga. Lord Buddha did not give any information about the soul, but if one follows his instructions strictly, he will ultimately become free from the material coverings and attain nirv\u0101\u1e47a. When a living entity gives up the material coverings, he remains a spirit soul. This spirit soul must enter into the spiritual sky to merge into the Brahman effulgence. Unfortunately, unless the living entity has information of the spiritual world and the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas, there is a 99.9 percent chance of his falling down again into material existence. There is, however, a small chance of being promoted to a spiritual planet from the Brahman effulgence, or the brahmajyoti. This brahmajyoti is considered by impersonalists to be without variety, and the Buddhists consider it to be void. In either case, whether one accepts the spiritual sky as being without variety or void, there is none of the spiritual bliss which is enjoyed in the spiritual planets, the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. In the absence of varieties of enjoyment, the spirit soul gradually feels an attraction to enjoy a life of bliss, and not having any information of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka or Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, he naturally falls down to material activities in order to enjoy material varieties."

        "purport": " In respect to the ego, the total material energy is sundered in two parts \u2014 one agitated by the mode of ignorance and the other agitated by the modes of passion and goodness. Due to agitation by the mode of ignorance, the five gross elements are created. Due to agitation by the mode of passion, the mind is created, and due to agitation by the mode of goodness, false egoism, or identification with matter, is created. The mind is protected by a particular type of demigod. Sometimes the mind (mana\u1e25) is also understood to have a controlling deity or demigod. In this way the total mind, namely the material mind controlled by material demigods, was amalgamated with the senses. The senses, in turn, were amalgamated with the sense objects. The sense objects are forms, tastes, smells, sounds, etc. Sound is the ultimate source of the sense objects. The mind was attracted by the senses and the senses by the sense objects, and all of them were ultimately amalgamated in the sky. The creation is so arranged that cause and effect follow one after the other. The merging process involves amalgamating the effect with the original cause. Since the ultimate cause in the material world is mahat-tattva, everything was gradually wound up and amalgamated with the mahat-tattva. This may be compared to \u015b\u016bnya-v\u0101da, or voidism, but this is the process for cleansing the real spiritual mind, or consciousness. When the mind is completely washed of all material contamination, the pure consciousness acts. The sound vibration from the spiritual sky can automatically cleanse all material contaminations, as confirmed by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam. We need only take the advice of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra to cleanse the mind of all material contamination, and this may be considered the summary of this difficult verse. As soon as the whole material contamination is washed away by this process of chanting, all desires and reactions to material activities become immediately vanquished, and real life, peaceful existence, begins. In this Age of Kali it is very difficult to adopt the yogic process mentioned in this verse. Unless one is very expert in such yoga, the best course is to adopt the ways and means of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtanam. Thus one can gloriously become freed from all material contamination by the simple process of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Just as life in this material world has its beginning in material sound, similarly a spiritual life has its beginning in this spiritual sound vibration."

        "translation": "P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja then offered the total designation of the living entity unto the supreme controller of illusory energy. Being released from all the designations by which the living entity became entrapped, he became free by knowledge and renunciation and by the spiritual force of his devotional service. In this way, being situated in his original constitutional position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he gave up this body as a prabhu, or controller of the senses.",
        "purport": " As stated in the Vedas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the source of material energy. Consequently He is sometimes called m\u0101y\u0101-maya, or the Supreme Person, who can create His pastimes through His potency known as the material energy. The j\u012bva, or the individual living entity, becomes entrapped by the material energy by the supreme will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61) we understand: \u012a\u015bvara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is situated within the heart of all conditioned souls, and by His supreme will the living entity, or individual soul, gets the facility to lord it over material nature in various types of bodies, which are known as yantra, or the moving vehicle offered by the total material energy, m\u0101y\u0101. Although the individual living entity (j\u012bva) and the Lord are both situated within the material energy, the Lord is directing the movements of the j\u012bva soul by offering him different types of bodies through the material energy, and thus the living entity is wandering throughout the universes in various forms of body and becomes implicated in different situations, partaking of the reactions of fruitive activities. When P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja became spiritually powerful by the enhancement of his spiritual knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101na) and renunciation of material desires, he became a prabhu, or master of his senses (sometimes called gosv\u0101m\u012b or sv\u0101m\u012b). This means that he was no longer controlled by the influence of material energy. When one is strong enough to give up the influence of material energy, he is called prabhu. In this verse the word svar\u016bpa-stha\u1e25 is also very significant. The real identity of the individual soul lies in understanding or attaining the knowledge that he is eternally a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This understanding is called svar\u016bpopalabdhi. By culturing devotional service, the devotee gradually comes to understand his actual relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This understanding of one\u2019s pure spiritual position is called svar\u016bpopalabdhi, and when one attains that stage he can understand how he is related with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a servant or friend, or as a parent or conjugal lover. This stage of understanding is called svar\u016bpa-stha\u1e25. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja realized this svar\u016bpa completely, and it will be clear in the later verses that he personally left this world, or this body, by riding on a chariot sent from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. In this verse the word prabhu is also significant. As stated before, when one is completely self-realized and acts according to that position, he can be called prabhu. The spiritual master is addressed as Prabhup\u0101da because he is a completely self-realized soul. The word p\u0101da means \u201cposition,\u201d and Prabhup\u0101da indicates that he is given the position of prabhu, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for he acts on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unless one is a prabhu, or controller of the senses, he cannot act as spiritual master, who is authorized by the supreme prabhu, or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In his verses praising the spiritual master, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura writes: \u201cThe spiritual master is honored as much as the Supreme Lord because he is the most confidential servitor of the Lord.\u201d Thus P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja can also be called Prabhup\u0101da or, as described herein, prabhu. Another question may be raised in this connection: Since P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a power incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba-avat\u0101ra, why did he have to execute the regulative principles in order to become a prabhu? Because he appeared on this earth as an ideal king and because it is the duty of the king to instruct the citizens in the execution of devotional service, he followed all the regulative principles of devotional service in order to teach others. Similarly, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, taught us how to approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a devotee. It is said, \u0101pani \u0101cari\u2019 bhakti \u015bikh\u0101inu sab\u0101re. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu instructed others in the process of devotional service by setting the example Himself through His own personal actions. Similarly, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, although a \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba-avat\u0101ra incarnation, still behaved exactly as a devotee in order to achieve the position of prabhu. Furthermore, svar\u016bpa-stha\u1e25 means \u201ccomplete liberation.\u201d As it is said (Bh\u0101g. 2.10.6), hitv\u0101nyath\u0101-r\u016bpa\u1e41 svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25: when a living entity abandons the activities of m\u0101y\u0101 and attains the position from which he can execute devotional service, his state is called svar\u016bpa-stha\u1e25, or complete liberation."

        "translation": "The Queen, the wife of P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, whose name was Arci, followed her husband into the forest. Since she was a queen, her body was very delicate. Although she did not deserve to live in the forest, she voluntarily touched her lotus feet to the ground.",
        "purport": " Because P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s wife was the Queen and also a daughter of a king, she never experienced walking on the ground, for queens used to never come out of the palace. They certainly never went to the forests and tolerated all the difficulties of living in the wilderness. In Vedic civilization there are hundreds of similar examples of such renunciation on the part of queens and dedication to the husband. The goddess of fortune mother S\u012bt\u0101 followed her husband, R\u0101macandra, when He went to the forest. Lord R\u0101macandra went to the forest in compliance with the order of His father, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Da\u015baratha, but mother S\u012bt\u0101 was not so ordered. Nonetheless, she voluntarily accepted the path of her husband. Similarly, G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b, the wife of King Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, also followed her husband into the forest. Being the wives of great personalities like P\u1e5bthu, Lord R\u0101macandra and Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, these were ideal chaste women. Such queens also instructed the general people by showing them how to become a chaste wife and follow the husband in every stage of life. When the husband is king, she sits beside him as the queen, and when he goes to the forest, she also follows, despite having to tolerate all kinds of difficulties in living in the forest. Therefore it is said here (atad-arh\u0101) that although she did not want to touch her feet to the ground, she nonetheless accepted all difficulties when she went to the forest with her husband."

She lay down on the ground and ate only fruits, flowers and leaves, and because she was not fit for these activities, she became frail and thin. Yet because of the pleasure she derived in serving her husband, she did not feel any difficulties.",
        "purport": " The words bhartur vrata-dharma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dhay\u0101 indicate that a woman\u2019s duty, or religious principle, is to serve her husband in all conditions. In Vedic civilization a man is taught from the beginning of his life to become a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, then an ideal g\u1e5bhastha, then v\u0101naprastha, then sanny\u0101s\u012b, and the wife is taught just to follow the husband strictly in all conditions of life. After the period of brahmacarya, a man accepts a householder\u2019s life, and the woman is also taught by her parents to be a chaste wife. Thus when a girl and boy are united, both are trained for a life dedicated to a higher purpose. The boy is trained to execute his duty in accordance with the higher purpose of life, and the girl is trained to follow him. The chaste wife\u2019s duty is to keep her husband pleased in householder life in all respects, and when the husband retires from family life, she is to go to the forest and adopt the life of v\u0101naprastha, or vana-v\u0101s\u012b. At that time the wife is to follow her husband and take care of him, just as she took care of him in householder life. But when the husband takes the renounced order of life, namely sanny\u0101sa, the wife is to return home and become a saintly woman, setting an example for her children and daughters-in-law and showing them how to live a life of austerity. When Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu took sanny\u0101sa, His wife, Vi\u1e63\u1e47upriy\u0101dev\u012b, although only sixteen years old, also took the vow of austerity due to her husband\u2019s leaving home. She chanted her beads, and after finishing one round, she collected one grain of rice. In this way, as many rounds as she chanted, she would receive the same number of rice grains and then cook them and so take pras\u0101da. This is called austerity. Even today in India, widows or women whose husbands have taken sanny\u0101sa follow the principles of austerity, even though they live with their children. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s wife, Arci, was steadily determined to execute the duty of a wife, and while her husband was in the forest, she followed him in eating only fruits and leaves and lying down on the ground. Since a woman\u2019s body is considerably more delicate than a man\u2019s, Queen Arci became very frail and thin, parikar\u015bit\u0101. When one engages in austerities, his body generally becomes lean and thin. Becoming fat is not a very good qualification in spiritual life because a person who is engaged in spiritual life must reduce the comforts of the body \u2014 namely eating, sleeping and mating \u2014 to a minimum. Although Queen Arci became very thin from living in the forest according to regulative principles, she was not unhappy, for she was enjoying the honor of serving her great husband."

As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.13): \u201cAs the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d When a living entity transfers from one body to another, a process generally known as death, a sane man does not lament, for he knows that the living entity is not dead but is simply transferred from one body to another. The Queen should have been afraid of being alone in the forest with the body of her husband, but since she was a great wife of a great personality, she lamented for a while but immediately understood that she had many duties to perform. Thus instead of wasting her time in lamentation, she immediately prepared a fiery pyre on top of a hill and then placed the body of her husband on it to be burned. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu is described here as dayita, for not only was he the king of the earth, but he treated the earth as his protected child. Similarly, he protected his wife also. It was the duty of the king to give protection to everyone, especially to the earth or land which he ruled, as well as the citizens and his family members. Since P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a perfect king, he gave protection to everyone, and therefore he is described here as dayita."

Even after the British period in India this practice was rigidly observed, but soon it degraded to the point that even when the wife was not strong enough to enter the fire of her dead husband, the relatives would force her to enter. Thus this practice had to be stopped, but even today there are still some solitary cases where a wife will voluntarily enter the fire and die with her husband. Even after 1940 we personally knew of a chaste wife who died in this way."

This practice is also followed by the wives of the demigods, and in days past the wives of men also followed this same principle. In Vedic civilization the husband and wife were not separated by such man-made laws as divorce. We should understand the necessity for maintaining family life in human society and should thus abolish this artificial law known as divorce. The husband and wife should live in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and follow in the footsteps of Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-Rukmi\u1e47\u012b.

        "translation": "The wives of the demigods continued: Just see how this chaste lady, Arci, by dint of her inconceivable pious activities, is still following her husband upward, as far as we can see.",
        "purport": " Both P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s airplane and the airplane carrying Queen Arci were passing out of the vision of the ladies of the higher planetary systems. These ladies were simply astonished to see how P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and his wife achieved such an exalted position. Although they were the wives of the denizens of the higher planetary system and P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was an inhabitant of an inferior planetary system (the earth), the King, along with his wife, passed beyond the realms of the demigods and went upward to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. The word \u016brdhvam, \u201cupward,\u201d is significant here, for the ladies speaking were from the higher planetary systems, which include the moon, sun and Venus, up to Brahmaloka, or the highest planet. Beyond Brahmaloka is the spiritual sky, and in that spiritual sky there are innumerable Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas. Thus the word \u016brdhvam indicates that the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are beyond or above these material planets, and it was to these Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets that P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and his wife were going. This also indicates that when P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and his wife, Arci, abandoned their material bodies in the material fire, they immediately developed their spiritual bodies and entered into spiritual airplanes, which could penetrate the material elements and reach the spiritual sky. Since they were carried by two separate airplanes, it may be concluded that even after being burned in the funeral pyre they remained separate, individual persons. In other words, they never lost their identity or became void, as imagined by the impersonalists. The ladies in the higher planetary systems were capable of seeing both downward and upward. When they looked down they could see that the body of P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was being burned and that his wife, Arci, was entering into the fire, and when they looked upward they could see how they were being carried in two airplanes to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas. All of this is possible simply by durvibh\u0101vyena karma\u1e47\u0101, inconceivable activity. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a pure devotee, and his wife, Queen Arci, simply followed her husband. Thus they can both be considered pure devotees, and thus they are capable of performing inconceivable activities. Such activities are not possible for ordinary men. Indeed, ordinary men cannot even take to the devotional service of the Lord, nor can ordinary women maintain such vows of chastity and follow their husbands in all respects. A woman does not need to attain high qualifications, but if she simply follows in the footsteps of her husband, who must be a devotee, then both husband and wife attain liberation and are promoted to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas. This is evinced by the inconceivable activities of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu and his wife."

        "translation": "In this material world, every human being has a short span of life, but those who are engaged in devotional service go back home, back to Godhead, for they are actually on the path of liberation. For such persons, there is nothing which is not available.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.33) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, anityam asukha\u1e41 lokam ima\u1e41 pr\u0101pya bhajasva m\u0101m. The Lord here declares that this material world is full of miseries (asukham) and at the same time is very flickering (anityam). Therefore one\u2019s only duty is to engage himself in devotional service. This is the best end to which human life can be put. Those devotees who are constantly engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord achieve not only all material benefits but also all spiritual benefits, for at the end of life they go back home, back to Godhead. Their destination is described in this verse as bhagavat-padam. The word padam means \u201cabode,\u201d and bhagavat means \u201cthe Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d Thus the destination of the devotees is the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse the word nai\u1e63karmyam, which means \u201ctranscendental knowledge,\u201d is also significant. Unless one comes to the platform of transcendental knowledge and offers devotional service to the Lord, one is not perfect. Generally the processes of j\u00f1\u0101na, yoga and karma are executed life after life before one gets a chance to render pure devotional service to the Lord. This chance is given by the grace of a pure devotee, and it is in this way only that one can actually attain liberation. In the context of this narration, the wives of the demigods repented because although they had the opportunity of a birth in a higher planetary system, a lifetime spanning millions of years and all material comforts, they were not as fortunate as P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and his wife, who were actually surpassing them. In other words, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and his wife scorned promotion to the higher planetary systems and even to Brahmaloka because the position which they were attaining was incomparable. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.16) the Lord affirms, \u0101brahma-bhuvan\u0101l lok\u0101\u1e25 punar \u0101vartino\u00a0\u2019rjuna: \u201cFrom the highest planet in the material world to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place.\u201d In other words, even if one goes to the highest planet, Brahmaloka, he has to return to the miseries of birth and death. In the Ninth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.21), Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also asserts: \u201cWhen they have thus enjoyed heavenly sense pleasure, they return to this mortal planet again.\u201d Thus after exhausting the results of pious activities, one has to come again to the lower planetary systems and begin a new chapter of pious activities. It is therefore said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.12), nai\u1e63karmyam apy acyuta-bh\u0101va-varjitam: \u201cThe path of liberation is not at all secure unless one attains the devotional service of the Lord.\u201d Even if one is promoted to the impersonal brahmajyoti, he runs every chance of falling down into this material world. If it is possible to fall down from the brahmajyoti, which is beyond the higher planetary systems in this material world, then what can be said of the ordinary yog\u012bs and karm\u012bs who can only be elevated to the higher material planets? Thus the wives of the denizens of the higher planetary systems did not very much appreciate the results of karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga."

        "purport": " In this material world people are engaged in different activities simply to achieve a little success in sense gratification. The karm\u012bs are engaged in performing very difficult activities, and thus they open gigantic factories, build huge cities, make big scientific discoveries, etc. In other words, they are engaged in performing very costly sacrifices in order to be promoted to the higher planetary systems. Similarly, yog\u012bs are engaged in achieving a similar goal by accepting the tedious practices of mystic yoga. J\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are engaged in philosophical speculation in order to gain release from the clutches of material nature. In these ways everyone is engaged in performing very difficult tasks simply for the gratification of the senses. All of these are considered to be engaged in sense gratificatory activities (or vi\u1e63aya) because they all demand some facility for material existence. Actually the results of such activities are temporary. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself proclaims in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.23), antavat tu phala\u1e41 te\u1e63\u0101m: \u201cThe fruits [of those who worship the demigods] are limited and temporary.\u201d Thus the fruits of the activities of the yog\u012bs, karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are ephemeral. Moreover, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, tad bhavaty alpa-medhas\u0101m: \u201cThey are simply meant for men of small intelligence.\u201d The word vi\u1e63aya denotes sense gratification. The karm\u012bs flatly state that they want sense gratification. The yog\u012bs also want sense gratification, but they want it to a higher degree. It is their desire to show some miraculous results through the practice of yoga. Thus they strive very hard to achieve success in becoming smaller than the smallest or greater than the greatest, or in creating a planet like earth or, as scientists, by inventing so many wonderful machines. Similarly, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are also engaged in sense gratification, for they are simply interested in becoming one with the Supreme. Thus the aim of all these activities is sense gratification to a higher or a lower degree. The bhaktas, however, are not interested in sense gratificatory practices; they are simply satisfied to get an opportunity to serve the Lord. Although they are satisfied in any condition, there is nothing they cannot obtain, because they are purely engaged in the service of the Lord. The wives of the demigods condemn the performers of sense gratificatory activities as va\u00f1cita, cheated. Those so engaged are actually killing themselves (\u0101tma-h\u0101). As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.20.17): When one wants to cross a large ocean, he requires a strong boat. It is said that this human form of life is a good boat by which one can cross the ocean of nescience. In the human form of life one can obtain the guidance of a good navigator, the spiritual master. One also gets a favorable wind by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that wind is the instructions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The human body is the boat, the instructions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are the favorable winds, and the spiritual master is the navigator. The spiritual master knows well how to adjust the sails to catch the winds favorably and steer the boat to its destination. If, however, one does not take advantage of this opportunity, one wastes the human form of life. Wasting time and life in this way is the same as committing suicide. The word labdhv\u0101pavargyam is significant in this verse, because according to J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u0101pavargyam, or the path of liberation, does not refer to merging into the impersonal Brahman but to s\u0101loky\u0101di-siddhi, which means attaining the very planet where the Supreme Personality of Godhead resides. There are five kinds of liberation, and one is called s\u0101yujya-mukti, or merging into the existence of the Supreme, or the impersonal Brahman effulgence. However, since there is a chance of one\u2019s falling down again into the material sky from the Brahman effulgence, \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b advises that in this human form of life one\u2019s only aim should be to go back home, back to Godhead. The words sa va\u00f1cita\u1e25 indicate that once a person has obtained the human form of life, he is actually cheated if he does not make preparations to go back home, back to Godhead. The position of all nondevotees, who are not interested in going back to Godhead, is very much lamentable, for the human form of life is meant for executing devotional service and nothing else."

        "purport": " According to Vedic scriptures, a woman who dies with her husband, or enters into the fire in which her husband is burning, also enters the same planet her husband attains. In this material world there is a planet known as Patiloka, just as there is a planet known as Pit\u1e5bloka. But in this verse the word pati-loka does not refer to any planet within this material universe, for P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, being topmost amongst self-realized souls, certainly returned home, back to Godhead, and attained one of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Queen Arci also entered Patiloka, but this planet is not in the material universe, for she actually entered the planet which her husband attained. In the material world also, when a woman dies with her husband, she again unites with him in the next birth. Similarly, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu and Queen Arci united in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. In the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets there are husbands and wives, but there is no question of their giving birth to children or having sex life. In the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets both husbands and wives are extraordinarily beautiful, and they are attracted to one another, but they do not enjoy sex life. Indeed, they consider sex not to be very relishable because both husband and wife are always absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and in glorifying and chanting the glories of the Lord. According to Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura also, a husband and wife can turn the home into a place as good as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, even while in this material world. Being absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, even in this world husband and wife can live in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha simply by installing the Deity of the Lord within the home and serving the Deity according to the directions of the \u015b\u0101stras. In this way, they will never feel the sex urge. That is the test of advancement in devotional service. One who is advanced in devotional service is never attracted by sex life, and as soon as one becomes detached from sex life and proportionately attached to the service of the Lord, he actually experiences living in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. In the ultimate issue, there is actually no material world, but when one forgets the service of the Lord and engages himself in the service of his senses, he is said to be living in the material world."

        "purport": " In the execution of devotional service, \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 is especially stressed. This means that bhakti, or devotional service, begins by hearing and chanting about Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. When we speak of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, we also refer to that which relates to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the \u015aiva Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Lord \u015aiva recommends Vi\u1e63\u1e47u worship to be the topmost worship, and that better than Vi\u1e63\u1e47u worship is worship of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava or anything that is related to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The fact is explained herein that hearing and chanting about a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is as good as hearing and chanting about Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, for Maitreya has explained that anyone who hears about P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja with attention also attains the planet which Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu attained. There is no duality between Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, and this is called advaya-j\u00f1\u0101na. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is as important as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and therefore \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura wrote in his Gurv-a\u1e63\u1e6daka: \u201cThe spiritual master is honored as much as the Supreme Lord because he is the most confidential servitor of the Lord. This is acknowledged in all revealed scriptures and is followed by all authorities. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master, who is a bona fide representative of \u015ar\u012b Hari.\u201d The supreme Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is the spiritual master, and he is nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said that sometimes Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu used to chant the names of the gop\u012bs. Some of the Lord\u2019s students tried to advise Him to chant the name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instead, but upon hearing this Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu became very angry with His students. The controversy on this subject reached a point that after this incident Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu decided to take sanny\u0101sa because He was not taken very seriously in His g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. The point is that since \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu chanted the names of the gop\u012bs, worship of the gop\u012bs or the devotees of the Lord is as good as devotional service rendered directly to the Lord. It is also stated by the Lord Himself that devotional service to His devotees is better than service offered directly to Him. Sometimes the sahajiy\u0101 class of devotees are interested only in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal pastimes to the exclusion of the activities of the devotees. This type of devotee is not on a very high level; one who sees the devotee and the Lord on the same level has further progressed."

        "purport": " In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is recommended that one should become a devotee regardless of one\u2019s condition. Whether one is without desire (ak\u0101ma) or with desire (sak\u0101ma), or whether one desires liberation (mok\u1e63a-k\u0101ma), he is advised to worship the Supreme Lord and execute devotional service unto Him. By so doing, one attains all perfection in any field of life. The process of devotional service \u2014 especially hearing and chanting \u2014 is so powerful that it can bring a person to the perfectional stage. In this verse br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras are mentioned, but here it should be understood that that reference is to the br\u0101hma\u1e47a who is born in a brahminical family, the k\u1e63atriya who is born in a k\u1e63atriya family, the vai\u015bya who is born in a vai\u015bya family, and the \u015b\u016bdra who is born in a \u015b\u016bdra family. But whether one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra, he can attain perfection simply by hearing and chanting. To take birth in a family of br\u0101hma\u1e47as is not the ultimate finishing touch; one must have the power of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, which is called brahma-tejas. Similarly, taking birth in a royal family is not the all in all; one must possess the power to rule the world. Similarly, taking birth as a vai\u015bya is not all; one must possess hundreds or thousands of animals (specifically cows) and rule over other vai\u015byas as Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a vai\u015bya who possessed nine hundred thousand cows and ruled over many cowherd men and boys. A person who is born in a \u015b\u016bdra family can become greater than a br\u0101hma\u1e47a simply by accepting devotional service and giving aural reception to the pastimes of the Lord and His devotees."

Since hearing about P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is one of the items of devotional service (\u015brava\u1e47am), naturally hearing about him brings all good fortune."

Because we associate with the three qualities of material nature, our position in this material world is full of dangers, but when we engage in the devotional service of the Lord by the process of \u015brava\u1e47am and k\u012brtanam, we immediately become vimukta-sa\u1e45ga, or liberated."
