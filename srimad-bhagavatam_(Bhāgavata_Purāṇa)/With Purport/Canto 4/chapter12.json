        "purport": " The conception of \u201cI\u201d and \u201cyou,\u201d aha\u1e41 tvam, as separate from each other, is due to our forgetfulness of our eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the central point, and all of us are His parts and parcels, just as hands and legs are parts and parcels of the whole body. When we actually come to this understanding of being eternally related to the Supreme Lord, this distinction, which is based on the bodily concept of life, cannot exist. The same example can be cited herewith: the hand is the hand, and the leg is the leg, but when both of them engage in the service of the whole body, there is no such distinction as \u201chands\u201d and \u201clegs,\u201d for all of them belong to the whole body, and all the parts working together constitute the whole body. Similarly, when the living entities are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no such distinction as \u201cI\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d because everyone is engaged in the service of the Lord. Since the Lord is absolute, the services are also absolute; even though the hand is working one way and the leg is working in another way, since the purpose is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are all one. This is not to be confused with the statement by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosopher that \u201ceverything is one.\u201d Real knowledge is that hand is hand, leg is leg, body is body, and yet all together they are one. As soon as the living entity thinks that he is independent, his conditional, material existence begins. The conception of independent existence is therefore like a dream. One has to be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his original position. Then he can be freed from material bondage."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is served, the mode of activities to please Him is called service, and one who renders such service is called the servant. Another significant feature in this verse is that only the Lord, and no one else, is to be served. That is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). There is no need to serve the demigods, who are just like the hands and legs of the Supreme Lord. When the Supreme Lord is served, the hands and legs of the Supreme Lord are automatically served. There is no need of separate service. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (12.7), te\u1e63\u0101m aha\u1e41 samuddhart\u0101 m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-s\u0101gar\u0101t. This means that the Lord, in order to show specific favor to the devotee, directs the devotee from within in such a way that ultimately he is delivered from the entanglement of material existence. No one but the Supreme Lord can help the living entity be delivered from the entanglement of this material world. The material energy is a manifestation of one of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s varieties of potencies (par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate). This material energy is one of the Lord\u2019s potencies, as much as heat and light are potencies of fire. The material energy is not different from the Supreme Godhead, but at the same time He has nothing to do with the material energy. The living entity, who is of the marginal energy, is entrapped by the material energy on the basis of his desire to lord it over the material world. The Lord is aloof from this, but when the same living entity engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord, then he becomes attached to this service. This situation is called yuktam. For devotees the Lord is present even in the material energy. This is the inconceivable potency of the Lord. Material energy acts in the three modes of material qualities, which produce the action and reaction of material existence. Those who are not devotees become involved in such activities, whereas devotees, who are dovetailed with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are freed from such action and reaction of the material energy. The Lord is therefore described herewith as bhava-cchidam, one who can give deliverance from the entanglement of material existence."

Such a pure, uncontaminated devotee of the Lord is worthy to have all the benedictions that can be offered by the demigods. He does not have to worship the demigods separately for such benedictions.

Simply by rendering transcendental loving service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can have all the benedictions of the world without separate endeavor. Lord Kuvera said to Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that he had heard that Dhruva was always in sam\u0101dhi, or thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord. In other words, he knew that for Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja there was nothing desirable within the three material worlds. He knew that Dhruva would ask for nothing but to remember the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord constantly."

        "purport": " According to the opinion of expert followers of Vedic rites, there are different types of benedictions in terms of religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation. These four principles are known as catur-vargas. Of all the catur-vargas, the benediction of liberation is considered to be the highest in this material world. To be enabled to cross over material nescience is known as the highest puru\u1e63\u0101rtha, or benediction for the human being. But Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted a benediction which surpasses even the highest puru\u1e63\u0101rtha, liberation. He wanted the benediction that he might constantly remember the lotus feet of the Lord. This stage of life is called pa\u00f1cama-puru\u1e63\u0101rtha. When a devotee comes to the platform of pa\u00f1cama-puru\u1e63\u0101rtha, simply engaging in devotional service to the Lord, the fourth puru\u1e63\u0101rtha, liberation, becomes very insignificant in his eyes. \u015ar\u012bla Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b has stated in this connection that for a devotee liberation is a hellish condition of life; as for sense gratification, which is available in the heavenly planets, the devotee considers it to be a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, having no value in life. Yog\u012bs endeavor to control the senses, but for a devotee, controlling the senses is no difficulty at all. The senses are compared to serpents, but for a devotee the serpents\u2019 poison teeth are broken. Thus \u015ar\u012bla Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b has analyzed all kinds of benedictions available in this world, and he has clearly declared that for a pure devotee they are all of no significance. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was also a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, or a first-class pure devotee, and his intelligence was very great (mah\u0101-mati\u1e25). Unless one is very intelligent, one cannot take to devotional service, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Naturally, anyone who is a first-class devotee must be a first-class intelligent person and therefore not interested in any kind of benediction within this material world. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was offered a benediction by the king of the kings. Kuvera, the treasurer of the demigods, whose only business is to supply immense riches to persons within this materialistic world, is described as the king of kings because unless one is blessed by Kuvera one cannot become a king. The king of kings personally offered Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja any amount of riches, but he declined to accept them. Therefore he is described here as mah\u0101-mati\u1e25 \u2014 very thoughtful, or highly intellectual."

Kuvera is one of the demigods, so one may put forward the argument, \u201cWhy did Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja take a benediction from a demigod?\u201d The answer is that for a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava there is no objection to taking a benediction from a demigod if it is favorable for advancing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The gop\u012bs, for example, worshiped K\u0101ty\u0101yan\u012b, a demigoddess, but the only benediction they wanted from the goddess was to have K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as their husband. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is not interested in asking any benediction from the demigods, nor is he interested in asking benedictions from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not ask Kuvera for transference to the spiritual world, which is called liberation; he simply asked that wherever he would remain \u2014 whether in the spiritual or material world \u2014 he would always remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always respectful to everyone. So when Kuvera offered him a benediction, he did not refuse it.

Prescribed ceremonial sacrifices are especially meant to please Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is the objective of all such sacrifices and who awards the resultant benedictions.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9) it is said, yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25: one should act or work only in order to please the Supreme Lord; otherwise one becomes entangled in the resultant reactions. According to the four divisions of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas are especially advised to perform great ceremonial sacrifices and to distribute their accumulated money very liberally. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, as a king and ideal k\u1e63atriya, performed many such sacrifices, giving very liberally in charity. K\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas are supposed to earn their money and accumulate great riches. Sometimes they do it by acting sinfully. K\u1e63atriyas are meant to rule over a country; Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, for example, in the course of ruling, had to fight and kill many Yak\u1e63as. Such action is necessary for k\u1e63atriyas. A k\u1e63atriya should not be a coward, and he should not be nonviolent; to rule over the country he has to act violently. K\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas are therefore especially advised to give in charity at least fifty percent of their accumulated wealth. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is recommended that even though one enters the renounced order of life, he still cannot give up the performance of yaj\u00f1a, d\u0101na and tapasya. They are never to be given up. Tapasya is meant for the renounced order of life; those who are retired from worldly activities should perform tapasya, penances and austerities. Those who are in the material world, the k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas, must give charity. Brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, in the beginning of their lives, should perform different kinds of yaj\u00f1as. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, as an ideal king, practically emptied his treasury by giving charity. A king is not meant simply to realize taxes from the citizens and accumulate wealth to spend in sense gratification. World monarchy has failed ever since kings began to satisfy their personal senses with the taxes accumulated from the citizens. Of course, whether the system is monarchy or democracy, the same corruption is still going on. At the present moment there are different parties in the democratic government, but everyone is busy trying to keep his post or trying to keep his political party in power. The politicians have very little time to think of the welfare of the citizens, whom they oppress with heavy taxes in the form of income tax, sales tax and many other taxes \u2014 people sometimes have eighty to ninety percent of their income taken away, and these taxes are lavishly spent for the high salaries drawn by the officers and rulers. Formerly, the taxes accumulated from the citizens were spent for performing great sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature. At the present moment, however, almost all forms of sacrifice are not at all possible; therefore, it is recommended in the \u015b\u0101stras that people should perform sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. Any householder, regardless of his position, can perform this sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a without expenditure. All the family members can sit down together and simply clap their hands and chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. Somehow or other, everyone can manage to perform such a yaj\u00f1a and distribute pras\u0101da to the people in general. That is quite sufficient for this Age of Kali. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is based on this principle: chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra at every moment, as much as possible, both inside and outside of the temples, and, as far as possible, distribute pras\u0101da. This process can be accelerated with the cooperation of state administrators and those who are producing the country\u2019s wealth. Simply by liberal distribution of pras\u0101da and sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, the whole world can become peaceful and prosperous. Generally in all the material sacrifices recommended in the Vedic literature there are offerings to the demigods. This demigod worship is especially meant for less intelligent men. Actually, the result of such sacrifice goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29), bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101m: He is actually the enjoyer of all sacrifices. His name, therefore, is Yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a. Although Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a great devotee and had nothing to do with these sacrifices, to set an example to his people he performed many sacrifices and gave all his wealth in charity. For as long as he lived as a householder, he never spent a farthing for his sense gratification. In this verse the word karma-phala-pradam is very significant. The Lord awards everyone different kinds of karma as the individual living entities desire; He is the Supersoul present within the heart of everyone, and He is so kind and liberal that He gives everyone full facilities to perform whatever acts one wants. Then the result of the action is also enjoyed by the living entity. If anyone wants to enjoy or lord it over material nature, the Lord gives him full facilities, but he becomes entangled in the resultant reactions. Similarly, if anyone wants to engage himself fully in devotional service, the Lord gives him full facilities, and the devotee enjoys the results. The Lord is therefore known as karma-phala-prada."

The Lord is called Acyuta because He never fails in His prime duty, to give protection to His devotees.",
        "purport": " Not only did Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja perform many sacrifices, but he carried on his transcendental occupation of engagement in the devotional service of the Lord. The ordinary karm\u012bs, who want to enjoy the results of fruitive activities, are concerned only with sacrifices and ritualistic ceremonies as enjoined in the Vedic \u015b\u0101stras. Although Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja performed many sacrifices in order to be an exemplary king, he was constantly engaged in devotional service. The Lord always protects His surrendered devotee. A devotee can see that the Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be\u00a0\u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati). Ordinary persons cannot understand how the Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, but a devotee can actually see Him. Not only can the devotee see Him outwardly, but he can see, with spiritual vision, that everything is resting in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (mat-sth\u0101ni sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni). That is the vision of a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata. He sees everything others see, but instead of seeing merely the trees, the mountains, the cities or the sky, he sees only his worshipable Supreme Personality of Godhead in everything because everything is resting in Him only. This is the vision of the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata. In summary, a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, a highly elevated pure devotee, sees the Lord everywhere, as well as within the heart of everyone. This is possible for devotees who have developed elevated devotional service to the Lord. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38), prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena: only those who have smeared their eyes with the ointment of love of Godhead can see everywhere the Supreme Lord face to face; it is not possible by imagination or so-called meditation."

        "purport": " The personal qualities of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja described herein are the exemplary qualities of a saintly king. Not only a king but also the leaders of a modern democratic or impersonal government must be qualified with all these godly characteristics. Then the citizens of the state can be happy. It is clearly stated here that the citizens thought of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja as their father. As a child, depending on the able father, is completely satisfied, so the citizens of the state, being protected by the state or the king, should remain satisfied in every respect. At the present moment, however, there is no guarantee by the government of even the primary necessities of life in the state, namely, the protection of the lives and property of the citizens. One word is very significant in this connection: brahma\u1e47yam. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was very devoted to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who engage in the study of the Vedas and thereby know the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are always busy propagating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The state should be very respectful to societies that distribute God consciousness all over the world, but, unfortunately, at the present moment there is no state or government support given to such movements. As for good qualities, it is very difficult to find anyone in state administration with any good qualities. The administrators simply sit in their administrative posts and say no to every request, as if they were paid to say no to the citizens. Another word, d\u012bna-vatsalam, is very significant also. The state head should be very kind to the innocent. Unfortunately, in this age the state agents and the presidents draw good salaries from the state, and they pose themselves as very pious, but they allow the running of slaughterhouses, where innocent animals are killed. If we try to compare the godly qualities of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to the qualities of modern statesmen, we can see that there is no actual comparison. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was present in the Satya-yuga, as will be clear from the next verses. He was the ideal king in Satya-yuga. The government administration in the present age (Kali-yuga) is bereft of all godly qualities. Considering all these points, the people today have no alternative but to take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for protection of religion, life and property."

In the next yuga, Tret\u0101, people used to live for ten thousand years, and in the next yuga, Dv\u0101para, for one thousand years. In the present age, the Kali-yuga, the maximum duration of life is one hundred years. With the change of the yugas, the duration of life and memory, the quality of kindness, and all other good qualities diminish. There are two kinds of activities, namely pious and impious. By executing pious activities one can gain facilities for higher material enjoyment, but due to impious activities one has to undergo severe distress. A devotee, however, is not interested in enjoyment or affected by distress. When he is prosperous he knows, \u201cI am diminishing the results of my pious activities,\u201d and when he is in distress he knows, \u201cI am diminishing the reactions of my impious activities.\u201d A devotee is not concerned with enjoyment or distress; he simply desires to execute devotional service. It is said in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that devotional service should be apratihat\u0101, unchecked by the material conditions of happiness or distress. The devotee undergoes processes of austerity such as observing Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b and similar other fasting days and refraining from illicit sex life, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. Thus he becomes purified from the reactions of his past impious life, and because he engages in devotional service, which is the most pious activity, he enjoys life without separate endeavor."

The perfection of life can be achieved only by devotees.

A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga was never meant to be practiced in a fashionable city. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja went to Badarik\u0101\u015brama, and in a solitary place, alone, he practiced yoga. He concentrated his mind on the arc\u0101-vigraha, the worshipable Deity of the Lord, which exactly represents the Supreme Lord, and thus thinking constantly of that Deity, he became absorbed in trance. Worship of the arc\u0101-vigraha is not idol worship. The arc\u0101-vigraha is an incarnation of the Lord in a form appreciable by a devotee. Therefore devotees engage in the temple in the service of the Lord as arc\u0101-vigraha, a form made of sth\u016bla (material) objects such as stone, metal, wood, jewels or paint. All of these are called sth\u016bla, or physical representations. Since the devotees follow the regulative principles of worship, even though the Lord is there in His physical form He is nondifferent from His original, spiritual form. Thus the devotee gets the benefit of achieving the ultimate goal of life, that is to say, becoming always absorbed in thought of the Lord. This incessant thought of the Lord, as prescribed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, makes one the topmost yog\u012b."

Thus transformed, in a trance of devotional service, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja completely forgot his bodily existence, and thus he immediately became liberated from material bondage.",
        "purport": " Due to constant engagement in devotional service \u2014 hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping the Deity, etc., as prescribed in nine varieties \u2014 there are different symptoms which appear in the body of a devotee. These eight bodily transformations, which indicate that a devotee is already liberated within himself, are called a\u1e63\u1e6da-s\u0101ttvika-vik\u0101ra. When a devotee completely forgets his bodily existence, he should be understood to be liberated. He is no longer encaged in the body. The example is given that when a coconut becomes completely dry, the coconut pulp within the coconut shell separates from the bondage of the shell and the outer covering. By moving the dry coconut, one can hear that the pulp within is no longer attached to the shell or to the covering. Similarly, when one is fully absorbed in devotional service, he is completely disconnected from the two material coverings, the subtle and gross bodies. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja actually attained this stage of life by constantly discharging devotional service. He has already been described as a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, for unless one becomes a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, or a first-class pure devotee, these symptoms are not visible. Lord Caitanya exhibited all these symptoms. \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa also exhibited them, and there are many pure devotees who manifested such bodily symptoms. They are not to be imitated, but when one is actually advanced, these symptoms are exhibited. At that time it is to be understood that a devotee is materially free. Of course, from the beginning of devotional service the path of liberation immediately opens, just as the coconut taken from the tree immediately begins to dry; it simply takes some time for the shell and pulp to separate from one another. An important word in this verse is mukta-li\u1e45ga\u1e25. Mukta means \u201cliberated,\u201d and li\u1e45ga means \u201cthe subtle body.\u201d When a man dies, he quits the gross body, but the subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego carries him to a new body. While existing in the present body, the same subtle body carries him from one stage of life to another (for example, from childhood to boyhood) by mental development. The mental condition of a baby is different from that of a boy, the mental condition of a boy is different from that of a young man, and the mental condition of a young man is different from that of an old man. So at death the process of changing bodies takes place due to the subtle body: the mind, intelligence and ego carry the soul from one gross body to another. This is called transmigration of the soul. But there is another stage, when one becomes liberated even from the subtle body; at that time the living entity is competent and fully prepared to be transferred to the transcendental or spiritual world. The description of the bodily symptoms of \u015ar\u012b Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja makes it apparent that he became perfectly fit to be transferred to the spiritual world. One can experience the distinction between the subtle and gross bodies even daily: in a dream, one\u2019s gross body is lying on the bed while the subtle body carries the soul, the living entity, to another atmosphere. But because the gross body has to be continued, the subtle body comes back and settles in the present gross body. Therefore one has to become free from the subtle body also. This freedom is known as mukta-li\u1e45ga."

When the two confidential servants of the Supreme Lord, who were named Nanda and Sunanda, approached him, smiling happily, Dhruva stood with folded hands, bowing humbly. They then addressed him as follows.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word pu\u1e63karan\u0101bha-sammatau is significant. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is known for His lotus eyes, lotus navel, lotus feet and lotus palms. Here He is called pu\u1e63kara-n\u0101bha, which means \u201cthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has a lotus navel,\u201d and sammatau means \u201ctwo confidential or very obedient servants.\u201d The materialistic way of life differs from the spiritual way of life in that one is disobedience and the other is obedience to the will of the Supreme Lord. All living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and they are supposed to be always agreeable to the order of the Supreme Person; that is perfect oneness. In the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world all the living entities are in oneness with the Supreme Godhead because they never defy His orders. Here in the material world, however, they are not sammata, agreeable, but always asammata, disagreeable. This human form of life is a chance to be trained to be agreeable to the orders of the Supreme Lord. To bring about this training in society is the mission of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. As stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the laws of material nature are very strict; no one can overcome the stringent laws of material nature. But one who becomes a surrendered soul and agrees to the order of the Supreme Lord can easily overcome those stringent laws. The example of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is very fitting. Simply by becoming agreeable to the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by developing love of Godhead, Dhruva got the chance to personally meet the confidential servants of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u face to face. What was possible for Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is possible for everyone. Anyone who very seriously engages in devotional service can obtain, in due course of time, the same perfection of the human form of life."

This principle stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 operated in the case of King Dhruva. Throughout his life he tried to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by austerity and penances.

The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is so potent that by adopting these principles of life and developing love of God one can very easily go back home, back to Godhead. Here the practical example is the case of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. While the scientist and philosopher go to the moon but are disappointed in their attempts to stay there and live, the devotee makes an easy journey to other planets and ultimately goes back to Godhead. Devotees have no interest in seeing other planets, but while going back to Godhead they see all of them as passing phases, just as one who is going to a distant place passes through many small stations."

Please come with us and live there eternally.",
        "purport": " When Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja went to perform austerities, he was very determined to achieve a post never dreamed of by his forefathers. His father was Utt\u0101nap\u0101da, his grandfather was Manu, and his great-grandfather was Lord Brahm\u0101. So Dhruva wanted a kingdom even greater than Lord Brahm\u0101 could achieve, and he requested N\u0101rada Muni to give him facility for achieving it. The associates of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u reminded him that not only his forefathers but everyone else before him was unable to attain Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka, the planet where Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u resides. This is because everyone within this material world is either a karm\u012b, a j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b or a yog\u012b, but there are hardly any pure devotees. The transcendental planet known as Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka is especially meant for devotees, not for karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs or yog\u012bs. Great \u1e5b\u1e63is or demigods can hardly approach Brahmaloka, and as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Brahmaloka is not a permanent residence. Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s duration of life is so long that it is difficult to estimate even the duration of one day in his life, and yet Lord Brahm\u0101 also dies, as do the residents of his planet. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.16) says, \u0101brahma-bhuvan\u0101l lok\u0101\u1e25 punar \u0101vartino\u00a0\u2019rjuna: except for those who go to Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka, everyone is subjected to the four principles of material life, namely birth, death, old age and disease. The Lord says, yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante tad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama: \u201cThe planet from which, once going, no one returns is My supreme abode.\u201d (Bg. 15.6) Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was reminded, \u201cYou are going in our company to that planet from which no one returns to this material world.\u201d Material scientists are attempting to go to the moon and other planets, but they cannot imagine going to the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, for it is beyond their imagination. By material calculation, traveling at the speed of light it would take forty thousand light-years to reach the topmost planet. By mechanical processes we are unable to reach the topmost planet of this universe, but the process called bhakti-yoga, as executed by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva, can give one the facility not only to reach other planets within this universe, but also to reach beyond this universe to the Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka planets. We have outlined this in our small booklet Easy Journey to Other Planets."

The Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha airplane does not move by mechanical arrangement. There are three processes for moving in outer space. One of the processes is known to the modern scientist. It is called ka-pota-v\u0101yu. Ka means \u201couter space,\u201d and pota means \u201cship.\u201d There is a second process also called kapota-v\u0101yu.

As Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshipable, so also are His associates, His paraphernalia, His airplane and His abode, for everything of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s is as good as Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja knew all this very well, as a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, and he offered his respects to the associates and to the plane before riding in it.

It is said, therefore, that to live in the forest is in the mode of goodness, to live in the city is in the mode of passion, and to live in a brothel, liquor shop or slaughterhouse is in the mode of ignorance, but to live in the temple means to live in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka.

        "purport": " To take the passing away of a devotee and the passing away of a nondevotee as one and the same is completely misleading. While ascending the transcendental airplane, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja suddenly saw death personified before him, but he was not afraid. Instead of death\u2019s giving him trouble, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja took advantage of death\u2019s presence and put his feet on the head of death. People with a poor fund of knowledge do not know the difference between the death of a devotee and the death of a nondevotee. In this connection, an example can be given: A cat carries its kittens in its mouth, and it also catches a rat in its mouth. Superficially, the catching of the rat and the kitten appear to be one and the same, but actually they are not. When the cat catches the rat in its mouth it means death for the rat, whereas when the cat catches the kitten, the kitten enjoys it. When Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja boarded the airplane, he took advantage of the arrival of death personified, who came to offer him obeisances; putting his feet on the head of death, he got up on the unique airplane, which is described here to be as big as a house (g\u1e5bham). There are many other similar instances in Bh\u0101gavata literature. It is stated that when Kardama Muni created an airplane to carry his wife, Devah\u016bti, all over the universe, the airplane was like a big city, carrying many houses, lakes and gardens. Modern scientists have manufactured big airplanes, but they are packed with passengers, who experience all sorts of discomforts while riding in them. Material scientists are not even perfect in manufacturing a material airplane. In order to compare to the plane used by Kardama or the plane sent from Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka, they must manufacture an airplane equipped like a big city, with all the comforts of life \u2014 lakes, gardens, parks, etc. Their plane must be able to fly in outer space and hover, and visit all other planets. If they invent such a plane, they will not have to make different space stations for fuel to travel into outer space. Such a plane would have an unlimited supply of fuel, or, like the plane from Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka, would fly without it."

        "translation": "Dhruva was seated in the transcendental airplane, which was just about to start, when he remembered his poor mother, Sun\u012bti. He thought to himself, \u201cHow shall I go alone to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet and leave behind my poor mother?\u201d",
        "purport": " Dhruva had a feeling of obligation to his mother, Sun\u012bti. It was Sun\u012bti who had given him the clue which had now enabled him to be personally carried to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet by the associates of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. He now remembered her and wanted to take her with him. Actually, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s mother, Sun\u012bti, was his patha-pradar\u015baka-guru. Patha-pradar\u015baka-guru means \u201cthe guru, or the spiritual master, who shows the way.\u201d Such a guru is sometimes called \u015bik\u1e63\u0101-guru. Although N\u0101rada Muni was his d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101-guru (initiating spiritual master), Sun\u012bti, his mother, was the first who gave him instruction on how to achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is the duty of the \u015bik\u1e63\u0101-guru or d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101-guru to instruct the disciple in the right way, and it depends on the disciple to execute the process. According to \u015b\u0101stric injunctions, there is no difference between \u015bik\u1e63\u0101-guru and d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101-guru, and generally the \u015bik\u1e63\u0101-guru later on becomes the d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101-guru. Sun\u012bti, however, being a woman, and specifically his mother, could not become Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101-guru. Still, he was not less obliged to Sun\u012bti. There was no question of carrying N\u0101rada Muni to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, but Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja thought of his mother. Whatever plan the Supreme Personality of Godhead contemplates immediately fructifies. Similarly, a devotee who is completely dependent on the Supreme Lord can also fulfill his wishes by the grace of the Lord. The Lord fulfills His wishes independently, but a devotee fulfills his wishes simply by being dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore as soon as Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja thought of his poor mother, he was assured by the associates of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u that Sun\u012bti was also going to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, in another plane. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had thought that he was going alone to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, leaving behind his mother, which was not very auspicious because people would criticize him for going alone to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka and not carrying with him Sun\u012bti, who had given him so much. But Dhruva also considered that he was not personally the Supreme. Therefore, only if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fulfilled his desires would it be possible. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could immediately understand his mind, and He told Dhruva that his mother was also going with him. This incident proves that a pure devotee like Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja can fulfill all his desires; by the grace of the Lord, he becomes exactly like the Lord, and thus whenever he thinks of anything, his wish is immediately fulfilled."

Similarly, by going to the planet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can know all the other planetary systems on the path to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. We should remember that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s body was different from our bodies. While boarding the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha airplane, his body changed to a completely spiritual golden hue. No one can surpass the higher planets in a material body, but when one gets a spiritual body he can travel not only to the higher planetary system of this material world, but even to the still higher planetary system known as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. It is well known that N\u0101rada Muni travels everywhere, both in the spiritual and material worlds. It should be noted also that while Sun\u012bti was going to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka she also changed her body into a spiritual form. Like \u015ar\u012b Sun\u012bti, every mother should train her child to become a devotee like Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Sun\u012bti instructed her son, even at the age of five years, to be unattached to worldly affairs and to go to the forest to search out the Supreme Lord. She never desired that her son remain at home comfortably without ever undertaking austerities and penances to achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Every mother, like Sun\u012bti, must take care of her son and train him to become a brahmac\u0101r\u012b from the age of five years and to undergo austerities and penances for spiritual realization. The benefit will be that if her son becomes a strong devotee like Dhruva, certainly not only will he be transferred back home, back to Godhead, but she will also be transferred with him to the spiritual world, even though she may be unable to undergo austerities and penances in executing devotional service."

Only persons who constantly engage in welfare activities for other living entities can reach the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets.",
        "purport": " Here is a description of two aspects of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. The first is that in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha sky there is no need of the sun and moon. This is confirmed by the Upani\u1e63ads as well as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (na tad bh\u0101sayate s\u016bryo na \u015ba\u015b\u0101\u1e45ko na p\u0101vaka\u1e25). In the spiritual world the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas are themselves illuminated; there is therefore no need of sun, moon or electric light. It is in fact the illumination of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas which is reflected in the material sky. Only by this reflection are the suns in the material universes illuminated; after the illumination of the sun, all the stars and moons are illuminated. In other words, all the luminaries in the material sky borrow illumination from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. From this material world, however, people can be transferred to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, if they incessantly engage in welfare activities for all other living entities. Such incessant welfare activities can really be performed only in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There is no philanthropic work within this material world but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness that can engage a person twenty-four hours a day. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious being is always engaged in planning how to take all of suffering humanity back home, back to Godhead. Even if one is not successful in reclaiming all the fallen souls back to Godhead, still, because he is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, his path to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka is open. He personally becomes qualified to enter the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas, and if anyone follows such a devotee, he also enters into Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. Others, who engage in envious activities, are known as karm\u012bs. Karm\u012bs are envious of one another. Simply for sense gratification, they can kill thousands of innocent animals. J\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are not as sinful as karm\u012bs, but they do not try to reclaim others back to Godhead. They perform austerities for their own liberation. Yog\u012bs are also engaged in self-aggrandizement by trying to attain mystic powers. But devotees, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, who are servants of the Lord, come forward in the actual field of work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to reclaim fallen souls. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious persons are eligible to enter into the spiritual world. That is clearly stated in this verse and is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, wherein the Lord says that there is no one dearer to Him than those who preach the gospel of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to the world."

        "purport": " The description of this verse fully indicates that only devotees are eligible to enter into the kingdom of Godhead. The first point stated is that devotees are peaceful, for they have no demands for their personal sense gratification. They are simply dedicated to the service of the Lord. Karm\u012bs cannot be peaceful because they have immense demands for sense gratification. As for j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, they cannot be peaceful because they are too busy trying to attain liberation or merge into the existence of the Supreme. Similarly, yog\u012bs are also restless to get mystic power. But a devotee is peaceful because he is fully surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thinks of himself as completely helpless; just as a child feels complete peace in depending on the parent, so a devotee is completely peaceful, for he depends on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee is equipoised. He sees everyone on the same transcendental platform. A devotee knows that although a conditioned soul has a particular type of body according to his past fruitive activities, factually everyone is part of the Supreme Lord. A devotee sees all living entities with spiritual vision and does not discriminate on the platform of the bodily concept of life. Such qualities develop only in the association of devotees. Without the association of devotees, one cannot advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, we have established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Factually, whoever lives in this society automatically develops K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Devotees are dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is only dear to devotees. On this platform only can one make progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or devotees of the Lord, can please everyone, as is evident in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. We invite everyone, without discrimination; we request everyone to sit down and chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and take as much pras\u0101da as we can supply, and thus everyone is pleased with us. This is the qualification: sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101nura\u00f1jan\u0101\u1e25. As for purification, no one can be more pure than devotees. Anyone who once utters the name of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u immediately becomes purified, inside and outside (ya\u1e25 smaret pu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u012bk\u0101k\u1e63am). Since a devotee constantly chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, no contamination of the material world can touch him. He is, therefore, actually purified. Muci haya \u015buci haya yadi k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a bhaje: it is said that even a cobbler or person born in the family of a cobbler can be elevated to the position of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a (\u015buci) if he takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Any person who is purely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and who engages in chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra is the purest in the whole universe."

As far as ordinary kings are concerned, it is not at all possible.

Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unconquerable, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja defeated Him with the specific qualifications possessed by the Lord\u2019s devotees.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Godhead is unconquerable; no one can conquer the Lord. But He voluntarily accepts subordination to the devotional qualities of His devotees. For example, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a accepted subordination to the control of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 because she was a great devotee. The Lord likes to be under the control of His devotees. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that everyone comes before the Lord and offers Him exalted prayers, but the Lord does not feel as pleased when offered such prayers as He does when a devotee, out of pure love, chastises Him as a subordinate. The Lord forgets His exalted position and willingly submits to His pure devotee. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja conquered the Supreme Lord because at a very tender age, only five years old, he underwent all the austerities of devotional service. This devotional service was of course executed under the direction of a great sage, N\u0101rada. This is the first principle of devotional service \u2014 \u0101dau gurv-\u0101\u015brayam. In the beginning one must accept a bona fide spiritual master, and if a devotee follows strictly the direction of the spiritual master, as Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja followed the instruction of N\u0101rada Muni, then it is not difficult for him to achieve the favor of the Lord. The sum total of devotional qualities is development of unalloyed love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This unalloyed love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be achieved simply by hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord Caitanya accepted this principle \u2014 that if one in any position submissively hears the transcendental message spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then gradually he develops the quality of unalloyed love, and by that love only he can conquer the unconquerable. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers aspire to become one with the Supreme Lord, but a devotee surpasses that position. Not only does a devotee become one in quality with the Supreme Lord, but he sometimes becomes the father, mother or master of the Lord. Arjuna also, by his devotional service, made Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a his chariot driver; he ordered the Lord, \u201cPut my chariot here,\u201d and the Lord executed his order. These are some examples of how a devotee can acquire the exalted position of conquering the unconquerable."

        "purport": " Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is described herein as k\u1e63atra-bandhu\u1e25, which indicates that he was not fully trained as a k\u1e63atriya because he was only five years old; he was not a mature k\u1e63atriya. A k\u1e63atriya or br\u0101hma\u1e47a has to take training. A boy born in the family of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is not immediately a br\u0101hma\u1e47a; he has to take up the training and the purificatory process. The great sage N\u0101rada Muni was very proud of having a devotee-disciple like Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. He had many other disciples, but he was very pleased with Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja because in one lifetime, by dint of his severe penances and austerities, he had achieved Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, which was never achieved by any other king\u2019s son or r\u0101jar\u1e63i throughout the whole universe. There is the instance of the great King Bharata, who was also a great devotee, but he attained Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka in three lives. In the first life, although he executed austerities in the forest, he became a victim of too much affection for a small deer, and in his next life he had to take birth as a deer. Although he had a deer\u2019s body, he remembered his spiritual position, but he still had to wait until the next life for perfection. In the next life he took birth as Ja\u1e0da Bharata. Of course, in that life he was completely freed from all material entanglement, and he attained perfection and was elevated to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. The lesson from the life of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is that if one likes, one can attain Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka in one life, without waiting for many other lives. My Guru Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bmad Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Prabhup\u0101da, used to say that every one of his disciples could attain Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka in this life, without waiting for another life to execute devotional service. One simply has to become as serious and sincere as Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja; then it is quite possible to attain Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka and go back home, back to Godhead, in one life."

Neophyte devotees simply try to understand the pastimes of the Lord and are not very interested in hearing about the activities of His devotees, but such discrimination should not be indulged in by any real devotee. Sometimes less intelligent men try to hear about the r\u0101sa dance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and do not take care to hear about other portions of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which they completely avoid.

This kind of discrimination and abrupt adoption of the r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101 pastimes of the Lord is not approved by the \u0101c\u0101ryas. A sincere devotee should read every chapter and every word of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, for the beginning verses describe that it is the ripened fruit of all Vedic literature.

        "purport": " It is said that only in the association of devotees can one understand the importance of the character and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotees. In this verse it is especially recommended that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s character be discussed in a society of the twice-born, which refers to the qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas. One should especially seek the society of br\u0101hma\u1e47as who are elevated to the position of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Thus discussion of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which describes the character and pastimes of devotees and the Lord, is very quickly effective. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness has been organized for this purpose. In every center of this Society \u2014 not only in the morning, evening or noon, but practically twenty-four hours a day \u2014 there is continuous devotional service going on. Anyone who comes in contact with the Society automatically becomes a devotee. We have actual experience that many karm\u012bs and others come to the Society and find a very pleasing and peaceful atmosphere in the temples of ISKCON. In this verse the word dvi-janman\u0101m means \u201cof the twice-born.\u201d Anyone can join the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and be initiated to become twice-born. As recommended by San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, by the process of initiation and authorized training, any man can become twice-born. The first birth is made possible by the parents, and the second birth is made possible by the spiritual father and Vedic knowledge. Unless one is twice-born one cannot understand the transcendental characteristics of the Lord and His devotees. Study of the Vedas is therefore forbidden for \u015b\u016bdras. Simply by academic qualifications a \u015b\u016bdra cannot understand the transcendental science. At the present moment, throughout the entire world the educational system is geared to produce \u015b\u016bdras. A big technologist is no more than a big \u015b\u016bdra. Kalau \u015b\u016bdra-sambhava\u1e25: in the Age of Kali, everyone is a \u015b\u016bdra. Because the whole population of the world consists only of \u015b\u016bdras, there is a decline of spiritual knowledge, and people are unhappy. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has been started especially to create qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as to broadcast spiritual knowledge all over the world, for thus people may become very happy."

Only one who is completely surrendered at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, depending fully on Him for personal maintenance or even for maintenance of his family, can attain perfection by recitation of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which is full of narrations of the pastimes of the Lord and His devotees. The process can be summarized as follows: the audience must be faithfully receptive to the Bh\u0101gavata message, and the reciter should completely depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bh\u0101gavata recitation must not be a business. If done in the right way, not only does the reciter achieve perfect satisfaction, but the Lord also is very satisfied with the reciter and the audience, and thus both are liberated from material bondage simply by the process of hearing."

Those who out of transcendental kindness take on the responsibility of becoming master-protectors of the poor living entities automatically gain the interest and blessings of the demigods.",
        "purport": " J\u00f1\u0101nam aj\u00f1\u0101ta means knowledge which is unknown almost throughout the entire world. No one knows actually what is the Absolute Truth. Materialists are very proud of their advancement in education, in philosophical speculation and in scientific knowledge, but no one actually knows what the Absolute Truth is. The great sage Maitreya, therefore, recommends that to enlighten people about the Absolute Truth (tattva) devotees should preach the teachings of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam throughout the entire world. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva especially compiled this great literature of scientific knowledge because people are completely unaware of the Absolute Truth. In the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, First Canto, it is said that Vy\u0101sadeva, the learned sage, compiled this great Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a just to stop the ignorance of the mass of people. Because people do not know the Absolute Truth, this \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was specifically compiled by Vy\u0101sadeva under the instruction of N\u0101rada. Generally, even though people are interested in understanding the truth, they take to speculation and reach at most the conception of impersonal Brahman. But very few men actually know the Personality of Godhead. Recitation of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is specifically meant to enlighten people about the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although there is no fundamental difference between impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the Supreme Person, factual immortality cannot be obtained unless and until one attains the stage of associating with the Supreme Person. Devotional service, which leads to the association of the Supreme Lord, is actual immortality. Pure devotees, out of compassion for the fallen souls, are k\u1e5bp\u0101lu, very kind to people in general; they distribute this Bh\u0101gavata knowledge all over the world. A kindhearted devotee is called d\u012bna-n\u0101tha, protector of the poor, ignorant mass of people. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also known as d\u012bna-n\u0101tha or d\u012bna-bandhu, the master or actual friend of the poor living entities, and His pure devotee also takes the same position of d\u012bna-n\u0101tha. The d\u012bna-n\u0101thas, or devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who preach the path of devotional service, become the favorites of the demigods. Generally people are interested in worshiping the demigods, especially Lord \u015aiva, in order to obtain material benefits, but a pure devotee, who engages in preaching the principles of devotional service, as prescribed in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, does not need to separately worship the demigods; the demigods are automatically pleased with him and offer all the blessings within their capacity. As by watering the root of a tree the leaves and branches are automatically watered, so, by executing pure devotional service to the Lord, the branches, twigs and leaves of the Lord, known as demigods, are automatically pleased with the devotee, and they offer all benedictions."
