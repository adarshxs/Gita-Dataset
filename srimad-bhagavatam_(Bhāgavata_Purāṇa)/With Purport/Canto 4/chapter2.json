The word \u015biva means \u201call-auspicious.\u201d No one can be an enemy of Lord \u015aiva\u2019s, for he is so peaceful and renounced that he does not even construct a house for his residence, but lives underneath a tree, always detached from all worldly things.

Lord \u015aiva takes charge of reforming persons who are ghosts and demons, not to speak of others, who are godly; therefore he is the spiritual master of everyone, both the dull and demoniac and the highly learned Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas.

Even if he is an enemy or is sometimes angry, such a personality cannot be the object of envy, so Vidura, in astonishment, asked why he was taken as such, especially by Dak\u1e63a. Dak\u1e63a is also not an ordinary person. He is a Praj\u0101pati, in charge of fathering population, and all his daughters are highly elevated, especially Sat\u012b. The word sat\u012b means \u201cthe most chaste.\u201d Whenever there is consideration of chastity, Sat\u012b, this wife of Lord \u015aiva and daughter of Dak\u1e63a, is considered first. Vidura was therefore astonished. \u201cDak\u1e63a is such a great man,\u201d he thought, \u201cand is the father of Sat\u012b. And Lord \u015aiva is the spiritual master of everyone. How then could there possibly be so much enmity between them that Sat\u012b, the most chaste goddess, could give up her body because of their quarrel?\u201d"

They take shelter of Lord \u015aiva because he is very kind to everyone and is very quickly satisfied. Therefore he is called \u0100\u015buto\u1e63a.

Lord \u015aiva is so kind that he gives shelter to such creatures and gradually elevates them to spiritual consciousness. Although it is very difficult to raise such creatures to spiritual understanding, Lord \u015aiva takes charge of them, and therefore, as stated in the Vedas, Lord \u015aiva is all-auspicious. Thus by his association even such fallen souls can be elevated. Sometimes it is seen that great personalities meet with fallen souls, not for any personal interest but for the benefit of those souls. In the creation of the Lord there are different kinds of living creatures. Some of them are in the mode of goodness, some are in the mode of passion, and some are in the mode of ignorance. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u takes charge of persons who are advanced K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, and Lord Brahm\u0101 takes charge of persons who are very much attached to material activities, but Lord \u015aiva is so kind that he takes charge of persons who are in gross ignorance and whose behavior is lower than that of the animals.

Lord \u015aiva is the greatest devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and it is not fitting for him to eat or sit with materialistic persons like the demigods. Thus the curse of Dak\u1e63a was indirectly a blessing, for \u015aiva would not have to eat or sit with other demigods, who were too materialistic. There is a practical example set for us by Gauraki\u015bora d\u0101sa B\u0101b\u0101j\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who used to sit on the side of a latrine to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Many materialistic persons used to come and bother him and disturb his daily routine of chanting, so to avoid their company he used to sit by the side of a latrine, where materialistic persons would not go because of the filth and the obnoxious smell. However, Gauraki\u015bora d\u0101sa B\u0101b\u0101j\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was so great that he was accepted as the spiritual master of such a great personality as His Divine Grace O\u1e41 Vi\u1e63\u1e47up\u0101da \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bmad Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja.

        "purport": " Anger is so detrimental that even a great personality like Dak\u1e63a, out of anger, left the arena where Brahm\u0101 was presiding and all the great sages and pious and saintly persons were assembled. All of them requested him not to leave, but, infuriated, he left, thinking that the auspicious place was not fit for him. Puffed up by his exalted position, he thought that no one was greater than he in argument. It appears that all the members of the assembly, including Lord Brahm\u0101, requested him not to be angry and leave their company, but in spite of all these requests, he left. That is the effect of cruel anger. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, therefore, it is advised that one who desires to make tangible advancement in spiritual consciousness must avoid three things \u2014 lust, anger and the mode of passion. Actually we can see that lust, anger and passion make a man crazy, even though he be as great as Dak\u1e63a. The very name Dak\u1e63a suggests that he was expert in all material activities, but still, because of his aversion towards such a saintly personality as \u015aiva, he was attacked by these three enemies \u2014 anger, lust and passion. Lord Caitanya therefore advised that one be very careful not to offend Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. He compared offenses toward a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava to a mad elephant. As a mad elephant can do anything horrible, so when a person offends a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava he can perform any abominable action."

His eyes became red, and he prepared to curse Dak\u1e63a and all the br\u0101hma\u1e47as present there who had tolerated Dak\u1e63a\u2019s cursing \u015aiva in harsh words.",
        "purport": " There is a long-standing dissension among some of the neophyte Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and \u015aaivites; they are always at loggerheads. When Dak\u1e63a cursed Lord \u015aiva in harsh words, some of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as present might have enjoyed it because some br\u0101hma\u1e47as do not very much admire Lord \u015aiva. This is due to their ignorance of Lord \u015aiva\u2019s position. Nand\u012b\u015bvara was affected by the cursing, but he did not follow the example of Lord \u015aiva, who was also present there. Although Lord \u015aiva could also have cursed Dak\u1e63a in a similar way, he was silent and tolerant; but Nand\u012b\u015bvara, his follower, was not tolerant. Of course, as a follower it was right for him not to tolerate an insult to his master, but he should not have cursed the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who were present. The entire issue was so complicated that those who were not strong enough forgot their positions, and thus cursing and countercursing went on in that great assembly. In other words, the material field is so unsteady that even personalities like Nand\u012b\u015bvara, Dak\u1e63a and many of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as present were infected by the atmosphere of anger."

        "purport": " The third curse inflicted by Nand\u012b\u015bvara on the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who supported Dak\u1e63a is completely functioning in the Age of Kali. The so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47as are no longer interested in understanding the nature of the Supreme Brahman, although a br\u0101hma\u1e47a means one who has attained knowledge about Brahman. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra also it is stated, ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101: this human form of life is meant for realization of the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute Truth, or, in other words, human life is meant for one\u2019s elevation to the post of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Unfortunately the modern br\u0101hma\u1e47as, or so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47as who come in originally brahminical families, have left their own occupational duties, but they do not allow others to occupy the posts of br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The qualifications for br\u0101hma\u1e47as are described in the scriptures, in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and all other Vedic literatures. Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is not a hereditary title or position. If someone from a non-br\u0101hma\u1e47a family (for example, one born in a family of \u015b\u016bdras) tries to become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by being properly qualified under the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, these so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47as will object. Such br\u0101hma\u1e47as, having been cursed by Nand\u012b\u015bvara, are actually in a position where they have no discrimination between eatables and noneatables and simply live to maintain the perishable material body and its family. Such fallen conditioned souls are not worthy to be called br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but in Kali-yuga they claim to be br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and if a person actually tries to attain the brahminical qualifications, they try to hinder his progress. This is the situation in the present age. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu condemned this principle very strongly. During His conversation with R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya, He said that regardless of whether a person is born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family or \u015b\u016bdra family, regardless of whether he is a householder or a sanny\u0101s\u012b, if he knows the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he must be a spiritual master. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu had many so-called \u015b\u016bdra disciples, like Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura and R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya. Even the Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, who were principal students of Lord Caitanya, were also ostracized from br\u0101hma\u1e47a society, but Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, by His grace, made them first-class Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas."

        "purport": " The word duratyaya is particularly used in reference to a brahmada\u1e47\u1e0da, or curse by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. A curse by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is very strong; therefore it is called duratyaya, or insurmountable. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the stringent laws of nature are insurmountable; similarly, if a curse is uttered by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, that curse is also insurmountable. But Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also says that the curses or benedictions of the material world are, after all, material creations. The Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta confirms that that which is accepted in this material world to be a benediction and that which is taken to be a curse are both on the same platform because they are material. To get out of this material contamination, one should take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as recommended in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te. The best path is to transcend all material curses and benedictions and take shelter of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and remain in a transcendental position. Persons who have taken shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are always peaceful; they are never cursed by anyone, nor do they attempt to curse anyone. That is a transcendental position."

        "purport": " It is sometimes seen that devotees of Lord \u015aiva imitate the characteristics of Lord \u015aiva. For example, Lord \u015aiva drank an ocean of poison, so some of the followers of Lord \u015aiva imitate him and try to take intoxicants like g\u0101\u00f1j\u0101 (marijuana). Here the curse is that if someone follows such principles he must become an infidel and turn against the principles of Vedic regulation. It is said that such devotees of Lord \u015aiva will be sac-ch\u0101stra-paripanthina\u1e25, which means \u201copposed to the conclusion of \u015b\u0101stra, or scripture.\u201d This is confirmed in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a also. Lord \u015aiva was ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to preach the impersonal, or M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da, philosophy for a particular purpose, just as Lord Buddha preached the philosophy of voidness for particular purposes mentioned in the \u015b\u0101stras. Sometimes it is necessary to preach a philosophical doctrine which is against the Vedic conclusion. In the \u015aiva Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is stated that Lord \u015aiva said to P\u0101rvat\u012b that in the Kali-yuga, in the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he would preach the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy. Thus it is generally found that the worshipers of Lord \u015aiva are M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b followers. Lord \u015aiva himself says, m\u0101y\u0101v\u0101dam asac-ch\u0101stram. Asat-\u015b\u0101stra, as explained here, means the doctrine of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da impersonalism, or becoming one with the Supreme. Bh\u1e5bgu Muni cursed that persons who worshiped Lord \u015aiva would become followers of this M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da asat-\u015b\u0101stra, which attempts to establish that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is impersonal. Besides that, among the worshipers of Lord \u015aiva there is a section who live a devilish life. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra are authorized scriptures that are considered sat-\u015b\u0101stra, or scriptures which lead one to the path of God realization. Asat-\u015b\u0101stras are just the opposite."

Human civilization is based on the qualitative divisions of social order, namely the intelligent class, the martial class, the productive class and the laborer class. The Vedas provide the right direction for advancing in spiritual cultivation and economic development and regulating the principle of sense gratification, so that ultimately one may be liberated from material contamination to his real state of spiritual identification (aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi). As long as one is in the contamination of material existence, one changes bodies from the aquatics up to the position of Brahm\u0101, but the human form of life is the highest perfectional life in the material world. The Vedas give directions by which to elevate oneself in the next life. The Vedas are the mother for such instructions, and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, or persons who are in knowledge of the Vedas, are the father. Thus if one blasphemes the Vedas and br\u0101hma\u1e47as, naturally one goes down to the status of atheism. The exact word used in Sanskrit is n\u0101stika, which refers to one who does not believe in the Vedas but manufactures some concocted system of religion. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has said that the followers of the Buddhist system of religion are n\u0101stikas. In order to establish his doctrine of nonviolence, Lord Buddha flatly refused to believe in the Vedas, and thus, later on, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya stopped this system of religion in India and forced it to go outside India. Here it is stated, brahma ca br\u0101hma\u1e47\u0101n. Brahma means the Vedas. Aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi means \u201cI am in full knowledge.\u201d The Vedic assertion is that one should think that he is Brahman, for actually he is Brahman. If brahma, or the Vedic spiritual science, is condemned, and the masters of the spiritual science, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, are condemned, then where does human civilization stand? Bh\u1e5bgu Muni said, \u201cIt is not due to my cursing that you shall become atheists; you are already situated in the principle of atheism. Therefore you are condemned.\u201d"

        "translation": "The Vedas give the eternal regulative principles for auspicious advancement in human civilization which have been rigidly followed in the past. The strong evidence of this principle is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is called Jan\u0101rdana, the well-wisher of all living entities.",
        "purport": " In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has claimed that He is the father of all living entities, regardless of form. There are 8,400,000 different species of life forms, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a claims that He is the father of all. Because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are all sons of the Lord, and for their benefit, because they are hovering under the impression that they can lord it over material nature, the Vedas are given to them for their guidance. Therefore the Vedas are called apauru\u1e63eya, for they are not written by any man or demigod, including the first living creature, Brahm\u0101. Brahm\u0101 is not the creator or author of the Vedas. He is also one of the living beings in this material world; therefore he does not have the power to write or speak the Vedas independently. Every living entity within this material world is subject to four deficiencies: he commits mistakes, he accepts one thing for another, he cheats, and he has imperfect senses. The Vedas, however, are not written by any living creature within this material world. Therefore they are said to be apauru\u1e63eya. No one can trace out the history of the Vedas. Of course, modern human civilization has no chronological history of the world or the universe, and it cannot present actual historical facts older than three thousand years. But no one has traced out when the Vedas were written, because they were never written by any living being within this material world. All other systems of knowledge are defective because they have been written or spoken by men or demigods who are products of this material creation, but Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is apauru\u1e63eya, for it was not spoken by any human being or any demigod of this material creation; it was spoken by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is beyond the material creation. That is accepted by such stalwart scholars as \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, not to speak of other \u0101c\u0101ryas such as R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya and Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya. \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya has accepted that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are transcendental, and in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has established, aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhavo matta\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 pravartate: \u201cI am the origin of everything; everything emanates from Me.\u201d This material creation, including Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva and all the demigods, has been created by Him, for everything has emanated from Him. He also says that the purpose of all the Vedas is to understand Him (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). He is the original veda-vit, or knower of the Vedas, and ved\u0101nta-k\u1e5bt, or compiler of Ved\u0101nta. Brahm\u0101 is not the compiler of the Vedas. In the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is established, tene brahma h\u1e5bd\u0101: the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, instructed Brahm\u0101 in the Vedic knowledge through his heart. Therefore the evidence that Vedic knowledge is free from the defects of mistakes, illusions, cheating and imperfection is that it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Jan\u0101rdana, and has thus been followed from time immemorial, beginning from Brahm\u0101. The Vedic religion or the principles of the Vedas have been followed by the highly cultured population of India since time immemorial; no one can trace out the history of Vedic religion. Therefore it is san\u0101tana, and any blasphemy against the Vedas is calculated to be atheism. The Vedas are described as setu, which means \u201ca bridge.\u201d If one wants to attain his spiritual existence, one has to cross an ocean of nescience. The Vedas are the bridge by which to cross such a great ocean. The Vedas describe how to divide the human race into four divisions according to quality and working capacity. This is a very scientific system, and it is also san\u0101tana, for no one can trace out its history and it has no dissolution. No one can stop the system of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama, or the castes and divisions. For example, whether or not one accepts the name br\u0101hma\u1e47a, there is a class in society which is known as the intelligent class and which is interested in spiritual understanding and philosophy. Similarly, there is a class of men who are interested in administration and in ruling others. In the Vedic system these martially spirited men are called k\u1e63atriyas. Similarly, everywhere there is a class of men who are interested in economic development, business, industry and moneymaking; they are called vai\u015byas. And there is another class who are neither intelligent nor martially spirited nor endowed with the capacity for economic development but who simply can serve others. They are called \u015b\u016bdras, or the laborer class. This system is san\u0101tana \u2014 it comes from time immemorial, and it will continue in the same way. There is no power in the world which can stop it. Therefore, since this san\u0101tana-dharma system is eternal, one can elevate himself to the highest standard of spiritual life by following the Vedic principles. It is stated that formerly the sages followed this system; therefore to follow the Vedic system is to follow the standard etiquette of society. But the followers of Lord \u015aiva, who are drunkards, who are addicted to intoxicants and sex life, who do not bathe and who smoke g\u0101\u00f1j\u0101, are against all human etiquette. The conclusion is that persons who rebel against the Vedic principles are themselves the evidence that the Vedas are authoritative, because by not following the Vedic principles they become like animals. Such animalistic persons are themselves evidence of the supremacy of the Vedic regulations."

        "translation": "My dear Vidura, carrier of bows and arrows, all the demigods who were performing the sacrifice took their bath at the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamun\u0101 after completing the yaj\u00f1a performance. Such a bath is called avabh\u1e5btha-sn\u0101na. After thus becoming purified in heart, they departed for their respective abodes.",
        "purport": " After Lord \u015aiva and, previously, Dak\u1e63a left the arena of sacrifice, the sacrifice was not stopped; the sages went on for many years in order to satisfy the Supreme Lord. The sacrifice was not destroyed for want of \u015aiva and Dak\u1e63a, and the sages went on with their activities. In other words, it may be assumed that if one does not worship the demigods, even up to Lord \u015aiva and Brahm\u0101, one can nevertheless satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20). K\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante\u00a0\u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25: persons who are impelled by lust and desire go to the demigods to derive some material benefit. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 uses the very specific words n\u0101sti buddhi\u1e25, meaning \u201cpersons who have lost their sense or intelligence.\u201d Only such persons care for demigods and want to derive material benefit from them. Of course, this does not mean that one should not show respect to the demigods; but there is no need to worship them. One who is honest may be faithful to the government, but he does not need to bribe the government servants. Bribery is illegal; one does not bribe a government servant, but that does not mean that one does not show him respect. Similarly, one who engages in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord does not need to worship any demigod, nor does he have any tendency to show disrespect to the demigods. Elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.23) it is stated, ye\u00a0\u2019py anya-devat\u0101-bhakt\u0101 yajante \u015braddhay\u0101nvit\u0101\u1e25. The Lord says that anyone who worships the demigods is also worshiping Him, but he is worshiping avidhi-p\u016brvakam, which means \u201cwithout following the regulative principles.\u201d The regulative principle is to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Worship of demigods may indirectly be worship of the Personality of Godhead, but it is not regulated. By worshiping the Supreme Lord, one automatically serves all the demigods because they are parts and parcels of the whole. If one supplies water to the root of a tree, all the parts of the tree, such as the leaves and branches, are automatically satisfied, and if one supplies food to the stomach, all the limbs of the body \u2014 the hands, legs, fingers, etc. \u2014 are nourished. Thus by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead one can satisfy all the demigods, but by worshiping all the demigods one does not completely worship the Supreme Lord. Therefore worship of the demigods is irregular, and it is disrespectful to the scriptural injunctions. In this Age of Kali it is practically impossible to perform the deva-yaj\u00f1a, or sacrifices to the demigods. As such, in this age \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam recommends sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. Yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 11.5.32): \u201cIn this age the intelligent person completes the performances of all kinds of yaj\u00f1as simply by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare.\u201d Tasmin tu\u1e63\u1e6de jagat tu\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25: \u201cWhen Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is satisfied, all the demigods, who are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are satisfied.\u201d"
