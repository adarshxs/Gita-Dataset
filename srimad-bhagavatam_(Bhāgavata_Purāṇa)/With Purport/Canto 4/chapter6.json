But he said, \u201cIt is known that he is very easily satisfied, so let us try to satisfy him by falling at his lotus feet.\u201d Actually the position of the subordinate is always to surrender to the Supreme. That is the instruction of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord asks everyone to give up all kinds of concocted occupations and simply surrender unto Him. That will protect the conditioned souls from all sinful reactions. Similarly, in this case Brahm\u0101 also suggested that they go and surrender unto the lotus feet of Lord \u015aiva, for since he is very kind and easily satisfied, this action would prove effective."

        "purport": " It is understood that even the damsels of the heavenly planets are polluted by thoughts of sex enjoyment, and therefore they come in airplanes to bathe in the rivers Nand\u0101 and Alakanand\u0101. It is significant that these rivers, Nand\u0101 and Alakanand\u0101, are sanctified by the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, just as the Ganges is sacred because its water emanates from the toes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, so whenever water or anything is in touch with devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is purified and spiritualized. The rules and regulations of devotional service are based on this principle: anything in touch with the lotus feet of the Lord is immediately freed from all material contamination. The damsels of the heavenly planets, polluted by thoughts of sex life, come down to bathe in the sanctified rivers and enjoy sprinkling water on their husbands. Two words are very significant in this connection. Rati-kar\u015bit\u0101\u1e25 means that the damsels become morose after sex enjoyment. Although they accept sex enjoyment as a bodily demand, afterwards they are not happy. Another significant point is that Lord Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is described here as T\u012brthap\u0101da. T\u012brtha means \u201csanctified place,\u201d and p\u0101da means \u201cthe lotus feet of the Lord.\u201d People go to a sanctified place to free themselves from all sinful reactions. In other words, those who are devoted to the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, automatically become sanctified. The Lord\u2019s lotus feet are called t\u012brtha-p\u0101da because under their protection there are hundreds and thousands of saintly persons who sanctify the sacred places of pilgrimage. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a great \u0101c\u0101rya of the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava samprad\u0101ya, advises us not to travel to different places of pilgrimage. Undoubtedly it is troublesome to go from one place to another, but one who is intelligent can take shelter of the lotus feet of Govinda and thereby be automatically sanctified as the result of his pilgrimage. Anyone who is fixed in the service of the lotus feet of Govinda is called t\u012brtha-p\u0101da; he does not need to travel on various pilgrimages, for he can enjoy all the benefits of such travel simply by engaging in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. Such a pure devotee, who has implicit faith in the lotus feet of the Lord, can create sacred places in any part of the world where he decides to remain: t\u012brth\u012b-kurvanti t\u012brth\u0101ni (Bh\u0101g. 1.13.10). The places are sanctified due to the presence of pure devotees; any place automatically becomes a place of pilgrimage if either the Lord or His pure devotee remains or resides there. In other words, such a pure devotee, who is engaged one hundred percent in the service of the Lord, can remain anywhere in the universe, and that part of the universe immediately becomes a sacred place where he can peacefully render service to the Lord as the Lord desires."

The beautiful airplanes from the heavenly planets are compared here to the sky because they fly in the sky; the passengers are compared to the clouds. The beautiful damsels, the wives of the denizens of the heavenly planets, are compared to lightning. In summation, the airplanes with their passengers which came from higher planets to Kail\u0101sa were very pleasant to look at."

This tendency is present everywhere within this material world, not only on this earth but in higher planetary systems as well. In complete contrast with the influence of this atmosphere on the minds of the living entities within the material world is the description of the spiritual world. The women there are hundreds and thousands of times more beautiful than the women here in this material world, and the spiritual atmosphere is also many times better. Yet despite the pleasant atmosphere, the minds of the denizens do not become agitated because in the spiritual world, the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, the spiritualistic minds of the inhabitants are so much absorbed in the spiritual vibration of chanting the glories of the Lord that such enjoyment could not be surpassed by any other enjoyment, even sex, which is the culmination of all pleasure in the material world. In other words, in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world, in spite of its better atmosphere and facilities, there is no impetus for sex life. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.59), para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate: the inhabitants of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha are so spiritually enlightened that in the presence of such spirituality sex life is insignificant."

Yoga means meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and mah\u0101-yoga means those who engage in the devotional service of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Meditation means remembering, smara\u1e47am. There are nine different kinds of devotional service, of which smara\u1e47am is one process; the yog\u012b remembers the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u within his heart. Thus there were many devotees engaged in meditation on Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u under the big banyan tree. The Sanskrit word mah\u0101 is derived from the affix mahat. This affix is used when there is a great number or quantity, so mah\u0101-yoga indicates that there were many great yog\u012bs and devotees meditating on the form of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Generally such meditators are desirous of liberation from material bondage, and they are promoted to the spiritual world, to one of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas. Liberation means freedom from material bondage or nescience. In the material world we are suffering life after life because of our bodily identification, and liberation is freedom from that miserable condition of life."

It may be remembered that after their birth these Kum\u0101ras were requested by their father to get married and beget children in order to increase the population of the newly created universe. But they refused, and at that time Lord Brahm\u0101 was angry. In that angry mood, Rudra, or Lord \u015aiva, was born. Thus they were intimately related. Kuvera, the treasurer of the demigods, is fabulously rich. Thus Lord \u015aiva\u2019s association with the Kum\u0101ras and Kuvera indicates that he has all transcendental and material opulences. Actually, he is the qualitative incarnation of the Supreme Lord; therefore his position is very exalted."

        "translation": "All the sages and demigods, headed by Indra, offered their respectful obeisances unto Lord \u015aiva with folded hands. Lord \u015aiva was dressed in saffron garments and absorbed in trance, thus appearing to be the foremost of all sages.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word brahm\u0101nanda is significant. This brahm\u0101nanda, or brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a, is explained by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. When one is completely absorbed in the adhok\u1e63aja, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the sense perception of materialistic persons, one is situated in brahm\u0101nanda. It is impossible to conceive of the existence, name, form, quality and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He is transcendentally situated beyond the conception of materialistic persons. Because materialists cannot imagine or conceive of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they may think that God is dead, but factually He is always existing in His sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, His eternal form. Constant meditation concentrated on the form of the Lord is called sam\u0101dhi \u2014 ecstasy or trance. Sam\u0101dhi means particularly concentrated attention, so one who has achieved the qualification of always meditating on the Personality of Godhead is to be understood to be always in trance and enjoying brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a, or brahm\u0101nanda. Lord \u015aiva exhibited those symptoms, and therefore it is stated that he was absorbed in brahm\u0101nanda. Another significant word is yoga-kak\u1e63\u0101m. Yoga-kak\u1e63\u0101 is the sitting posture in which the left thigh is fixed under one\u2019s tightly knotted saffron-colored garment. Also the words man\u016bn\u0101m \u0101dyam are significant here because they mean a philosopher, or one who is thoughtful and can think very nicely. Such a man is called manu. Lord \u015aiva is described in this verse as the chief of all thinkers. Lord \u015aiva, of course, does not engage in useless mental speculation, but as stated in the previous verse, he is always thoughtful regarding how to deliver the demons from their fallen condition of life. It is said that during the advent of Lord Caitanya, Sad\u0101\u015biva appeared as Advaita Prabhu, and Advaita Prabhu\u2019s chief concern was to elevate the fallen conditioned souls to the platform of devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Since people were engaged in useless occupations which would continue their material existence, Lord \u015aiva, in the form of Lord Advaita, appealed to the Supreme Lord to appear as Lord Caitanya to deliver these illusioned souls. Actually Lord Caitanya appeared on the request of Lord Advaita. Similarly, Lord \u015aiva has a samprad\u0101ya, the Rudra samprad\u0101ya. He is always thinking about the deliverance of the fallen souls, as exhibited by Lord Advaita Prabhu."

        "purport": " Ka\u015byapa Muni was in the category of the living entities, but he had a transcendental son, V\u0101manadeva, who was an incarnation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Thus although Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He offered His respects to Ka\u015byapa Muni. Similarly, when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was a child He used to offer His respectful obeisances to His mother and father, Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101. Also, at the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a touched the feet of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira because the King was His elder. It appears, then, that the Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015aiva and other devotees, in spite of their being situated in exalted positions, instructed by practical example how to offer obeisances to their superiors. Lord \u015aiva offered his respectful obeisances to Brahm\u0101 because Brahm\u0101 was his father, just as Ka\u015byapa Muni was the father of V\u0101mana."

The mode of ignorance, or tamo-gu\u1e47a, is considered very much lower than the others, but in the higher sense it is also auspicious. The example may be given herein that the government has both an educational department and criminal department.

The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, as the intelligent class of men in society, must vow to steadily respect this regulative principle. The tendency in this Age of Kali to make a classless society and not observe the principles of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama is a manifestation of an impossible dream. Destruction of the social and spiritual orders will not bring fulfillment of the idea of a classless society. One should strictly observe the principles of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama for the satisfaction of the creator, for it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that the four orders of the social system \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras \u2014 are His creation.

The whole is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa, or universal form. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras are respectively the mouth, arms, abdomen and legs of the universal form of the Lord.

Similarly, for others, who are miscreants, you have destined different kinds of hells which are horrible and ghastly. Yet sometimes it is found that their destinations are just the opposite. It is very difficult to ascertain the cause of this.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called the supreme will. It is by the supreme will that everything is happening. It is said, therefore, that not a blade of grass moves without the supreme will. Generally it is prescribed that performers of pious activities are promoted to the higher planetary systems, devotees are promoted to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas, or spiritual worlds, and impersonal speculators are promoted to the impersonal Brahman effulgence; but it sometimes so happens that a miscreant like Aj\u0101mila is immediately promoted to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka simply by chanting the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Although when Aj\u0101mila uttered this vibration he intended to call his son N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a took it seriously and immediately gave him promotion to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, despite his background, which was full of sinful activities. Similarly King Dak\u1e63a was always engaged in the pious activities of performing sacrifices, yet simply because of creating a little misunderstanding with Lord \u015aiva, he was severely taken to task. The conclusion, therefore, is that the supreme will is the ultimate judgment; no one can argue upon this. A pure devotee therefore submits in all circumstances to the supreme will of the Lord, accepting it as all-auspicious. The purport of this verse is that when a devotee is in a calamitous condition he takes it as a benediction of the Supreme Lord and takes responsibility himself for his past misdeeds. In such a condition, he offers still more devotional service and is not disturbed. One who lives in such a disposition of mind, engaged in devotional service, is the most eligible candidate for promotion to the spiritual world. In other words, such a devotee\u2019s claim for promotion to the spiritual world is assured in all circumstances."

Since their hearts are always filled with anxiety, it is understood that they have already been killed by providence. Thus Lord \u015aiva, as a self-realized Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, was advised not to kill Dak\u1e63a. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is described as para-du\u1e25kha-du\u1e25kh\u012b because although he is never distressed in any condition of life, he is distressed to see others in a distressed condition. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, therefore, should not try to kill by any action of the body or mind but should try to revive the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness of others out of compassion for them. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has been started to deliver the envious persons of the world from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, and even though devotees are sometimes put into trouble, they push on the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement in all tolerance. Lord Caitanya advises: \u201cOne can chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking himself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than the tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.\u201d (\u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka 3) A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should follow the examples of such Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas as Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu and also Lord Jesus Christ. There is no need to kill anyone who has already been killed. But it should be noted herewith that a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should not tolerate the blaspheming of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, although he should tolerate personal insults to himself."

Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, for example, was unnecessarily cursed by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a boy, and this was very much regretted by the boy\u2019s father, but Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja accepted the curse and agreed to die within a week as the br\u0101hma\u1e47a boy desired. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the emperor and was full in power both spiritually and materially, but out of compassion and out of respect for the br\u0101hma\u1e47a community, he did not counteract the action of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a boy but agreed to die within seven days. Because it was desired by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja agree to the punishment so that the instruction of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam would thus be revealed to the world, Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was advised not to take action. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is personally tolerant for the benefit of others. When he does not show his prowess, this does not mean that he is lacking in strength; rather, it indicates that he is tolerant for the welfare of the entire human society."

        "translation": "O destroyer of the sacrifice, please take your portion of the sacrifice and let the sacrifice be completed by your grace.",
        "purport": " A sacrifice is a ceremony performed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, First Canto, Second Chapter, it is stated that everyone should try to understand whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by his activity. In other words, the aim of our activities should be to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as in an office it is the duty of the worker to see that the proprietor or the master is satisfied, so everyone\u2019s duty is to see whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by one\u2019s activity. Activities to satisfy the Supreme Godhead are prescribed in the Vedic literature, and execution of such activities is called yaj\u00f1a. In other words, acting on behalf of the Supreme Lord is called yaj\u00f1a. One should know very well that any activity besides yaj\u00f1a is the cause of material bondage. That is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9): yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25. Karma-bandhana\u1e25 means that if we do not work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, then the reaction of our work will bind us. One should not work for his own sense gratification. Everyone should work for the satisfaction of God. That is called yaj\u00f1a. After the yaj\u00f1a was performed by Dak\u1e63a, all the demigods expected pras\u0101da, the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Lord \u015aiva is one of the demigods, so naturally he also expected his share of the pras\u0101da from the yaj\u00f1a. But Dak\u1e63a, out of his envy of Lord \u015aiva, neither invited \u015aiva to participate in the yaj\u00f1a nor gave him his share after the offering. But after the destruction of the yaj\u00f1a arena by the followers of Lord \u015aiva, Lord Brahm\u0101 pacified him and assured him that he would get his share of pras\u0101da. Thus he was requested to rectify whatever destruction was caused by his followers. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.11) it is said that all the demigods are satisfied when one performs yaj\u00f1a. Because the demigods expect pras\u0101da from yaj\u00f1as, yaj\u00f1a must be performed. Those who engage in sense gratificatory, materialistic activities must perform yaj\u00f1a; otherwise they will be implicated. Thus Dak\u1e63a, being the father of mankind, was performing yaj\u00f1a, and Lord \u015aiva expected his share. But since \u015aiva was not invited, there was trouble. By the mediation of Lord Brahm\u0101, however, everything was settled satisfactorily. The performance of yaj\u00f1a is a very difficult task because all the demigods must be invited to participate in the yaj\u00f1a. In this Kali-yuga it is not possible to perform such costly sacrifices, nor is it possible to invite the demigods to participate. Therefore in this age it is recommended, yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 11.5.32). Those who are intelligent should know that in the Kali-yuga there is no possibility of performing the Vedic sacrifices. But unless one pleases the demigods, there will be no regulated seasonal activities or rainfall. Everything is controlled by the demigods. Under the circumstances, in this age, in order to keep the balance of social peace and prosperity, all intelligent men should execute the performance of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a by chanting the holy names Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. One should invite people, chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and then distribute pras\u0101da. This yaj\u00f1a will satisfy all the demigods, and thus there will be peace and prosperity in the world. Another difficulty in performing the Vedic rituals is that if one fails to satisfy even one demigod out of the many hundreds of thousands of demigods, just as Dak\u1e63a failed to satisfy Lord \u015aiva, there will be disaster. But in this age the performance of sacrifice has been simplified: one can chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and by pleasing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one can satisfy all the demigods automatically."
