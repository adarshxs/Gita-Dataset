The sons of the King also worshiped Lord \u015aiva with great devotion and respect. Finally, Lord \u015aiva became invisible to the princes.",
        "purport": " This chapter contains a great lesson concerning the monarchical kingdom in the days of yore. When King Barhi\u1e63at was considering retiring from the royal duties, he sent his sons to perform austerities in order to become perfect kings for the welfare of the citizens. At the same time, King Barhi\u1e63at was being instructed by the great sage N\u0101rada about the material world and the living entity who wants to enjoy it. It is therefore very clear how the kings and princes were trained to take charge of a kingdom. Welfare activities for the benefit of the citizens were aimed at understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The human form of life is especially meant for understanding God, our relationship with Him and our activities in His service. Because the kings took charge of the spiritual education of the citizens, both the king and the citizens were happy in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In this regard, we should remember that the monarchical hierarchy of Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at comes from Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva, a great devotee of the Lord and the most celebrated disciple of N\u0101rada Muni. King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at was then too much engaged in fruitive activities due to performing different types of yaj\u00f1as. One can actually be promoted to higher planetary systems or to the heavenly kingdoms by performing various yaj\u00f1as, but there is no question of liberation or going back home, back to Godhead. When the great sage N\u0101rada saw that a descendant of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva was being misled by fruitive activities, N\u0101rada took compassion upon him and personally came to instruct him about the ultimate benediction of life, bhakti-yoga. How N\u0101rada Muni indirectly introduced the bhakti-yoga system to King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at is very interestingly described in this Twenty-fifth Chapter."

Certain favorable conditions are created to enable them to live within water. In those days, however, people used to live for one hundred thousand years. Out of so many years, if one could spare ten thousand years for the sake of austerity, he would be assured of success in his future life. This was not very astonishing. Although such a feat is impossible in this age, it was quite possible in Satya-yuga."

        "purport": " As pointed out by Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, kaivalya, or merging into the Brahman effulgence, is just like going to hell. He similarly states that elevation to the upper planetary systems for the enjoyment of heavenly life is just so much phantasmagoria. This means that a devotee does not give any importance to the ultimate goal of the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs. The ultimate goal of the karm\u012bs is promotion to the heavenly kingdom, and the ultimate goal of the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs is merging into the Brahman effulgence. Of course, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are superior to the karm\u012bs, as confirmed by Lord Caitanya. Ko\u1e6di-karmani\u1e63\u1e6dha-madhye eka\u00a0\u2018j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b\u2019 \u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dha: \u201cOne j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, or impersonalist, is better than many thousands of fruitive actors.\u201d (Cc. Madhya 19.147) Therefore a devotee never enters upon the path of karma, or elevation by fruitive activities. N\u0101rada Muni took compassion upon King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at when he saw the King engaged in fruitive activity. In comparison to mundane workers, those who are trying to be elevated to the higher planetary systems by performing yaj\u00f1as are undoubtedly superior. In pure devotional service, however, both karma and j\u00f1\u0101na are considered bewildering features of the illusory energy."

The chief aim of life is to get rid of all miseries and enjoy happiness, but these two things cannot be realized by fruitive activity.",
        "purport": " In this material world there is a great illusion which covers real intelligence. A man in the mode of passion wants to work very hard to derive some benefit, but he does not know that time will never allow him to enjoy anything permanently. Compared with the work one expends, the gain is not so profitable. Even if it is profitable, it is not without its distresses. If a man is not born rich and he wants to purchase a house, cars and other material things, he has to work hard day and night for many years in order to possess them. Thus happiness is not attained without undergoing some distress. Actually, pure happiness cannot be had within this material world. If we wish to enjoy something, we must suffer for something else. On the whole, suffering is the nature of this material world, and whatever enjoyment we are trying to achieve is simply illusion. After all, we have to suffer the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. We may discover many fine medicines, but it is not possible to stop the sufferings of disease or death. Actually, medicine is not the counteracting agent for either disease or death. On the whole there is no happiness in this material world, but an illusioned person works very hard for so-called happiness. Indeed, this process of working hard is actually taken for happiness. This is called illusion. Therefore N\u0101rada Muni asked King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at what he desired to attain by performing so many costly sacrifices. Even if one attains a heavenly planet, he cannot avoid the distresses of birth, old age, disease and death. Someone may argue that even devotees have to undergo many distresses in executing austerities and penances connected with devotional service. Of course, for the neophytes the routine of devotional service may be very painful, but at least they have the hope that they will ultimately be able to avoid all kinds of distresses and achieve the highest perfectional stage of happiness. For the common karm\u012bs, there is no such hope because even if they are promoted to the higher planetary systems, they are not guaranteed freedom from the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. Even Lord Brahm\u0101, who is situated in the highest planetary system (Brahmaloka), has to die. Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s birth and death may be different from an ordinary man\u2019s, but within this material world he cannot avoid the distresses of birth, old age, disease and death. If one is at all serious about attaining liberation from these miseries, he must take to devotional service. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d Thus after attaining full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotee does not return to this material world after death. He goes back home, back to Godhead. That is the perfect stage of happiness, unblemished by any trace of distress."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012b Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has sung: As long as a person is entangled in fruitive activities, he is bound to accept one body after another. This is called karma-bandha-ph\u0101\u1e45sa, entanglement in fruitive activities. It does not matter whether one is engaged in pious or impious activities, for both are causes for further entanglement in material bodies. By pious activities one can take birth in a rich family and get a good education and a beautiful body, but this does not mean that the distresses of life are ultimately eliminated. In the Western countries it is not unusual for one to take birth in a rich aristocratic family, nor is it unusual for one to have a good education and a very beautiful body, but this does not mean that Westerners are free from the distresses of life. Although at the present moment the younger generation in Western countries has sufficient education, beauty and wealth, and although there is enough food, clothing, and facilities for sense gratification, they are in distress. Indeed, they are so distressed that they become hippies, and the laws of nature force them to accept a wretched life. Thus they go about unclean and without shelter or food, and they are forced to sleep in the street. It can be concluded that one cannot become happy by simply performing pious activities. It is not a fact that those who are born with a silver spoon in their mouth are free from the material miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. The conclusion is that one cannot be happy by simply executing pious or impious activities. Such activities simply cause entanglement and transmigration from one body to another. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura calls this karma-bandha-ph\u0101\u1e45sa. King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at admitted this fact and frankly asked N\u0101rada Muni how he could get out of this karma-bandha-ph\u0101\u1e45sa, entanglement in fruitive activities. This is actually the stage of knowledge indicated in the first verse of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra: ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101. When one actually reaches the platform of frustration in an attempt to discharge karma-bandha-ph\u0101\u1e45sa, he inquires about the real value of life, which is called brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101. In order to inquire about the ultimate goal of life, the Vedas (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 11.2.12) enjoin, tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet: \u201cIn order to understand the transcendental science, one must approach a bona fide spiritual master.\u201d King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at found the best spiritual master, N\u0101rada Muni, and he therefore asked him about that knowledge by which one can get out of the entanglement of karma-bandha-ph\u0101\u1e45sa, fruitive activities.

Without knowledge, one cannot become detached from material enjoyment, and without being detached from material enjoyment, one cannot make spiritual advancement.

It is said in the \u015b\u0101stras that by killing animals in a sacrifice, one immediately promotes them to human birth. Similarly, by killing their enemies on a battlefield, the k\u1e63atriyas who fight for a right cause are elevated to the heavenly planets after death. In Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that it is necessary for a king to execute a murderer so that the murderer will not suffer for his criminal actions in his next life. On the basis of such understanding, N\u0101rada Muni warns the King that the animals killed in sacrifices by the King await him at his death in order to avenge themselves. N\u0101rada Muni is not contradicting himself here. N\u0101rada Muni wanted to convince the King that overindulgence in animal sacrifice is risky because as soon as there is a small discrepancy in the execution of such a sacrifice, the slaughtered animal may not be promoted to a human form of life. Consequently, the person performing sacrifice will be responsible for the death of the animal, just as much as a murderer is responsible for killing another man. When animals are killed in a slaughterhouse, six people connected with the killing are responsible for the murder. The person who gives permission for the killing, the person who kills, the person who helps, the person who purchases the meat, the person who cooks the flesh and the person who eats it, all become entangled in the killing. N\u0101rada Muni wanted to draw the King\u2019s attention to this fact. Thus animal killing is not encouraged even in a sacrifice."

        "purport": " The great sage N\u0101rada Muni turned toward another topic, the history of King Pura\u00f1jana. This is nothing but the history of King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at told in a different way. In other words, this is an allegorical presentation. The word pura\u00f1-jana means \u201cone who enjoys in a body.\u201d This is clearly explained in the next few chapters. Because a person entangled in material activities wants to hear stories of material activities, N\u0101rada Muni turned to the topics of King Pura\u00f1jana, who is none other than King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at. N\u0101rada Muni did not directly deprecate the value of performing sacrifices in which animals are sacrificed. Lord Buddha, however, directly rejected all animal sacrifice. \u015ar\u012bla Jayadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated, nindasi yaj\u00f1a-vidher ahaha \u015bruti-j\u0101tam. The word \u015bruti-j\u0101tam indicates that in the Vedas animal sacrifice is recommended, but Lord Buddha directly denied Vedic authority in order to stop animal sacrifice. Consequently Lord Buddha is not accepted by the followers of the Vedas. Because he does not accept the authority of the Vedas, Lord Buddha is depicted as an agnostic or atheist. The great sage N\u0101rada cannot decry the authority of the Vedas, but he wanted to indicate to King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at that the path of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da is very difficult and risky. Foolish persons accept the difficult path of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da for the sake of sense enjoyment, and those who are too much attached to sense enjoyment are called m\u016b\u1e0dhas (rascals). It is very difficult for a m\u016b\u1e0dha to understand the ultimate goal of life. In the propagation of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, we actually see that many people are not attracted because they are m\u016b\u1e0dhas engaged in fruitive activity. It is said, upade\u015bo hi m\u016brkh\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 prakop\u0101ya na \u015b\u0101ntaye: if good instructions are given to a foolish rascal, he simply becomes angry and turns against the instructions instead of taking advantage of them. Because N\u0101rada Muni knew this very well, he indirectly instructed the King by giving him the history of his entire life. In order to wear a gold or diamond nose pin or earring, one has to pierce the ear or nose. Such pain endured for the sake of sense gratification is endured on the path of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, the path of fruitive activity. If one wishes to enjoy something in the future, he has to endure trouble in the present. If one wants to become a millionaire in the future and enjoy his riches, he has to work very hard at the present moment in order to accumulate money. This is karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bya. Those who are too much attached to such a path undergo the risk anyway. N\u0101rada Muni wanted to show King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at how one undergoes great troubles and miseries in order to engage in fruitive activity. A person who is very much attached to material activity is called vi\u1e63ay\u012b. A vi\u1e63ay\u012b is an enjoyer of vi\u1e63aya, which means eating, sleeping, mating and defending. N\u0101rada Muni is indirectly indicating through the story of King Pura\u00f1jana that eating, sleeping, mating and defending are troublesome and risky. The words itih\u0101sam, \u201chistory,\u201d and pur\u0101tanam, \u201cold,\u201d indicate that although a living entity lives within the material body, the history of the living entity within the material body is very old. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has sung, an\u0101di karama-phale, pa\u1e0di\u2019 bhav\u0101r\u1e47ava-jale, tarib\u0101re n\u0101 dekhi up\u0101ya: \u201cDue to my past fruitive activities I have fallen into the water of material existence, and I cannot find any way to get out of it.\u201d Every living entity is suffering in this material existence from past activities; therefore everyone has a very old history. Foolish material scientists have manufactured their own theories of evolution, which are simply concerned with the material body. But actually this is not the real evolution. The real evolution is the history of the living entity, who is pura\u00f1jana, \u201cliving within the body.\u201d \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni will explain this evolutionary theory in a different way for the understanding of sane persons."

        "translation": "My dear King, once in the past lived a king named Pura\u00f1jana, who was celebrated for his great activities. He had a friend named Avij\u00f1\u0101ta [\u201cthe unknown one\u201d]. No one could understand the activities of Avij\u00f1\u0101ta.",
        "purport": " Every living entity is pura\u00f1jana. The word puram means \u201cwithin this body, within this form,\u201d and jana means \u201cliving entity.\u201d Thus everyone is pura\u00f1jana. Every living entity is supposed to be the king of his body because the living entity is given full freedom to use his body as he likes. He usually engages his body for sense gratification, because one who is in the bodily conception of life feels that the ultimate goal of life is to serve the senses. This is the process of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. One who has no inner knowledge, who does not know that he is actually the spirit soul living within the body, who is simply enamored by the dictation of the senses, is called a materialist. A materialistic person interested in sense gratification can be called a pura\u00f1jana. Because such a materialistic person utilizes his senses according to his whims, he may also be called a king. An irresponsible king takes the royal position to be his personal property and misuses his treasury for sense gratification. The word b\u1e5bhac-chrav\u0101\u1e25 is also significant. The word \u015brava\u1e25 means \u201cfame.\u201d The living entity is famous from ancient times, for as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.20), na j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101: \u201cThe living entity is never born and never dies.\u201d Because he is eternal, his activities are eternal, although they are performed in different types of bodies. Na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre: \u201cHe does not die, even after the annihilation of the body.\u201d Thus the living entity transmigrates from one body to another and performs various activities. In each body the living entity performs so many acts. Sometimes he becomes a great hero \u2014 just like Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and Ka\u1e41sa or, in the modern age, Napoleon or Hitler. The activities of such men are certainly very great, but as soon as their bodies are finished, everything else is finished. Then they remain in name only. Therefore a living entity may be called b\u1e5bhac-chrav\u0101\u1e25; he may have a great reputation for various types of activities. Nonetheless, he has a friend whom he does not know. Materialistic persons do not understand that God is present as the Supersoul, who is situated within the heart of every living entity. Although the Param\u0101tm\u0101 sits beside the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 as a friend, the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101, or living entity, does not know it. Consequently he is described as avij\u00f1\u0101ta-sakh\u0101, meaning \u201cone who has an unknown friend.\u201d The word avij\u00f1\u0101ta-ce\u1e63\u1e6dita\u1e25 is also significant because a living entity works hard under the direction of the Param\u0101tm\u0101 and is carried away by the laws of nature. Nonetheless, he thinks himself independent of God and independent of the stringent laws of material nature. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.24): \u201cThis individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble and can be neither burned nor dried. He is everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same.\u201d The living entity is san\u0101tana, eternal. Because he cannot be killed by any weapon, burnt into ashes by fire, soaked or moistened by water, nor dried up by air, he is considered to be immune to material reactions. Although he is changing bodies, he is not affected by the material conditions. He is placed under the material conditions, and he acts according to the directions of his friend, the Supersoul. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): \u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\u201d Thus the Lord as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, and He gives directions to the living entity to act in whatever way the living entity desires. In this life and in his previous lives the living entity does not know that the Lord is giving him a chance to fulfill all kinds of desires. No one can fulfill any desire without the sanction of the Lord. All the facilities given by the Lord are unknown to the conditioned soul."

        "translation": "King Pura\u00f1jana began to search for a suitable place to live, and thus he traveled all over the world. Even after a great deal of traveling, he could not find a place just to his liking. Finally he became morose and disappointed.",
        "purport": " The travelings of Pura\u00f1jana are similar to the travelings of the modern hippies. Generally hippies are sons of great fathers and great families. It is not that they are always poor. But some way or another they abandon the shelter of their rich fathers and travel all over the world. As stated in this verse, the living entity wants to become a prabhu, or master. The word prabhu means \u201cmaster,\u201d but actually the living entity is not a master; he is the eternal servant of God. When the living entity abandons the shelter of God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and tries to become a prabhu independently, he travels all over the creation. There are 8,400,000 species of life and millions and millions and trillions of planets within the creation. The living entity wanders throughout these various types of bodies and throughout different planets, and thus he is like King Pura\u00f1jana, who traveled all over the world looking for a suitable place to live. \u015ar\u012b Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has sung, karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, kevala vi\u1e63era bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da: \u201cThe path of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da [fruitive activities] and the path of j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da [speculation] are just like strong pots of poison.\u201d Am\u1e5bta baliy\u0101 yeb\u0101 kh\u0101ya, n\u0101n\u0101 yoni sad\u0101 phire: \u201cA person who mistakes this poison to be nectar and drinks it travels in different species of life.\u201d Kadarya bhak\u1e63a\u1e47a kare: \u201cAnd, according to his body, he eats all types of abominable things.\u201d For instance, when the living entity is in the body of a hog, he eats stool. When the living entity is in the body of a crow, he eats all kinds of refuse, even pus and mucus, and enjoys it. Thus Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura points out that the living entity travels in different types of bodies and eats all kinds of abominable things. When he does not become ultimately happy, he becomes morose or takes to the ways of hippies. Thus in this verse it is said (na anur\u016bpam) that the King could never find a place suitable for his purposes. This is because in any form of life and on any planet in the material world, a living entity cannot be happy because everything in the material world is unsuitable for the spirit soul. As stated in this verse, the living entity independently wants to become a prabhu, but as soon as he gives up this idea and becomes a servant of God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his happiness immediately begins. Therefore \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura sings: \u201cMy dear living entity, why are you being carried away by the waves of m\u0101y\u0101?\u201d As stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61): \u201cThe Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine made of the material energy.\u201d The living entity is carried in the machine of the body through so many species of life on so many planets. Therefore Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura asks the living entity why he is being carried away in these bodily machines to be placed in so many different circumstances. He advises that one surmount the waves of m\u0101y\u0101 by surrendering unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: As soon as we confront K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises: \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\u201d (Bg. 18.66) Thus we are immediately relieved from traveling from one body to another and from one planet to another. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says, brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da bhramite kona bh\u0101gyav\u0101n j\u012bva (Cc. Madhya 19.151). If, while traveling, a living entity becomes fortunate enough to become blessed by the association of devotees and to come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his real life actually begins. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is giving all wandering living entities a chance to take to the shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thus become happy. In this verse the words viman\u0101 iva are very significant. In this material world even the great King of heaven is also full of anxiety. If even Lord Brahm\u0101 is full of anxiety, what of these ordinary living entities who are working within this planet? Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.16) confirms: \u201cFrom the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place.\u201d In the material world a living entity is never satisfied. Even in the position of Brahm\u0101 or in the position of Indra or Candra, one is full of anxiety simply because he has accepted this material world as a place of happiness."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vidy\u0101pati, a great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava poet, has sung: Material sense gratification, with society, friendship and love, is herein compared to a drop of water falling on a desert. A desert requires oceans of water to satisfy it, and if only a drop of water is supplied, what is its use? Similarly, the living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who, as stated in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, is \u0101nandamayo\u00a0\u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t, full of enjoyment. Being part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity is also seeking complete enjoyment. However, complete enjoyment cannot be achieved separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In his wanderings in the different species of life, the living entity may taste some type of enjoyment in one body or another, but full enjoyment of the senses cannot be obtained in any material body. Thus Pura\u00f1jana, the living entity, wanders in different types of bodies, but everywhere meets frustration in his attempt to enjoy. In other words, the spiritual spark covered by matter cannot fully enjoy the senses in any circumstance in material life. A deer may become absorbed in the musical sounds vibrated by the hunter, but the result is that it loses its life. Similarly, a fish is very expert in gratifying its tongue, but when it eats the bait offered by the fisherman, it loses its life. Even the elephant, who is so strong, is captured and loses its independence while satisfying its genitals with a female elephant. In each and every species of life, the living entity gets a body to satisfy various senses, but he cannot enjoy all his senses at one time. In the human form of life he gets an opportunity to enjoy all his senses pervertedly, but the result is that he becomes so harassed in his attempted sense gratification that he ultimately becomes morose. As he tries to satisfy his senses more and more, he becomes more and more entangled."

        "purport": " The tract of land south of the Him\u0101laya Mountains is the land of India, which was known as Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a. When a living entity takes birth in Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a he is considered to be most fortunate. Indeed, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has stated: Thus whoever takes birth in the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a attains all the facilities of life. He may take advantage of all these facilities for both material and spiritual advancement and thus make his life successful. After attaining the goal of life, one may distribute his knowledge and experience all over the world for humanitarian purposes. In other words, one who takes birth in the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a by virtue of his past pious activities gets full facility to develop the human form of life. In India, the climatic condition is such that one can live very peacefully without being disturbed by material conditions. Indeed, during the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira or Lord R\u0101macandra, people were free from all anxieties. There was not even extreme cold or extreme heat. The three kinds of miserable conditions \u2014 adhy\u0101tmika, adhibhautika and adhidaivika (miseries inflicted by the body and mind itself, those inflicted by other living entities, and natural disturbances) \u2014 were all absent during the reign of Lord R\u0101macandra or Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. But at present, compared to other countries on earth, India is artificially disturbed. Despite these material disturbances, however, the country\u2019s culture is such that one can easily attain the goal of life \u2014 namely salvation, or liberation from material bondage. Thus in order to take birth in India one must have performed many pious activities in a past life. In this verse the word lak\u1e63ita-lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101m indicates that the human body attained in Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a is very auspicious. Vedic culture is full of knowledge, and a person born in India can fully take advantage of Vedic cultural knowledge and the cultural system known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. Even at the present time, as we travel all over the world, we see that in some countries human beings have many material facilities but no facilities for spiritual advancement. We find everywhere the defects of one-sided facilities and a lack of full facilities. A blind man can walk but not see, and a lame man cannot walk but can see Following the logic called andha-pa\u1e45gu-ny\u0101ya, the blind man may take the lame man over his shoulder, and as the blind man walks the lame man may give him directions. Thus combined they may walk, but individually neither the blind man nor the lame man can walk successfully. Similarly, this human form of life is meant for the advancement of spiritual life and for keeping the material necessities in order. Especially in the Western countries there are ample facilities for material comforts, but no one has any idea of spiritual advancement. Many are hankering after spiritual advancement, but many cheaters come, take advantage of their money, bluff them and go away. Fortunately the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is there to give all facilities for both material and spiritual advancement. In this way people in the Western countries may take advantage of this movement. In India any man in the villages, unaffected by the industrial cities of India, can still live in any condition and make spiritual advancement. The body has been called the city of nine gates, and these nine gates include two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, one mouth, a genital organ and a rectum. When the nine gates are clean and working properly, it is to be understood that the body is healthy. In India these nine gates are kept clean by the villagers who rise early in the morning, bathe in the well or rivers, go to the temples to attend ma\u1e45gala-\u0101rati, chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra and take pras\u0101da. In this way one can take advantage of all the facilities of human life. We are gradually introducing this system in different centers in our Society in the Western countries. One who takes advantage of it becomes more and more enlightened in spiritual life. At the present moment, India may be compared to the lame man and the Western countries to the blind man. For the past two thousand years India has been subjugated by the rule of foreigners, and the legs of progress have been broken. In the Western countries the eyes of the people have become blind due to the dazzling glitter of material opulence. The blind man of the Western countries and the lame man of India should combine together in this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Then the lame man of India can walk with the help of the Westerner, and the blind Westerner can see with the help of the lame man. In short, the material advancement of the Western countries and the spiritual assets of India should combine for the elevation of all human society."

        "purport": " Since the body is a great city, there must be various arrangements such as lakes and gardens for sense enjoyment. Of the various parts of the body, those which incite sexual impulses are referred to here indirectly. Because the body has genitals, when the living entity attains the right age \u2014 be he man or woman \u2014 he becomes agitated by the sex impulse. As long as one remains a child, he is not agitated by seeing a beautiful woman. Although the sense organs are present, unless the age is ripe there is no sex impulse. The favorable conditions surrounding the sex impulse are compared here to a garden or a nice solitary park. When one sees the opposite sex, naturally the sex impulse increases. It is said that if a man in a solitary place does not become agitated upon seeing a woman, he is to be considered a brahmac\u0101r\u012b. But this practice is almost impossible. The sex impulse is so strong that even by seeing, touching or talking, coming into contact with, or even thinking of the opposite sex \u2014 even in so many subtle ways \u2014 one becomes sexually impelled. Consequently, a brahmac\u0101r\u012b or sanny\u0101s\u012b is prohibited to associate with women, especially in a secret place. The \u015b\u0101stras enjoin that one should not even talk to a woman in a secret place, even if she happens to be one\u2019s own daughter, sister or mother. The sex impulse is so strong that even if one is very learned, he becomes agitated in such circumstances. If this is the case, how can a young man in a nice park remain calm and quiet after seeing a beautiful young woman?"

        "purport": " The two breasts represent attachment and envy. The symptoms of r\u0101ga and dve\u1e63a (attachment and envy) are described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.34): \u201cAttraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings, but one should not fall under the control of senses and sense objects because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.\u201d These representatives of attachment and envy are very much unfavorable for advancement in spiritual life. One should not be attracted by the breasts of young women. The great saint \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya has described the breasts of women, especially young women, as nothing but a combination of muscles and blood, so one should not be attracted by the illusory energy of raised breasts with nipples. They are agents of m\u0101y\u0101 meant to victimize the opposite sex. Because the breasts are equally attractive, they are described as sama-v\u1e5bttau. The sex impulse remains in an old man\u2019s heart also, even up to the point of death. To be rid of such agitation, one must be very much advanced in spiritual consciousness, like Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, who said: \u201cSince I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste.\u201d When one is spiritually advanced he can no longer be attracted by the lumps of flesh and blood which are the breasts of young women. The word nirantarau is significant because although the breasts are situated in different locations, the action is the same. We should not make any distinction between attachment and envy. As described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.37), they are both products of rajo-gu\u1e47a (k\u0101ma e\u1e63a krodha e\u1e63a rajo-gu\u1e47a-samudbhava\u1e25). The word nig\u016bhant\u012bm, \u201ctrying to cover,\u201d indicates that even if one is tainted by k\u0101ma, lobha, krodha, etc., they can be transfigured by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In other words, one can utilize k\u0101ma (lust) for serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Being impelled by lust, an ordinary worker will work hard day and night; similarly a devotee can work hard day and night to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Just as karm\u012bs are working hard to satisfy k\u0101ma-krodha, a devotee should work in the same way to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, krodha (anger) can also be used in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when it is applied to the nondevotee demons. Hanum\u0101nj\u012b applied his anger in this way. He was a great devotee of Lord R\u0101macandra, and he utilized his anger to set fire to the kingdom of R\u0101va\u1e47a, a nondevotee demon. Thus k\u0101ma (lust) can be utilized to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and krodha (anger) can be utilized to punish the demons. When both are used for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, they lose their material significance and become spiritually important."

When she smiled shyly, she looked very beautiful to Pura\u00f1jana, who, although a hero, could not refrain from addressing her.",
        "purport": " Every living entity is a hero in two ways. When he is a victim of the illusory energy, he works as a great hero in the material world, as a great leader, politician, businessman, industrialist, etc., and his heroic activities contribute to the material advancement of civilization. One can also become a hero by being master of the senses, a gosv\u0101m\u012b. Material activities are false heroic activities, whereas restraining the senses from material engagement is great heroism. However great a hero one may be in the material world, he can be immediately conquered by the lumps of flesh and blood known as the breasts of women. In the history of material activities there are many examples, like the Roman hero Antony, who became captivated by the beauty of Cleopatra. Similarly, a great hero in India named Baji Rao became a victim of a woman during the time of Maharashtrian politics, and he was defeated. From history we understand that formerly politicians used to employ beautiful girls who were trained as vi\u1e63a-kany\u0101. These girls had poison injected into their bodies from the beginning of their lives so that in due course of time they would become so immune to the poison and so poisonous themselves that simply by kissing a person they could kill him. These poisonous girls were engaged to see an enemy and kill him with a kiss. Thus there are many instances in human history of heroes who have been curbed simply by women. Being part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the living entity is certainly a great hero, but due to his own weakness he becomes attracted to the material features. It is said in the Prema-vivarta that when a living entity wants to enjoy material nature, he is immediately victimized by the material energy. A living entity is not forced to come into the material world. He makes his own choice, being attracted by beautiful women. Every living entity has the freedom to be attracted by material nature or to stand as a hero and resist that attraction. It is simply a question of the living entity\u2019s being attracted or not being attracted. There is no question of his being forced to come into contact with material energy. One who can keep himself steady and resist the attraction of material nature is certainly a hero and deserves to be called a gosv\u0101m\u012b. Unless one is master of the senses, he cannot become a gosv\u0101m\u012b. The living entity can take one of two positions in this world: he may become a servant of his senses, or he may become master of them. By becoming a servant of the senses, one becomes a great material hero, and by becoming master of the senses, he becomes a gosv\u0101m\u012b, or spiritual hero."

        "purport": " The first aphorism in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra is ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101. In the human form of life one should put many questions to himself and to his intelligence. In the various forms of life lower than human life, the intelligence does not go beyond the range of life\u2019s primary necessities, namely eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Dogs, cats and tigers are always busy trying to find something to eat or a place to sleep, or trying to defend and have sexual intercourse successfully. In the human form of life, however, one should be intelligent enough to ask what he is, why he has come into the world, what his duty is, who is the supreme controller, what is the difference between dull matter and the living entity, etc. There are so many questions, and the person who is actually intelligent should simply inquire about the supreme source of everything: ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101. A living entity is always connected with a certain amount of intelligence, but in the human form of life the living entity must inquire about his spiritual identity. This is real human intelligence. It is said that one who is simply conscious of the body is no better than an animal, even though he be in the human form. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15) \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6do matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca: \u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\u201d In the animal form the living entity is completely forgetful of his relationship with God. This is called apohanam, or forgetfulness. In the human form of life, however, consciousness is more greatly developed, and consequently the human being has a chance to understand his relationship with God. In the human form one should utilize his intelligence by asking all these questions, just as Pura\u00f1jana, the living entity, is asking the unknown girl where she has come from, what her business is, why she is present, etc. These are inquiries about \u0101tma-tattva, self-realization. The conclusion is that unless a living entity is inquisitive about self-realization he is nothing but an animal."

Although you must be one of them, I see that you are loitering in this forest. Indeed, you are as silent as the great sages. Is it that you are searching after your own husband? Whoever your husband may be, simply by understanding that you are so faithful to him, he will come to possess all opulences. I think you must be the goddess of fortune, but I do not see the lotus flower in your hand. Therefore I am asking you where you have thrown that lotus.",
        "purport": " Everyone thinks that his intelligence is perfect. Sometimes one employs his intelligence in the worship of Um\u0101, the wife of Lord \u015aiva, in order to obtain a beautiful wife. Sometimes, when one wants to become as learned as Lord Brahm\u0101, he employs his intelligence in the worship of the goddess of learning, Sarasvat\u012b. Sometimes, when one wishes to become as opulent as Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he worships the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b. In this verse all these inquiries are made by King Pura\u00f1jana, the living entity who is bewildered and does not know how to employ his intelligence. Intelligence should be employed in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As soon as one uses his intelligence in this way, the goddess of fortune automatically becomes favorable to him. The goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, never remains without her husband, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Consequently, when one worships Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u he automatically obtains the favor of the goddess of fortune. One should not, like R\u0101va\u1e47a, worship the goddess of fortune alone, for she cannot remain long without her husband. Thus her other name is Ca\u00f1cal\u0101, or \u201crestless.\u201d In this verse it is clear that Pura\u00f1jana is representing our intelligence while he is talking with the girl. He not only appreciated the shyness of the girl but actually became more and more attracted by that shyness. He was actually thinking of becoming her husband and consequently was asking her whether she was thinking of her prospective husband or whether she was married. This is an example of bhoga-icch\u0101, the desire for enjoyment. One who is attracted by such desires becomes conditioned in this material world, and one who is not so attracted attains liberation. King Pura\u00f1jana was appreciating the beauty of the girl as if she were the goddess of fortune, but at the same time he was careful to understand that the goddess of fortune cannot be enjoyed by anyone except Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Since he doubted whether the girl was the goddess of fortune, he inquired about the lotus flower she was not holding. The material world is also the goddess of fortune because the material energy works under the direction of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram). The material world cannot be enjoyed by any living entity. If one so desires to enjoy it, he immediately becomes a demon like R\u0101va\u1e47a, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu or Ka\u1e41sa. Because R\u0101va\u1e47a wanted to enjoy the goddess of fortune, S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b, he was vanquished with all his family, wealth and opulence. One can, however, enjoy that m\u0101y\u0101 bestowed upon the living entity by Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The satisfaction of one\u2019s senses and desires means enjoying m\u0101y\u0101, not the goddess of fortune."

You should understand that I am a great hero and a very powerful king on this planet.",
        "purport": " There is a difference between demoniac mentality and devotional mentality. Devotees know perfectly well that the goddess of fortune, who is the constant companion of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, cannot be enjoyed by a living entity. This higher sense of understanding is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Nonetheless, everyone wants to become happy by imitating the prosperity of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. In this verse Pura\u00f1jana states that the girl appears to be an ordinary woman. However, since he is attracted by her, he requests that she become as happy as the goddess of fortune by associating with him. Thus he introduces himself as a great king with great influence so that she might accept him as her husband and be as happy as the goddess of fortune. To desire to enjoy this material world as a subordinate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is godly. The demons, however, want to enjoy this material world without considering the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the difference between a demon and a demigod. The word bhuvi-sp\u1e5bk mentioned in this verse is very significant. When the demigods sometimes come to this planet, they do not touch the ground. Pura\u00f1jana could understand that this girl did not belong to the transcendental world or the higher planetary system because her feet were touching the ground. Since every woman in this world wants her husband to be very influential, rich and powerful, Pura\u00f1jana, to seduce the girl, introduced himself as such a personality. In the material world, whether one be a man or a woman, one wants to enjoy. A man wants to enjoy a beautiful woman, and a woman wants to enjoy a powerful, opulent man. Every living entity who possesses such material desires is called puru\u1e63a, an enjoyer. Superficially it appears that the woman is the enjoyed and the man is the enjoyer, but internally everyone is an enjoyer. Consequently everything in this material world is called m\u0101y\u0101."

When thus attracted by the beauty of the material energy, one becomes very eager to enjoy. This is elaborately described in this instance of Pura\u00f1jana\u2019s becoming attracted by the beautiful woman. In conditional life the living entity is attracted by a face, eyebrows or eyes, a voice or anything. In short, everything becomes attractive. When a man or a woman is attracted by the opposite sex, it does not matter whether the opposite sex is beautiful or not. The lover sees everything beautiful in the face of the beloved and thus becomes attracted. This attraction causes the living entity to fall down in this material world. This is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.27): \u201cO scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate.\u201d This condition of life is called avidy\u0101. Opposed to this avidy\u0101 is real knowledge. \u015ar\u012b \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad distinguishes between vidy\u0101 and avidy\u0101, knowledge and ignorance. By avidy\u0101 (ignorance) one becomes conditioned, and by vidy\u0101 (knowledge) one becomes liberated. Pura\u00f1jana admits herein that he is attracted by avidy\u0101. Now he wishes to see the complete feature of avidy\u0101 and so requests the girl to raise her head so that he can see her face to face. He thus wishes to see the various features that make avidy\u0101 attractive."

He does not know why this material world was created, why others are working in this material world and what the ultimate source of this manifestation is. No one knows the answers to these questions, and this is called ignorance. By researching into the origin of life, important scientists are finding some chemical compositions or cellular combinations, but actually no one knows the original source of life within this material world. The phrase brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101 is used to indicate an inquisitiveness to know the original source of our existence in this material world. No philosopher, scientist or politician actually knows wherefrom we have come, why we are here struggling so hard for existence and where we will go. Generally people are of the opinion that we are all here accidentally and that as soon as these bodies are finished all our dramatic activities will be finished and we will become zero. Such scientists and philosophers are impersonalists and voidists. In this verse the girl is expressing the actual position of the living entity. She cannot tell Pura\u00f1jana her father\u2019s name because she does not know from where she has come. Nor does she know why she is present in that place. She frankly says that she does not know anything about all this. This is the position of the living entity in the material world. There are so many scientists, philosophers and big leaders, but they do not know wherefrom they have come, nor do they know why they are busy within this material world to obtain a position of so-called happiness. In this material world we have many nice facilities for living, but we are so foolish that we do not ask who has made this world habitable for us and has arranged it so nicely. Everything is functioning in order, but people foolishly think that they are produced by chance in this material world and that after death they will become zero.

She was obviously without full knowledge of her surrounding men and women and the snake. As stated before, the snake is the vital force of the living being. This vital force always remains awake even when the body and the senses become fatigued and do no work. Even in the state of unconsciousness, when we sleep, the snake, or the life force, remains intact and awake. Consequently we dream when we sleep. When the living entity gives up this material body, the vital force still remains intact and is carried to another material body. That is called transmigration, or change of the body, and we have come to know this process as death. Actually, there is no death. The vital force always exists with the soul, and when the soul is awakened from so-called sleep, he can see his eleven friends, or the active senses and the mind with their various desires (wives). The vital life force remains. Even during our sleeping hours we can understand by virtue of our breathing process that the snake lives by eating the air that passes within this body. Air is exhibited in the form of breathing, and as long as breath is there, one can understand that a sleeping man is alive. Even when the gross body is asleep the vital force remains active and alive to protect the body. Thus the snake is described as living and eating air to keep the body fit for life."

Combined, the living entity enjoys his material senses, and the intelligence supplies all paraphernalia for his enjoyment. As soon as he enters the human form, the living entity is entrapped by a family tradition, nationality, customs, etc. These are all supplied by the m\u0101y\u0101 of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus the living entity, under the bodily conception of life, utilizes his intelligence to his best capacity in order to satisfy his senses."

In the lower grades of life (in plant and tree life) there is no system for sexual intercourse. In the upper grades (in the life of birds and bees) there is sex, but the insects and animals do not know how to actually enjoy sex life. In the human form of life, however, there is full knowledge of how to enjoy sex. Indeed, there are many so-called philosophers who give directions on how to enjoy sex life. There is even a science called k\u0101ma-\u015b\u0101stra, which is the science of sex. In human life there are also such divisions as brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. There is no sex life except in the g\u1e5bhastha, or householder, \u0101\u015brama. The brahmac\u0101r\u012b is not allowed any sex, a v\u0101naprastha voluntarily refrains from sex, and the sanny\u0101s\u012b is completely renounced. The karm\u012bs do not practice brahmacarya, v\u0101naprastha or sanny\u0101sa life, for they are very much interested in g\u1e5bhastha life. In other words, a human being is very much materially inclined. Indeed, all living entities are materially inclined. They prefer g\u1e5bhastha life because there is a concession for sex. The karm\u012bs think the other statuses of life are worse than animal life, for animals also have sex whereas the brahmac\u0101r\u012b, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101s\u012b completely give up sex.

After that, one may desire liberation as well as material reputation. The householder can appreciate the results of sacrifices, which enable him to gain promotion to superior planetary systems. All this material happiness is practically unknown to the transcendentalists. They cannot even imagine such happiness.",
        "purport": " According to Vedic instructions, there are two paths for human activities. One is called prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga, and the other is called niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga. The basic principle for either of these paths is religious life. In animal life there is only prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga. Prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga means sense enjoyment, and niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga means spiritual advancement. In the life of animals and demons, there is no conception of niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga, nor is there any actual conception of prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga. Prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga maintains that even though one has the propensity for sense gratification, he can gratify his senses according to the directions of the Vedic injunctions. For example, everyone has the propensity for sex life, but in demoniac civilization sex is enjoyed without restriction. According to Vedic culture, sex is enjoyed under Vedic instructions. Thus the Vedas give direction to civilized human beings to enable them to satisfy their propensities for sense gratification. In the niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga, however, on the path of transcendental realization, sex is completely forbidden. The social orders are divided into four parts \u2014 brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa \u2014 and only in the householder life can the prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga be encouraged or accepted according to Vedic instructions. In the orders of brahmacarya, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa, there are no facilities for sex. In this verse the woman is advocating prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga only and is discouraging the path of niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga. She clearly says that the yatis, the transcendentalists, who are concerned only with spiritual life (kaivalya), cannot imagine the happiness of prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga. In other words, the man who follows the Vedic principles enjoys the materialistic way of life not only by becoming happy in this life, but also in the next life by being promoted to the heavenly planets. In this life such a person gets all kinds of material opulences, such as sons and grandsons, because he is always engaged in various religious functions. The material distresses are birth, old age, disease and death, but those who are interested in prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga hold various religious functions at the time of birth, old age, disease and death. Without caring for the distresses of birth, old age, disease and death, they are addicted to performing the special functions according to the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Factually, however, prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga is based on sex life. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (7.9.45), yan maithun\u0101di-g\u1e5bhamedhi-sukha\u1e41 hi tuccham. A householder who is too much addicted to prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga is actually called a g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b, not a g\u1e5bhastha. Although the g\u1e5bhastha desires sense gratification, he acts according to Vedic instructions. The g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b, however, who is interested only in sense gratification, does not follow any Vedic instruction. The g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b engages himself as an advocate of sex life and also allows his sons and daughters to engage in sex and to be deprived of any glorious end in life. A g\u1e5bhastha enjoys sex life in this life as well as in the next, but a g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b does not know what the next life is about because he is simply interested in sex in this life. On the whole, when one is too much inclined toward sex, he does not care for the transcendental spiritual life. In this Age of Kali especially, no one is interested in spiritual advancement. Even though it is sometimes found that one may be interested in spiritual advancement, he is most likely to accept a bogus method of spiritual life, being misguided by so many pretenders."

        "purport": " According to the Vedic system, when one is born in this material world he has many obligations. He has obligations to the demigods \u2014 the demigods of the sun and moon, King Indra, Varu\u1e47a, etc. \u2014 because they are supplying the necessities of life. We receive heat, light, water and all other natural amenities through the mercy of the demigods. We are also indebted to our forefathers, who have given us these bodies, paternal property, intelligence, society, friendship and love. Similarly, we are indebted to the general public for politics and sociology, and we are also indebted to lower animals such as horses, cows, asses, dogs and cats. In this way, as soon as one is born in this material world as a human being, he has so many obligations and is bound to repay all these obligations. If he does not repay them, he is further entangled in the process of birth and death. The g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b, however, who is overly addicted to material things, does not know that if he simply takes shelter at the lotus feet of Mukunda, he is immediately freed from all obligations to others. Unfortunately a g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b does not have any interest in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja says: A g\u1e5bha-vrata is the same as a g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b. One who takes sex life to be supreme finds action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness confusing. Either due to his own personal consideration or due to his having taken instructions from others or conferring with them, he becomes addicted to sexual indulgence and cannot act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Unless one becomes beautiful in the eyes of another, one cannot dedicate his whole life to another. The husband is considered very magnanimous because he gives as many children to the wife as she likes. Every woman is fond of children; therefore any husband who can please his wife by sex and give her children is considered very magnanimous. Not only does the husband become magnanimous by begetting children, but by giving his wife ornaments, nice food and dresses, he keeps her completely under submission. Such a satisfied wife will never give up the company of her husband. Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 recommends that to keep a wife satisfied a husband should give her some ornaments because women are generally fond of home, ornaments, dresses, children, etc. In this way the woman is the center of all material enjoyment. In this regard, the word vikhy\u0101tam is very significant. A man is always famous for his aggression toward a beautiful woman, and such aggression is sometimes considered rape. Although rape is not legally allowed, it is a fact that a woman likes a man who is very expert at rape."

        "purport": " When a husbandless woman is attacked by an aggressive man, she takes his action to be mercy. A woman is generally very much attracted by a man\u2019s long arms. A serpent\u2019s body is round, and it becomes narrower and thinner at the end. The beautiful arms of a man appear to a woman just like serpents, and she very much desires to be embraced by such arms. The word an\u0101tha-varg\u0101 is very significant in this verse. N\u0101tha means \u201chusband,\u201d and a means \u201cwithout.\u201d A young woman who has no husband is called an\u0101tha, meaning \u201cone who is not protected.\u201d As soon as a woman attains the age of puberty, she immediately becomes very much agitated by sexual desire. It is therefore the duty of the father to get his daughter married before she attains puberty. Otherwise she will be very much mortified by not having a husband. Anyone who satisfies her desire for sex at that age becomes a great object of satisfaction. It is a psychological fact that when a woman at the age of puberty meets a man and the man satisfies her sexually, she will love that man for the rest of her life, regardless who he is. Thus so-called love within this material world is nothing but sexual satisfaction."

In this verse life in the dream state is described, for the activities Pura\u00f1jana accomplished during the day were also reflected at night in the dream state. Pura\u00f1jana used to live with his wife for sense enjoyment, and at night this very sense enjoyment was appreciated in different ways. A man sleeps very soundly when he is greatly fatigued, and when a rich man is greatly fatigued he goes to his garden house with many female friends and there enters the water and enjoys their company. Such is the tendency of the living entity within this material world. A living entity is never satisfied with a woman unless he is trained in the system of brahmacarya. Generally a man\u2019s tendency is to enjoy many women, and even at the very end of life the sex impulse is so strong that even though one is very old he still wants to enjoy the company of young girls.

The system of opening different gates to different places is still evident in old Indian cities. Formerly a capital was surrounded by walls, and one passed through various gates to go to various cities or toward specific directions. In Old Delhi there are still remnants of surrounding walls and various gates known as the Kashmiri Gate, the Lahori Gate, etc. Similarly, in Ahmedabad there is a Delhi Gate. The point of this simile is that the living entity wants to enjoy different types of material opulences, and to this end nature has given him various holes in his body that he can utilize for sense enjoyment."

        "translation": "On the western side was a gate named \u0100sur\u012b. Through that gate King Pura\u00f1jana used to go to the city of Gr\u0101maka, accompanied by his friend Durmada.",
        "purport": " The gate on the western side of the city was known as \u0100sur\u012b because it was especially meant for the asuras. The word asura refers to those who are interested in sense gratification, specifically in sex life, to which they are overly attracted. Thus Pura\u00f1jana, the living entity, enjoys himself to his greatest satisfaction by means of the genitals. Consequently he used to go to the place known as Gr\u0101maka. Material sense gratification is also called gr\u0101mya, and the place where sex life is indulged in to a great extent is called Gr\u0101maka. When going to Gr\u0101maka, Pura\u00f1jana used to be accompanied by his friend Durmada. The word vi\u1e63aya refers to the four bodily necessities of life \u2014 eating, sleeping, mating and defending. The word durmadena may be analyzed in this way: dur means du\u1e63\u1e6da, or \u201csinful,\u201d and mada means \u201cmadness.\u201d Every living entity who is in contact with material nature is called mada, or mad. It is said: When a person is haunted, he becomes practically insane. When one is in an insane condition, he speaks all kinds of nonsense. Thus to become engaged in sense gratification, one has to accept a friend who is durmada, or badly affected by the material disease. The words \u0101sur\u012b n\u0101ma pa\u015bc\u0101d dv\u0101\u1e25 are significant in another sense. The sunrise is first visible from the eastern side \u2014 the Bay of Bengal \u2014 and gradually it progresses toward the west. It is practically experienced that people in the West are more addicted to sense gratification. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu Himself has certified, pa\u015bcimera loka saba m\u016b\u1e0dha an\u0101c\u0101ra (Cc. \u0100di 10.89): the more one goes to the western side, the more he will find people disinterested in spiritual life. He will find them behaving against the Vedic standards. Because of this, people living in the West are more addicted to sense gratification. In this Bh\u0101gavatam it is confirmed: \u0101sur\u012b n\u0101ma pa\u015bc\u0101d dv\u0101\u1e25. In other words, the population on the western side is interested in an asuric civilization, that is, a materialistic way of life. Lord Caitanya consequently wanted this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement to be preached on the western side of the world so that people addicted to sense gratification might be benefited by His teachings."

        "purport": " According to the Vedic conclusion, one\u2019s self is situated within the heart. As stated in Vedic language, h\u1e5bdy ayam \u0101tm\u0101 prati\u1e63\u1e6dhita\u1e25: the self is situated within the heart. In the material condition, however, the spirit soul is covered by the material qualities \u2014 namely goodness, passion and darkness \u2014 and within the heart these three qualities react. For instance, when one is in goodness, he feels happiness; when one is in passion, he feels satisfaction through material enjoyment; and when one is in darkness, he feels bewilderment. All these activities are of the mind, and they function on the platform of thinking, feeling and willing. When the living entity is encircled by wife, children and home, he acts on the mental plane. Sometimes he is very happy, sometimes he is very much satisfied, sometimes he is not satisfied, and sometimes he is bewildered. Bewilderment is called moha, illusion. Illusioned by society, friendship and love, the living entity thinks that his so-called society, friendship and love, nationality, community, etc., will give him protection. He does not know that after death he will be thrown into the hands of a very strong material nature that will force him to accept a certain type of body according to his present work. This body may not even be a human body. Thus the living entity\u2019s feeling of security in this life in the midst of society, wife and friendship is nothing but illusion. All living entities encaged in various material bodies are illusioned by the present activities of material enjoyment. They forget their real business, which is to go back home, back to Godhead. Everyone who is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness must be considered to be in illusion. One\u2019s so-called feelings of happiness and satisfaction resulting from material things are also illusions. Factually neither society, friendship, love nor anything else can save one from the onslaught of the external energy, which is symptomized by birth, death, old age and disease. To get even one living entity out of the illusory condition is very difficult; therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): \u201cThis divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.\u201d Therefore, unless one surrenders completely at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he cannot get out of the entanglement of the three modes of material nature."

In this way there will be no trouble in family life. Therefore for one\u2019s own social benefit, one is advised to keep his wife satisfied. In this way, when one becomes the servant of his wife, he must act according to the desires of his wife. Thus one becomes more and more entangled. In Bengal it is said that if one becomes an obedient servant of his wife, he loses all reputation. However, the difficulty is that unless one becomes a most obedient servant of his wife, family life becomes disturbed. In the Western countries this disturbance gives rise to the divorce law, and in Eastern countries like India there is separation. Now this disturbance is confirmed by the new introduction of the divorce law in India. Within the heart, the mind is acting, thinking, feeling and willing, and falling under the control of one\u2019s wife is the same as falling under the control of material intelligence. Thus one begets children by his wife and becomes entangled in so many activities under the control of mental concoctions."

        "translation": "When the Queen drank liquor, King Pura\u00f1jana also engaged in drinking. When the Queen dined, he used to dine with her, and when she chewed, King Pura\u00f1jana used to chew along with her. When the Queen sang, he also sang. Similarly, when the Queen cried, he also cried, and when the Queen laughed, he also laughed. When the Queen talked loosely, he also talked loosely, and when the Queen walked, the King walked behind her. When the Queen would stand still, the King would also stand still, and when the Queen would lie down in bed, he would also follow and lie down with her. When the Queen sat, he would also sit, and when the Queen heard something, he would follow her to hear the same thing. When the Queen saw something, the King would also look at it, and when the Queen smelled something, the King would follow her to smell the same thing. When the Queen touched something, the King would also touch it, and when the dear Queen was lamenting, the poor King also had to follow her in lamentation. In the same way, when the Queen felt enjoyment, he also enjoyed, and when the Queen was satisfied, the King also felt satisfaction.",
        "purport": " The mind is the place where the self is situated, and the mind is conducted by the intelligence. The living entity, situated within the heart, follows the intelligence. The intelligence is herein depicted as the Queen, and the soul, under mental control, follows the material intelligence just as the King follows his wife. The conclusion is that material intelligence is the cause of bondage for the living entity. The point is that one has to take to spiritual intelligence to come out of this entanglement. In the life of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, we find that the great Mah\u0101r\u0101ja first engaged his mind on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this way his intelligence became purified. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a also used his other senses in the service of the Lord. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity in the temple nicely decorated with flowers. He engaged his sense of smell by smelling the flowers, and he engaged his legs by walking to the temple. His hands were engaged in cleansing the temple, and his ears were engaged in hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His tongue was engaged in two ways: in speaking about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and in tasting pras\u0101da offered to the Deity. Materialistic persons, who are under the full control of material intelligence, cannot perform all these activities. Thus, consciously or unconsciously, they become entangled by the dictations of material intelligence. This fact is summarized in the following verse."

        "translation": "In this way, King Pura\u00f1jana was captivated by his nice wife and was thus cheated. Indeed, he became cheated in his whole existence in the material world. Even against that poor foolish King\u2019s desire, he remained under the control of his wife, just like a pet animal that dances according to the order of its master.",
        "purport": " The word vipralabdha\u1e25 is very significant in this verse. Vi means \u201cspecifically,\u201d and pralabdha means \u201cobtained.\u201d Just to satisfy his desires, the King got the Queen, and thus he became cheated by material existence. Although he was not willing to do so, he remained a pet animal under the control of material intelligence. Just as a pet monkey dances according to the desires of its master, the King danced according to the desires of the Queen. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.2) it is said, mahat-sev\u0101\u1e41 dv\u0101ram \u0101hur vimukte\u1e25: if one associates with a saintly person, a devotee, one\u2019s path of liberation becomes clear. But if one associates with a woman or with a person who is too much addicted to a woman, his path of bondage becomes completely clear. On the whole, for spiritual advancement one must give up the company of women. This is what is meant by the order of sanny\u0101sa, the renounced order. Before taking sanny\u0101sa, or completely renouncing the material world, one has to practice avoiding illicit sex. Sex life, licit or illicit, is practically the same, but through illicit sex one becomes more and more captivated. By regulating one\u2019s sex life there is a chance that one may eventually be able to renounce sex or renounce the association of women. If this can be done, advancement in spiritual life comes very easily. How one becomes captivated by the association of one\u2019s dear wife is explained in this chapter by N\u0101rada Muni. Attraction for one\u2019s wife means attraction for the material qualities. One who is attracted by the material quality of darkness is in the lowest stage of life, whereas one who is attracted by the material quality of goodness is in a better position. Sometimes we see that when a person is on the platform of material goodness, he is attracted more or less by the cultivation of knowledge. This is, of course, a better position, for knowledge gives one the preference to accept devotional service. Unless one comes to the platform of knowledge, the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, one cannot advance in devotional service. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): \u201cOne who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\u201d The platform of knowledge is advantageous because it is a means by which one may come to the stage of devotional service. However, if one takes to devotional service directly, knowledge is revealed without separate endeavor. This is confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.7): Devotional service automatically reveals actual knowledge of our material existence. One who is sufficiently intelligent immediately attains the stage of renunciation of so-called society, family and love as well as other things. As long as we are attached to society, family and love of the material world, there is no question of knowledge. Nor is there a question of devotional service. By directly taking to devotional service, however, one becomes filled with knowledge and renunciation. In this way one\u2019s life becomes successful."
