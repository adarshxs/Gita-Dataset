        "purport": " There are four Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava samprad\u0101yas (systems) of disciplic succession. One samprad\u0101ya comes from Lord Brahm\u0101, one from the goddess of fortune, one from the Kum\u0101ras, headed by Sanat-kum\u0101ra, and one from Lord \u015aiva. These four systems of disciplic succession are still going on. As King P\u1e5bthu has illustrated, one who is serious about receiving transcendental Vedic knowledge must accept a guru, or spiritual master, in one of these four disciplic successions. It is said that unless one accepts a mantra from one of these samprad\u0101yas, the so-called mantra will not act in Kali-yuga. Many samprad\u0101yas have sprung up without authority, and they are misleading the people by giving unauthorized mantras. The rascals of these so-called samprad\u0101yas do not observe the Vedic rules and regulations. Although they are addicted to all kinds of sinful activities, they still offer the people mantras and thus mislead them. Intelligent persons, however, know that such mantras will never be successful, and as such they never patronize such upstart spiritual groups. People should be very careful of these nonsensical samprad\u0101yas. To get some facility for sense gratification, unfortunate people in this age receive mantras from these so-called samprad\u0101yas. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, showed by his example that one should receive knowledge from a bona fide samprad\u0101ya. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu accepted Sanat-kum\u0101ra as his spiritual master."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also known as avat\u0101r\u012b, which means \u201cone from whom all the incarnations emanate.\u201d In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhavo matta\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 pravartate: \u201cI am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.\u201d Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of everyone\u2019s appearance. As far as this material world is concerned, Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Lord \u015aiva are all emanations from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These three incarnations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are called gu\u1e47a-avat\u0101ras. The material world is governed by three material modes of nature, and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva respectively take charge of the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu is also an incarnation of those qualities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by which one rules over conditioned souls. In this verse the word adhok\u1e63aja, meaning \u201cbeyond the perception of the material senses,\u201d is very significant. No one can perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead by mental speculation; therefore a person with a poor fund of knowledge cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since one can form only an impersonal idea on the strength of one\u2019s material senses, the Lord is known as Adhok\u1e63aja."

That is the nature of spiritual talks. We have actually seen that one can never become satiated by hearing the conversations between Vidura and Maitreya. Both of them are devotees, and the more Vidura inquires, the more Maitreya is encouraged to speak. A symptom of spiritual talks is that no one feels tired. Thus upon hearing the questions of Vidura, the great sage Maitreya did not feel disgusted but rather felt encouraged to speak at greater length."

The citizens actually became skinny due to starvation. Therefore they came before the King and informed him of their real situation.",
        "purport": " Information is given herein concerning the selection of the king by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. According to the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are considered to be the head of the society and therefore to be situated in the topmost social position. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, the institution of four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas, is very scientifically designed. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma is not a man-made institution, but is God-made. In this narration it is clearly indicated that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as used to control the royal power. When an evil king like Vena ruled, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as would kill him through their brahminical powers and would select a proper ruler by testing his qualifications. In other words, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the intelligent men or great sages, would control the monarchical powers. Here we have an indication of how the br\u0101hma\u1e47as elected King P\u1e5bthu to the throne as the protector of the citizens. The citizens, being skinny due to hunger, approached the King and informed him that necessary action should be taken. The structure of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma was so nice that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as would guide the head of state. The head of state would then give protection to the citizens. The k\u1e63atriyas would take charge of protecting the people in general, and under the protection of the k\u1e63atriyas, the vai\u015byas would protect the cows, produce food grains and distribute them. \u015a\u016bdras, the working class, would help the higher three classes by manual labor. This is the perfect social system."

It is here indicated that in a rare circumstance when there is no supply of grains, the government may sanction the eating of meat. However, when there is sufficient food, the government should not allow the eating of cow\u2019s flesh just to satisfy the fastidious tongue. In other words, in rare circumstances, when people are suffering for want of grains, meat-eating or flesh-eating can be allowed, but not otherwise. The maintenance of slaughterhouses for the satisfaction of the tongue and the killing of animals unnecessarily should never be sanctioned by a government. As described in a previous verse, cows and other animals should be given sufficient grass to eat. If despite a sufficient supply of grass a cow does not supply milk, and if there is an acute shortage of food, the dried-up cow may be utilized to feed the hungry masses of people. According to the law of necessity, first of all human society must try to produce food grains and vegetables, but if they fail in this, they can indulge in flesh-eating. Otherwise not. As human society is presently structured, there is sufficient production of grains all over the world. Therefore the opening of slaughterhouses cannot be supported. In some nations there is so much surplus grain that sometimes extra grain is thrown into the sea, and sometimes the government forbids further production of grain. The conclusion is that the earth produces sufficient grain to feed the entire population, but the distribution of this grain is restricted due to trade regulations and a desire for profit. Consequently in some places there is scarcity of grain and in others profuse production. If there were one government on the surface of the earth to handle the distribution of grain, there would be no question of scarcity, no necessity to open slaughterhouses, and no need to present false theories about overpopulation."

        "translation": "The planet earth spoke: My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are transcendental in Your position, and by Your material energy You have expanded Yourself in various forms and species of life through the interaction of the three modes of material nature. Unlike some other masters, You always remain in Your transcendental position and are not affected by the material creation, which is subject to different material interactions. Consequently You are not bewildered by material activities.",
        "purport": " After King P\u1e5bthu gave his royal command, the planet earth in the shape of a cow could understand that the King was a directly empowered incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently the King knew everything \u2014 past, present and future. Thus there was no possibility of the earth\u2019s cheating him. The earth was accused of hiding the seeds of all herbs and grains, and therefore she is preparing to explain how the seeds of these herbs and grains can be again exposed. The earth knew that the King was very angry with her, and she realized that unless she pacified his anger, there was no possibility of placing a positive program before him. Therefore in the beginning of her speech she very humbly presents herself as a part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s body. She submits that the various bodily forms manifest in the physical world are but different parts and parcels of the supreme gigantic body. It is said that the lower planetary systems are parts and parcels of the legs of the Lord, whereas the upper planetary systems are parts and parcels of the Lord\u2019s head. The Lord creates this material world by His external energy, but this external energy is in one sense not different from Him. Yet at the same time the Lord is not directly manifest in the external energy but is always situated in the spiritual energy. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10), may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25: material nature is working under the direction of the Lord. Therefore the Lord is not unattached to the external energy, and He is addressed in this verse as gu\u1e47a-\u0101tm\u0101, the source of the three modes of material nature. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.15), nirgu\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-bhokt\u1e5b ca: although the Lord is not attached to the external energy, He is nonetheless the master of it. The philosophy of Lord Caitanya, upholding that the Lord is simultaneously one with and different from His creation (acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva), is very easily understandable in this connection. The planet earth explains that although the Lord is attached to the external energy, He is nirdhuta; He is completely free from the activities of the external energy. The Lord is always situated in His internal energy. Therefore in this verse it is stated: svar\u016bpa-anubhavena. The Lord remains completely in His internal potency and yet has full knowledge of the external energy as well as the internal energy, just as His devotee remains always in a transcendental position, keeping himself in the service of the Lord without becoming attached to the material body. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that the devotee who is always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is always liberated, regardless of his material situation. If it is possible for a devotee to remain transcendental, it is certainly possible for the Supreme Personality of Godhead to remain in His internal potency without being attached to the external potency. There should be no difficulty in understanding this situation. Just as a devotee is never bewildered by his material body, the Lord is never bewildered by the external energy of this material world. A devotee is not hampered by the material body, although he is situated in a physical body that runs according to so many material conditions. (For example, there are five kinds of air functioning within the body, and there are so many organs \u2014 the hands, legs, tongue, genitals, rectum, etc. \u2014 all working differently.) The spirit soul, the living entity, who is in full knowledge of his position is always engaged in chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare and is not concerned with the bodily functions. Although the Lord is connected with the material world, He is always situated in His spiritual energy and is always unattached to the functions of the material world. As far as the material body is concerned, there are six \u201cwaves,\u201d or symptomatic material conditions: hunger, thirst, lamentation, bewilderment, old age and death. The liberated soul is never concerned with these six physical interactions. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being the all-powerful master of all energies, has some connection with the external energy, but He is always free from the interactions of the external energy in the material world."

Although He once saved the earth, He now wants to upset the earth, which is like a boat on water. No one can understand the activities of the Lord. Due to a poor fund of knowledge, human beings sometimes think the Lord\u2019s activities contradictory."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, I am also the creation of one of Your energies, composed of the three modes of material nature. Consequently I am bewildered by Your activities. Even the activities of Your devotees cannot be understood, and what to speak of Your pastimes. Thus everything appears to us to be contradictory and wonderful.",
        "purport": " The activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His various forms and incarnations are always uncommon and wonderful. It is not possible for a tiny human being to estimate the purpose and plans of such activities; therefore \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has said that unless the Lord\u2019s activities are accepted as inconceivable, they cannot be explained. The Lord is eternally existing as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He has also simultaneously expanded Himself in innumerable forms, beginning with Lord R\u0101ma, Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Lord Var\u0101ha and all the incarnations coming directly from Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a is the expansion of Baladeva, and Baladeva is the first manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore all these incarnations are known as kal\u0101. The word \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101m refers to all the Personalities of Godhead. As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.39), r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is confirmed that all the incarnations are partial expansions, or kal\u0101, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should not take the plural number of the word \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101m to mean that there are many Godheads. The fact is that God is one, but He exists eternally and expands Himself in innumerable forms and acts in various ways. Sometimes the common man is bewildered by all this and considers such activities contradictory, but they are not contradictory. There is a great plan behind all the Lord\u2019s activities. For our understanding it is sometimes said that the Lord is situated in the heart of the thief as well as in the heart of the householder, and that the Supersoul in the heart of the thief dictates, \u201cGo and steal things from that particular house,\u201d and at the same time the Lord tells the householder, \u201cNow be careful of thieves and burglars.\u201d These instructions to different persons appear contradictory, yet we should know that the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has some plan, and we should not consider such activities contradictory. The best course is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead wholeheartedly and, being protected by Him, remain peaceful."
