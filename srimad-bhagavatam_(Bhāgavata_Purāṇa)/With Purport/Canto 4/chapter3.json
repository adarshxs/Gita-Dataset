        "purport": " The previous chapter has already explained that Vidura questioned the sage Maitreya as to the cause of the misunderstanding between Lord \u015aiva and Dak\u1e63a. Another question is why the strife between Dak\u1e63a and his son-in-law caused Sat\u012b to destroy her body. The chief reason for Sat\u012b\u2019s giving up her body was that her father, Dak\u1e63a, began another sacrificial performance, to which Lord \u015aiva was not invited at all. Generally, when any sacrifice is performed, although each and every sacrifice is intended to pacify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, all the demigods, especially Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva and the other principal demigods, such as Indra and Candra, are invited, and they take part. It is said that unless all the demigods are present, no sacrifice is complete. But in the tension between the father-in-law and son-in-law, Dak\u1e63a began another yaj\u00f1a performance, to which Lord \u015aiva was not invited. Dak\u1e63a was the chief progenitor employed by Lord Brahm\u0101, and he was a son of Brahm\u0101, so he had a high position and was also very proud."

        "purport": " In the Vedas it is prescribed that before performing a b\u1e5bhaspati-sava sacrifice, one should perform the sacrifice named v\u0101japeya. While performing these sacrifices, however, Dak\u1e63a neglected great devotees like Lord \u015aiva. According to Vedic scriptures, the demigods are eligible to participate in yaj\u00f1as and share the oblations, but Dak\u1e63a wanted to avoid them. All sacrifices are intended to pacify Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u includes all His devotees. Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and the other demigods are all obedient servants of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; therefore Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is never satisfied without them. But Dak\u1e63a, being puffed up with his power, wanted to deprive Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva of participation in the sacrifice, understanding that if one satisfies Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it is not necessary to satisfy His followers. But that is not the process. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u wants His followers to be satisfied first. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, mad-bhakta-p\u016bj\u0101bhyadhik\u0101: \u201cThe worship of My devotees is better than worship of Me.\u201d Similarly, in the \u015aiva Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is stated that the best mode of worship is to offer oblations to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but better than that is to worship the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus Dak\u1e63a\u2019s determination to neglect Lord \u015aiva in the sacrifices was not fitting."

        "purport": " It appears that the residence of Lord \u015aiva was not on this planet but somewhere in outer space; otherwise how could Sat\u012b have seen the airplanes coming from different directions towards this planet and heard the passengers talking about the great sacrifice being performed by Dak\u1e63a? Sat\u012b is described here as D\u0101k\u1e63\u0101ya\u1e47\u012b because she was the daughter of Dak\u1e63a. The mention of upadeva-vara refers to inferior demigods like the Gandharvas, Kinnaras and Uragas, who are not exactly demigods but between the demigods and human beings. They were also coming in planes. The word sva-nilay\u0101bhy\u0101\u015be indicates that they were passing right near her residential quarters. The dress and bodily features of the wives of the heavenly denizens are very nicely described here. Their eyes moved, their earrings and other ornaments glittered and glared, their dresses were the nicest possible, and all of them had special lockets on their necklaces. Each woman was accompanied by her husband. Thus they looked so beautiful that Sat\u012b, D\u0101k\u1e63\u0101ya\u1e47\u012b, was impelled to dress similarly and go to the sacrifice with her husband. That is the natural inclination of a woman."

        "purport": " It is a woman\u2019s nature to want to decorate herself with ornaments and nice dresses and accompany her husband to social functions, meet friends and relatives, and enjoy life in that way. This propensity is not unusual, for woman is the basic principle of material enjoyment. Therefore in Sanskrit the word for woman is str\u012b, which means \u201cone who expands the field of material enjoyment.\u201d In the material world there is an attraction between woman and man. This is the arrangement of conditional life. A woman attracts a man, and in that way the scope of material activities, involving house, wealth, children and friendship, increases, and thus instead of decreasing one\u2019s material demands, one becomes entangled in material enjoyment. Lord \u015aiva, however, is different; therefore his name is \u015aiva. He is not at all attracted by material enjoyment, although his wife, Sat\u012b, was the daughter of a very great leader and was given to him by the request of Brahm\u0101. Lord \u015aiva was reluctant, but Sat\u012b, as a woman, the daughter of a king, wanted enjoyment. She wanted to go to her father\u2019s house, just as her other sisters might have done, and meet them and enjoy social life. Here, she specifically indicated that she would decorate herself with the ornaments given by her father. She did not say that she would decorate herself with the ornaments given by her husband because her husband was callous about all such matters. He did not know how to decorate his wife and take part in social life because he was always in ecstasy with thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to the Vedic system, a daughter is given a sufficient dowry at the time of her marriage, and therefore Sat\u012b was also given a dowry by her father, and ornaments were included. It is also the custom that the husband gives some ornaments, but here it is particularly mentioned that her husband, being materially almost nothing, could not do so; therefore she wanted to decorate herself with the ornaments given by her father. It was fortunate for Sat\u012b that Lord \u015aiva did not take the ornaments from his wife and spend them for g\u0101\u00f1j\u0101, because those who imitate Lord \u015aiva in smoking g\u0101\u00f1j\u0101 exploit everything from household affairs; they take all of their wives\u2019 property and spend on smoking, intoxication and similar other activities."

Therefore she addressed her husband as aja, which refers to one who has transcended the bondage of birth and death, or one who has realized his eternal position. She stated, \u201cThe illusion of accepting the perverted reflection, the material or cosmic manifestation, to be real is not present in you, because you are self-realized. For you the attraction of social life and the consideration that someone is father, someone is mother and someone is sister, which are illusory relationships, is already over; but because I am a poor woman, I am not so advanced in transcendental realization. Therefore naturally these appear to me as real.\u201d Only less intelligent persons accept this perverted reflection of the spiritual world to be real. Those who are under the spell of the external energy accept this manifestation to be fact, whereas those who are advanced in spiritual realization know that it is illusion. Actual reality is elsewhere, in the spiritual world. \u201cBut as far as I am concerned,\u201d Sat\u012b said, \u201cI do not have much knowledge about self-realization. I am poor because I do not know the actual facts. I am attracted by my birthplace, and I want to see it.\u201d One who has attraction for his birthplace, for his body and for other such items mentioned in the Bh\u0101gavatam is considered to be like an ass or a cow. Sat\u012b might have heard all this many times from her husband, Lord \u015aiva, but because she was a woman, yo\u1e63it, she still hankered after the same material objects of affection. The word yo\u1e63it means \u201cone who is enjoyed.\u201d Therefore woman is called yo\u1e63it. In spiritual advancement, association with yo\u1e63it is always restricted because if one is like a play doll in the hands of yo\u1e63it, then all his spiritual advancement is at once stopped.

When Lord \u015aiva is addressed here as abhava, this may be taken to mean \u201cone who has never felt material miseries.\u201d Sat\u012b wanted to impress upon her husband that even those who were not related to her father were also going, to say nothing of herself, who was intimately related with him. Lord \u015aiva is addressed here as blue-throated. Lord \u015aiva drank an ocean of poison and kept it in his throat, not swallowing it or allowing it to go down to his stomach, and thus his throat became blue. Since then he has been known as n\u012blaka\u1e47\u1e6dha, or blue-throated. The reason that Lord \u015aiva drank an ocean of poison was for others\u2019 benefit. When the ocean was churned by the demigods and the demons, the churning at first produced poison, so because the poisonous ocean might have affected others who were not so advanced, Lord \u015aiva drank all the ocean water. In other words, he could drink such a great amount of poison for others\u2019 benefit, and now, since his wife was personally requesting him to go to her father\u2019s house, even if he did not wish to give that permission, he should do so out of his great kindness."

        "translation": "The great sage Maitreya said: Lord \u015aiva, the deliverer of the hill Kail\u0101sa, having thus been addressed by his dear wife, replied smilingly, although at the same time he remembered the malicious, heart-piercing speeches delivered by Dak\u1e63a before the guardians of the universal affairs.",
        "purport": " When Lord \u015aiva heard from his wife about Dak\u1e63a, the psychological effect was that he immediately remembered the strong words spoken against him in the assembly of the guardians of the universe, and, remembering those words, he was sorry at heart, although to please his wife he smiled. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that a liberated person is always in mental equilibrium in both the distress and the happiness of this material world. Therefore the question may now be raised why a liberated personality like Lord \u015aiva was so unhappy because of the words of Dak\u1e63a. The answer is given by \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura: Lord \u015aiva is \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma, or situated in complete self-realization, but because he is the incarnation in charge of the material mode of ignorance, tamo-gu\u1e47a, he is sometimes affected by the pleasure and pain of the material world. The difference between the pleasure and pain of this material world and that of the spiritual world is that in the spiritual world the effect is qualitatively absolute. Therefore one may feel sorry in the absolute world, but the manifestation of so-called pain is always full of bliss. For instance, once Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in His childhood, was chastised by His mother, Ya\u015bod\u0101, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cried. But although He shed tears from His eyes, this is not to be considered a reaction of the mode of ignorance, for the incident was full of transcendental pleasure. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was playing in so many ways, sometimes it appeared that He caused distress to the gop\u012bs, but actually such dealings were full of transcendental bliss. That is the difference between the material and spiritual worlds. The spiritual world, where everything is pure, is pervertedly reflected in this material world. Since everything in the spiritual world is absolute, in the spiritual varieties of apparent pleasure and pain there is no perception other than eternal bliss, whereas in the material world, because everything is contaminated by the modes of material nature, there are feelings of pleasure and pain. Therefore because Lord \u015aiva, although a fully self-realized person, was in charge of the material mode of ignorance, he felt sorrow."

        "purport": " It may be argued that since Dak\u1e63a was very learned, wealthy and austere and had descended from a very exalted heritage, how could he be unnecessarily angry towards another? The answer is that when the qualities of good education, good parentage, beauty and sufficient wealth are misplaced in a person who is puffed up by all these possessions, they produce a very bad result. Milk is a very nice food, but when milk is touched by an envious serpent it becomes poisonous. Similarly, material assets such as education, wealth, beauty and good parentage are undoubtedly nice, but when they decorate persons of a malicious nature, then they act adversely. Another example, given by C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, is that a serpent that has a jewel on its head is still fearful because it is a serpent. A serpent, by nature, is envious of other living entities, even though they be faultless. When a serpent bites another creature, it is not necessarily because the other creature is at fault; it is the habit of the serpent to bite innocent creatures. Similarly, although Dak\u1e63a was qualified by many material assets, because he was proud of his possessions and because he was envious, all those qualities were polluted. It is therefore sometimes detrimental for a person advancing in spiritual consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, to possess such material assets. Kunt\u012bdev\u012b, while offering prayers to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, addressed Him as aki\u00f1cana-gocara, one who is easily approached by those who are bereft of all material acquisitions. Material exhaustion is an advantage for advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, although if one is conscious of his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can utilize one\u2019s material assets, such as great learning and beauty and exalted ancestry, for the service of the Lord; then such assets become glorious. In other words, unless one is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, all his material possessions are zero, but when this zero is by the side of the Supreme One, it at once increases in value to ten. Unless situated by the side of the Supreme One, zero is always zero; one may add one hundred zeros, but the value will still remain zero. Unless one\u2019s material assets are used in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, they may play havoc and degrade the possessor."

        "translation": "One who is conducted by false ego and thus always distressed, both mentally and sensually, cannot tolerate the opulence of self-realized persons. Being unable to rise to the standard of self-realization, he envies such persons as much as demons envy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " The real reason for the enmity between Lord \u015aiva and Dak\u1e63a is explained here. Dak\u1e63a was envious of Lord \u015aiva because of \u015aiva\u2019s high position as an incarnation of a quality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and because \u015aiva was directly in contact with the Supersoul and was therefore honored and given a better sitting place than he. There were many other reasons also. Dak\u1e63a, being materially puffed up, could not tolerate the high position of Lord \u015aiva, so his anger at Lord \u015aiva\u2019s not standing up in his presence was only the final manifestation of his envy. Lord \u015aiva is always in meditation and always perceives the Supersoul, as expressed here by the words p\u016bru\u1e63a-buddhi-s\u0101k\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101m. The position of one whose intelligence is always absorbed in meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very great and cannot be imitated by anyone, especially an ordinary person. When Dak\u1e63a entered the arena of yaj\u00f1a, Lord \u015aiva was in meditation and might not have seen Dak\u1e63a enter, but Dak\u1e63a took the opportunity to curse him because Dak\u1e63a had maintained an envious attitude towards Lord \u015aiva for a long time. Those who are actually self-realized see every individual body as a temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature, is residing in everyone\u2019s body. When one offers respect to the body, it is not to the material body but to the presence of the Supreme Lord. Thus one who is always in meditation upon the Supreme Lord is always offering Him obeisances. But since Dak\u1e63a was not very elevated, he thought that obeisances were offered to the material body, and because Lord \u015aiva did not offer respect to his material body, Dak\u1e63a became envious. Such persons, being unable to rise to the standard of self-realized souls like Lord \u015aiva, are always envious. The example given here is very suitable. Asuras, demons or atheists, are always envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; they simply want to kill Him. Even in this age we find some so-called scholars commenting on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakta\u1e25 (Bg. 18.65) \u2014 \u201cAlways think of Me, become My devotee, and surrender unto Me\u201d \u2014 the so-called scholars comment that it is not to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that we have to surrender. That is envy. The asuras or atheists, the demons, without reason or cause, are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, instead of offering respect to self-realized persons, foolish men who cannot approach the highest standard of self-realization are always envious, although there is no reason."

But those who are elevated to the transcendental platform, being intelligent, offer such respects to the Supersoul, who is sitting within the body, not to the person who identifies with the body.",
        "purport": " It may be argued that since Dak\u1e63a was the father-in-law of Lord \u015aiva, it was certainly the duty of Lord \u015aiva to offer him respect. In answer to that argument it is explained here that when a learned person stands up or offers obeisances in welcome, he offers respect to the Supersoul, who is sitting within everyone\u2019s heart. Among Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, therefore, it is seen that even when a disciple offers obeisances to his spiritual master, the spiritual master immediately returns the obeisances because they are mutually offered not to the body but to the Supersoul. Therefore the spiritual master also offers respect to the Supersoul situated in the body of the disciple. The Lord says in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that offering respect to His devotee is more valuable than offering respect to Him. Devotees do not identify with the body, so offering respect to a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava means offering respect to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. It is stated also that, as a matter of etiquette, as soon as one sees a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava one must immediately offer him respect, indicating the Supersoul sitting within. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sees the body as a temple of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Since Lord \u015aiva had already offered respect to the Supersoul in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, offering respect to Dak\u1e63a, who identified with his body, was already performed. There was no need to offer respect to his body, for that is not directed by any Vedic injunction."

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is always pure consciousness, in which the Supreme Personality of Godhead, known as V\u0101sudeva, is revealed without any covering.",
        "purport": " The living entity is constitutionally pure. Asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25. In the Vedic literature it is said that the soul is always pure and uncontaminated by material attachment. The identification of the body with the soul is due to misunderstanding. As soon as one is fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious it is to be understood that one is in his pure, original constitutional position. This state of existence is called \u015buddha-sattva, which means that it is transcendental to the material qualities. Since this \u015buddha-sattva existence is under the direct action of the internal potency, in this state the activities of material consciousness stop. For example, when iron is put into a fire, it becomes warm, and when red-hot, although it is iron, it acts like fire. Similarly, when copper is surcharged with electricity, its action as copper stops; it acts as electricity. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26) also confirms that anyone who engages in unadulterated devotional service to the Lord is at once elevated to the position of pure Brahman: Therefore \u015buddha-sattva, as described in this verse, is the transcendental position, which is technically called vasudeva. Vasudeva is also the name of the person from whom K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears. This verse explains that the pure state is called vasudeva because in that state V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is revealed without any covering. To execute unadulterated devotional service, therefore, one must follow the rules and regulations of devotional service without desire to gain material profit by fruitive activities or mental speculation. In pure devotional service one simply serves the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a matter of duty, without reason and without being impeded by material conditions. That is called \u015buddha-sattva, or vasudeva, because in that stage the Supreme Person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is revealed in the heart of the devotee. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has very nicely described this vasudeva, or \u015buddha-sattva, in his Bhagavat-sandarbha. He explains that a\u1e63\u1e6dottara-\u015bata (108) is added to the name of the spiritual master to indicate one who is situated in \u015buddha-sattva, or in the transcendental state of vasudeva. The word vasudeva is also used for other purposes. For example, vasudeva also means one who is everywhere, or all-pervading. The sun is also called vasudeva-\u015babditam. The word vasudeva may be utilized for different purposes, but whatever purpose we adopt, V\u0101sudeva means the all-pervading or localized Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19) it is also stated, v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti. Factual realization is to understand V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and surrender unto Him. Vasudeva is the ground wherein V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is revealed. When one is free from the contamination of material nature and is situated in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or in the vasudeva state, V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Person, is revealed. This state is also called kaivalya, which means \u201cpure consciousness.\u201d J\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 s\u0101ttvika\u1e41 kaivalyam: when one is situated in pure, transcendental knowledge, one is situated in kaivalya. Therefore vasudeva also means kaivalya, a word which is generally used by impersonalists. Impersonal kaivalya is not the last stage of realization. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness kaivalya, when one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then one is successful. In that pure state, by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc., because of the development of knowledge of the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All these activities are under the guidance of the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The action of the internal potency is also described in this verse as ap\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25, free from any covering. Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His name, His form, His quality, His paraphernalia, etc., being transcendental, are beyond material nature, it is not possible to understand any one of them with the materialistic senses. When the senses are purified by the discharge of pure devotional service (h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate), the pure senses can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without covering. Now one may inquire that since factually the devotee has the same material existential body, how is it possible that the same materialistic eyes become purified by devotional service? The example, as stated by Lord Caitanya, is that devotional service cleanses the mirror of the mind. In a clean mirror one can see one\u2019s face very distinctly. Similarly, simply by cleansing the mirror of the mind one can have a clear conception of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.8), abhy\u0101sa-yoga-yuktena. By executing one\u2019s prescribed duties in devotional service, cetas\u0101 n\u0101nya-g\u0101min\u0101, or simply by hearing about God and chanting about Him, if one\u2019s mind is always engaged in chanting and hearing and is not allowed to go elsewhere, one can realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed by Lord Caitanya, by the bhakti-yoga process, beginning from hearing and chanting, one can cleanse the heart and mind, and thus one can clearly see the face of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord \u015aiva said that since his heart was always filled with the conception of V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because of the Supreme Lord\u2019s presence within his mind and heart, he was always offering obeisances unto that Supreme Godhead. In other words, Lord \u015aiva is always in trance, sam\u0101dhi. This sam\u0101dhi is not under the control of the devotee; it is under the control of V\u0101sudeva, for the entire internal energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead acts under His order. Of course, the material energy also acts by His order, but His direct will is specifically executed through the spiritual energy. Thus by His spiritual energy He reveals Himself. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.6), sambhav\u0101my \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101. \u0100tma-m\u0101yay\u0101 means \u201cinternal potency.\u201d By His sweet will He reveals Himself by His internal potency, being satisfied by the transcendental loving service of the devotee. The devotee never commands, \u201cMy dear Lord, please come here so that I can see You.\u201d It is not the position of the devotee to command the Supreme Personality of Godhead to come before him or to dance before him. There are many so-called devotees who command the Lord to come before them dancing. The Lord, however, is not subject to anyone\u2019s command, but if He is satisfied by one\u2019s pure devotional activities, He reveals Himself. Therefore a meaningful word in this verse is adhok\u1e63aja, for it indicates that the activities of our material senses will fail to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One cannot realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by the attempt of one\u2019s speculative mind, but if one desires he can subdue all the material activities of his senses, and the Lord, by manifesting His spiritual energy, can reveal Himself to the pure devotee. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead reveals Himself to the pure devotee, the devotee has no other duty than to offer Him respectful obeisances. The Absolute Truth reveals Himself to the devotee in His form. He is not formless. V\u0101sudeva is not formless, for it is stated in this verse that as soon as the Lord reveals Himself, the devotee offers his obeisances. Obeisances are offered to a person, not to anything impersonal. One should not accept the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da interpretation that V\u0101sudeva is impersonal. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, prapadyate: one surrenders. One surrenders to a person, not to impersonal nonduality. Whenever there is a question of surrendering or offering obeisances, there must be an object of surrender or obeisances."
