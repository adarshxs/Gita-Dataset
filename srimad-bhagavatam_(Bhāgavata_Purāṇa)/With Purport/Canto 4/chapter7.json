        "purport": " Bh\u1e5bgu Muni, a great supporter of Dak\u1e63a, was awarded the beard of the goat\u2019s head which was substituted for the head of Dak\u1e63a. It appears from the exchange of Dak\u1e63a\u2019s head that the modern scientific theory that the brain substance is the cause of all intelligent work is not valid. The brain substance of Dak\u1e63a and that of a goat are different, but Dak\u1e63a still acted like himself, even though his head was replaced by that of a goat. The conclusion is that it is the particular consciousness of an individual soul which acts. The brain substance is only an instrument which has nothing to do with real intelligence. The real intelligence, mind and consciousness are part of the particular individual soul. It will be found in the verses ahead that after Dak\u1e63a\u2019s head was replaced by the goat\u2019s head, he was as intelligent as he had previously been. He prayed very nicely to satisfy Lord \u015aiva and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, which is not possible for a goat to do. Therefore it is definitely concluded that the brain substance is not the center of intelligence; it is the consciousness of a particular soul that works intelligently. The whole movement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to purify the consciousness. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of brain one has because if he simply transfers his consciousness from matter to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his life becomes successful. It is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that anyone who takes up K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness achieves the highest perfection of life, regardless of whatever abominable condition of life he may have fallen into. Specifically, anyone in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness goes back to Godhead, back to home, on leaving his present material body."

He is also known as \u0100\u015buto\u1e63a, which indicates that he is very quickly satisfied and very quickly angered. It is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that less intelligent persons go to the demigods for material benedictions. In this connection, people generally go to Lord \u015aiva, and because he is always quickly satisfied and gives benedictions to his devotees without consideration, he is called m\u012b\u1e0dhu\u1e63\u1e6dama, or the best of the benedictors. Materialistic persons are always anxious to get material profit, but they are not serious about spiritual profit. Sometimes, of course, it so happens that Lord \u015aiva becomes the best benedictor in spiritual life. It is said that once a poor br\u0101hma\u1e47a worshiped Lord \u015aiva for a benediction, and Lord \u015aiva advised the devotee to go to see San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b. The devotee went to San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b and informed him that Lord \u015aiva had advised him to seek out the best benediction from him (San\u0101tana). San\u0101tana had a touchstone with him, which he kept with the garbage. On the request of the poor br\u0101hma\u1e47a, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b gave him the touchstone, and the br\u0101hma\u1e47a was very happy to have it. He now could get as much gold as he desired simply by touching the touchstone to iron. But after he left San\u0101tana, he thought, \u201cIf a touchstone is the best benediction, why has San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b kept it with the garbage?\u201d He therefore returned and asked San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u201cSir, if this is the best benediction, why did you keep it with the garbage?\u201d San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b then informed him, \u201cActually, this is not the best benediction. But are you prepared to take the best benediction from me?\u201d The br\u0101hma\u1e47a said, \u201cYes, sir. Lord \u015aiva has sent me to you for the best benediction.\u201d Then San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b asked him to throw the touchstone in the water nearby and then come back. The poor br\u0101hma\u1e47a did so, and when he returned, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b initiated him with the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. Thus by the benediction of Lord \u015aiva the br\u0101hma\u1e47a got the association of the best devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and was thus initiated in the mah\u0101-mantra: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."

        "purport": " The example given here is that Dak\u1e63a got up as if he were awakened from deep sleep. In Sanskrit this is called supta ivottasthau. The meaning is that after a man awakens from sleep, he immediately remembers all the duties which he must execute. Dak\u1e63a was killed, and his head was taken away and burned to ashes. His body was lying dead, but by the grace of Lord \u015aiva, as soon as the head of a goat was joined to the body, Dak\u1e63a came back to consciousness again. This indicates that consciousness is also individual. Dak\u1e63a actually took another body when he took on the head of a goat, but because consciousness is individual, his consciousness remained the same although his bodily condition changed. Thus bodily construction has nothing to do with the development of consciousness. Consciousness is carried with the transmigration of the soul. There are many instances of this in Vedic history, such as the case of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata. After quitting his body as a king, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata was transferred to the body of a deer, but he retained the same consciousness. He knew that although formerly he was King Bharata, he had been transferred to the body of a deer because of his absorption in thinking of a deer at the time of his death. In spite of his having the body of a deer, however, his consciousness was as good as it was in the body of King Bharata. The arrangement by the Lord is so nice that if a person\u2019s consciousness is turned into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no doubt that in his next life he will be a great devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even if he is offered a different type of body."

        "translation": "King Dak\u1e63a said: My dear Lord \u015aiva, I committed a great offense against you, but you are so kind that instead of withdrawing your mercy, you have done me a great favor by punishing me. You and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u never neglect even useless, unqualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Why, then, should you neglect me, who am engaged in performing sacrifices?",
        "purport": " Although Dak\u1e63a felt defeated, he knew that his punishment was simply the great mercy of Lord \u015aiva. He remembered that Lord \u015aiva and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are never neglectful of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, even though the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are sometimes unqualified. According to Vedic civilization, a descendant of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family should never be heavily punished. This was exemplified in Arjuna\u2019s treatment of A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101. A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 was the son of a great br\u0101hma\u1e47a, Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, and in spite of his having committed the great offense of killing all the sleeping sons of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, for which he was condemned even by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna excused him by not killing him because he happened to be the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The word brahma-bandhu\u1e63u used here is significant. Brahma-bandhu means a person who is born of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a father but whose activities are not up to the standard of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Such a person is not a br\u0101hma\u1e47a but a brahma-bandhu. Dak\u1e63a proved himself to be a brahma-bandhu. He was born of a great br\u0101hma\u1e47a father, Lord Brahm\u0101, but his treatment of Lord \u015aiva was not exactly brahminical; therefore he admitted that he was not a perfect br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Lord \u015aiva and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, however, are affectionate even to an imperfect br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Lord \u015aiva punished Dak\u1e63a not as one does his enemy; rather, he punished Dak\u1e63a just to bring him to his senses, so that he would know that he had done wrong. Dak\u1e63a could understand this, and he acknowledged the great mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord \u015aiva towards the fallen br\u0101hma\u1e47as, including even himself. Although he was fallen, his vow was to execute the sacrifice, as is the duty of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and thus he began his prayers to Lord \u015aiva."

        "translation": "My dear great and powerful Lord \u015aiva, you were created first from the mouth of Lord Brahm\u0101 in order to protect the br\u0101hma\u1e47as in pursuing education, austerities, vows and self-realization. As protector of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, you always protect the regulative principles they follow, just as a cowherd boy keeps a stick in his hand to give protection to the cows.",
        "purport": " The specific function of a human being in society, irrespective of his social status, is to practice control of the mind and senses by observing the regulative principles enjoined in the Vedic \u015b\u0101stras. Lord \u015aiva is called pa\u015bupati because he protects the living entities in their developed consciousness so that they may follow the Vedic system of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama. The word pa\u015bu refers to the animal as well as to the human entity. It is stated here that Lord \u015aiva is always interested in protecting the animals and the animalistic living entities, who are not very advanced in the spiritual sense. It is also stated that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are produced from the mouth of the Supreme Lord. We should always remember that Lord \u015aiva is being addressed as the representative of the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the Vedic literature it is described that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are born from the mouth of the universal form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the k\u1e63atriyas are born from His arms, the vai\u015byas from His abdomen or waist, and the \u015b\u016bdras from His legs. In the formation of a body, the head is the principal factor. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as are born from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order to accept charity for worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and to spread Vedic knowledge. Lord \u015aiva is known as pa\u015bupati, the protector of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and other living entities. He protects them from the attacks of non-br\u0101hma\u1e47as, or uncultured persons who are against the self-realization process. Another feature of this word is that persons who are simply attached to the ritualistic portion of the Vedas and do not understand the situation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are not any more advanced than animals. In the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is confirmed that even though one performs the rituals of the Vedas, if he does not develop a sense of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then all his labor in performing Vedic rituals is considered to be simply a waste of time. Lord \u015aiva\u2019s aim in destroying the Dak\u1e63a yaj\u00f1a was to punish Dak\u1e63a because by neglecting him (Lord \u015aiva), Dak\u1e63a was committing a great offense. Lord \u015aiva\u2019s punishment was just like that of a cowherd boy, who keeps a stick to frighten his animals. It is commonly said that to give protection to animals, a stick is needed because animals cannot reason and argue. Their reasoning and argument is argumentum ad baculum; unless there is a rod, they do not obey. Force is required for the animalistic class of men, whereas those who are advanced are convinced by reasons, arguments and scriptural authority. Persons who are simply attached to Vedic rituals, without further advancement of devotional service, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, are almost like animals, and Lord \u015aiva is in charge of giving them protection and sometimes punishing them, as he punished Dak\u1e63a."

        "purport": " As usual, a devotee in an adverse condition of life accepts such a condition to be the mercy of the Lord. Factually, the insulting words used by Dak\u1e63a against Lord \u015aiva were enough to have him thrown perpetually into a hellish life. But Lord \u015aiva, being kind toward him, awarded him punishment to neutralize the offense. King Dak\u1e63a realized this and, feeling obliged for Lord \u015aiva\u2019s magnanimous behavior, wanted to show his gratitude. Sometimes a father punishes his child, and when the child is grown up and comes to his senses, he understands that the father\u2019s punishment was not actually punishment but mercy. Similarly, Dak\u1e63a appreciated that the punishment offered to him by Lord \u015aiva was a manifestation of Lord \u015aiva\u2019s mercy. That is the symptom of a person making progress on the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is said that a devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness never takes any miserable condition of life to be condemnation by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He accepts the miserable condition to be the grace of the Lord. He thinks, \u201cI would have been punished or put into a more dangerous condition of life due to my past misdeeds, but the Lord has protected me. Thus I have received only a little punishment as token execution of the law of karma.\u201d Thinking of His grace in that way, a devotee always surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead more and more seriously and is not disturbed by such so-called punishment."

Then they arranged to offer into the fire the oblations known as puro\u1e0d\u0101\u015ba.",
        "purport": " Lord \u015aiva\u2019s followers and devotees, headed by V\u012brabhadra, are known as v\u012bras, and they are ghostly demons. Not only did they pollute the entire sacrificial arena by their very presence, but they disturbed the whole situation by passing stool and urine. Therefore, the infection they had created was to be first purified by the method of offering puro\u1e0d\u0101\u015ba oblations. A vi\u1e63\u1e47u-yaj\u00f1a, or an offering to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, cannot be performed uncleanly. To offer anything in an unclean state is called a sev\u0101par\u0101dha. The worship of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Deity in the temple is also vi\u1e63\u1e47u-yaj\u00f1a. In all Vi\u1e63\u1e47u temples, therefore, the priest who takes care of the arcan\u0101-vidhi must be very clean. Everything should be always kept neat and clean, and the foodstuffs should be prepared in a neat and clean manner. All these regulative principles are described in The Nectar of Devotion. There are thirty-two kinds of offenses in discharging arcan\u0101 service. It is required, therefore, that one be extremely careful not to be unclean. Generally, whenever any ritualistic ceremony is begun, the holy name of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is first chanted in order to purify the situation. Whether one is in a pure or impure condition, internally or externally, if one chants or even remembers the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, one immediately becomes purified. The yaj\u00f1a arena was desecrated by the presence of Lord \u015aiva\u2019s followers, headed by V\u012brabhadra, and therefore the entire arena had to be sanctified. Although Lord \u015aiva was present and he is all-auspicious, it was still necessary to sanctify the place because his followers had broken into the arena and committed so many obnoxious acts. That sanctification was possible only by chanting the holy name of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Trikap\u0101la, which can sanctify the three worlds. In other words, it is admitted herein that the followers of Lord \u015aiva are generally unclean. They are not even very hygienic; they do not take baths regularly, they wear long hair, and they smoke g\u0101\u00f1j\u0101. Persons of such irregular habits are counted amongst the ghosts. Since they were present in the sacrificial arena, the atmosphere became polluted, and it had to be sanctified by trikap\u0101la oblations, which indicated the invocation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s favor."

The Lord appears, just as the morning sun rises, to protect the whole universal creation. His arms display different weapons, and His eight hands are compared to the eight petals of a lotus flower.

These four symbols are seen in the four hands of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in different arrangements. The club and the wheel are the Lord\u2019s symbols of punishment for the demons and miscreants, and the lotus flower and conchshell are used to bless the devotees. There are always two classes of men, the devotees and the demons. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101m), the Lord is always ready for the protection of the devotees and annihilation of the demons. There are demons and devotees in this material world, but in the spiritual world there is no such distinction. In other words, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the proprietor of both the material and spiritual worlds. In the material world almost everyone is of the demoniac nature, but there are also devotees, who appear to be in the material world although they are always situated in the spiritual world.

        "purport": " The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is always unlimited, and His glories cannot be completely enumerated by anyone, even by a personality like Lord Brahm\u0101. It is said that Ananta, a direct incarnation of the Lord, has unlimited mouths, and with each mouth He has been trying to describe the glories of the Lord for an unlimited span of time, yet the glories of the Lord remain unlimited, and He therefore never finishes. It is not possible for any ordinary living entity to understand or to glorify the unlimited Personality of Godhead, but one can offer prayers or service to the Lord according to one\u2019s particular capacity. This capacity is increased by the service spirit. Sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau means that the service of the Lord begins with the tongue. This refers to chanting. By chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one begins the service of the Lord. Another function of the tongue is to taste and accept the Lord\u2019s pras\u0101da. We have to begin our service to the Unlimited with the tongue and become perfect in chanting, and accepting the Lord\u2019s pras\u0101da. To accept the Lord\u2019s pras\u0101da means to control the entire set of senses. The tongue is considered to be the most uncontrollable sense because it hankers for so many unwholesome eatables, thereby forcing the living entity into the dungeon of material conditional life. As the living entity transmigrates from one form of life to another, he has to eat so many abominable foodstuffs that finally there is no limit. The tongue should be engaged in chanting and in eating the Lord\u2019s pras\u0101da so that the other senses will be controlled. Chanting is the medicine, and pras\u0101da is the diet. With these processes one can begin his service, and as the service increases, the Lord reveals more and more to the devotee. But there is no limit to His glories, and there is no limit to engaging oneself in the service of the Lord."

        "translation": "Lord \u015aiva said: My dear Lord, my mind and consciousness are always fixed on Your lotus feet, which, as the source of all benediction and the fulfillment of all desires, are worshiped by all liberated great sages because Your lotus feet are worthy of worship. With my mind fixed on Your lotus feet, I am no longer disturbed by persons who blaspheme me, claiming that my activities are not purified. I do not mind their accusations, and I excuse them out of compassion, just as You exhibit compassion toward all living entities.",
        "purport": " Lord \u015aiva expresses herein his regret at having been angry and having disturbed the sacrificial activities of Dak\u1e63a. King Dak\u1e63a had insulted him in many ways, and thus he had become angry and had frustrated the entire sacrificial ceremony. Later, when he was pleased, the yaj\u00f1a performances were reinstituted, and therefore he regretted his activities. Now he says that because his mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he is no longer disturbed by the ordinary critics of his way of life. From this statement by Lord \u015aiva it is understood that as long as one is on the material platform one is affected by the three modes of material nature. As soon as one is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, one is no longer affected by such material activities. One should therefore always be fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, busy in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. It is guaranteed that such a devotee will never be affected by the actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature. This fact is also corroborated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: anyone who is fixed in the transcendental service of the Lord has surpassed all the material qualities and is situated in the status of Brahman realization, in which one is not afflicted by hankering for material objects. The recommendation of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is that one should always be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and should never forget his transcendental relationship with the Lord. This program has to be followed strictly by everyone. From the statement of Lord \u015aiva it is understood that he was always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thus he remained free from material affliction. The only remedy, therefore, is to continue K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness rigidly, in order to get out of the contamination of the material modes."

Everyone believes in the concept of the body, and all are thus submerged in the darkness of illusion.

By mentioning Brahm\u0101, the chief of all living entities within this material world, he wanted to state that everyone, including also Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, is under the concept of the body and under the spell of material energy \u2014 all but Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. That is the version of Bh\u1e5bgu. As long as one is under the concept of the body as self, it is very difficult to understand the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Conscious that he was not greater than Brahm\u0101, Bh\u1e5bgu included himself in the list of offenders. Ignorant personalities, or conditioned souls, have no choice but to accept their precarious condition under material nature. The only remedy is to surrender to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and always pray to be excused. One should depend only on the causeless mercy of the Lord for deliverance and not even slightly on one\u2019s own strength. That is the perfect position of a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. The Lord is everyone\u2019s friend, but He is especially friendly to the surrendered soul. The simple process, therefore, is that a conditioned soul should remain surrendered to the Lord, and the Lord will give him all protection to keep him out of the clutches of material contamination."

        "translation": "Lord Brahm\u0101 said: My dear Lord, Your personality and eternal form cannot be understood by any person who is trying to know You through the different processes of acquiring knowledge. Your position is always transcendental to the material creation, whereas the empiric attempt to understand You is material, as are its objectives and instruments.",
        "purport": " It is said that the transcendental name, qualities, activities, paraphernalia, etc., of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be understood with our material senses. The attempt of the empiric philosophers to understand the Absolute Truth by speculation is always futile because their process of understanding, their objective and the instruments by which they try to understand the Absolute Truth are all material. The Lord is apr\u0101k\u1e5bta, beyond the creation of the material world. This fact is also accepted by the great impersonalist \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya: n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 paro\u00a0\u2019vyakt\u0101d a\u1e47\u1e0dam avyakta-sambhavam. Avyakta, or the original material cause, is beyond this material manifestation and is the cause of the material world. Because N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is beyond the material world, one cannot speculate upon Him by any material method. One has to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by the transcendental method of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55). Bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti: only by devotional service can one understand the transcendental form of the Lord. The difference between the impersonalists and the personalists is that the impersonalists, limited by their speculative processes, cannot even approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the devotees please the Supreme Personality of Godhead through His transcendental loving service. Sevonmukhe hi: due to the service attitude of the devotee, the Lord is revealed to him. The Supreme Lord cannot be understood by materialistic persons even though He is present before them. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore condemns such materialists as m\u016b\u1e0dhas. M\u016b\u1e0dha means \u201crascal.\u201d It is said in the G\u012bt\u0101, \u201cOnly rascals think of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary person. They do not know what Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s position is or what His transcendental potencies are.\u201d Unaware of His transcendental potencies, the impersonalists deride the person of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas the devotees, by dint of their service attitude, can understand Him as the Personality of Godhead. In the Tenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Arjuna also confirmed that it is very difficult to understand the personality of the Lord."

In such a form, Your Lordship is always prepared to punish the demons, who are envious of Your devotees.",
        "purport": " It is generally understood from revealed scriptures that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u appears with four hands, but in this particular sacrificial arena Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u arrived with eight hands. King Indra said, \u201cEven though we are accustomed to see Your four-handed Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form, this appearance with eight hands is as real as the four-handed form.\u201d As Lord Brahm\u0101 had said, to realize the transcendental form of the Lord is beyond the power of the senses. In reply to that statement by Brahm\u0101, King Indra said that even though the transcendental form of the Lord is not perceivable by the material senses, His activities and His transcendental form can be understood. The Lord\u2019s uncommon features, uncommon activities and uncommon beauty can be perceived even by an ordinary man. For example, when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared just like a six- or seven-year-old boy in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, He was approached by the residents there. There were torrents of rain, and the Lord saved the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana by lifting Govardhana Hill and resting it on the little finger of His left hand for seven days. This uncommon feature of the Lord should convince even materialistic persons who want to speculate to the limit of their material senses. The activities of the Lord are pleasing to experimental vision also, but impersonalists will not believe in His identity because they study the personality of the Lord by comparing their personality to His. Because men in this material world cannot lift a hill, they do not believe that the Lord can lift one. They accept the statements of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam to be allegorical, and they try to interpret them in their own way. But factually the Lord lifted the hill in the presence of all the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, as corroborated by great \u0101c\u0101ryas and authors like Vy\u0101sadeva and N\u0101rada. Everything about the Lord \u2014 His activities, pastimes and uncommon features \u2014 should be accepted as is, and in this way, even in our present condition, we can understand the Lord. In the instance herein, King Indra confirmed: \u201cYour presence with eight hands is as good as Your presence with four hands.\u201d There is no doubt about it."

        "purport": " Animals were offered in sacrifice in order to give them renewed life; that was the purpose of having animals there. Offering an animal in sacrifice and giving him renewed life was the evidence of the strength of chanting mantras. Unfortunately, when Dak\u1e63a\u2019s sacrifice was devastated by Lord \u015aiva, some of the animals were killed. (One was killed just to replace the head of Dak\u1e63a.) Their bodies were lying about, and the sacrificial arena was turned into a crematorium. Thus the real purpose of yaj\u00f1a was lost. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, being the ultimate objective of such sacrificial ceremonies, was requested by the wives of the priests to glance over the yaj\u00f1a arena with His causeless mercy so that the routine work of the yaj\u00f1a might be continued. The purport here is that animals should not be unnecessarily killed. They were used to prove the strength of the mantras and were to have been rejuvenated by the use of the mantras. They should not have been killed, as they were by Lord \u015aiva to replace the head of Dak\u1e63a with an animal\u2019s head. It was pleasing to see an animal sacrificed and rejuvenated, and that pleasing atmosphere had been lost. The wives of the priests requested that the animals be brought back to life by the glance of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to make a pleasing yaj\u00f1a."

        "purport": " This statement is from the Siddhas, the inhabitants of Siddhaloka, where the eight kinds of material perfection are complete. The residents of Siddhaloka have full control in the eight kinds of yogic perfection, but from their statement it appears that they are pure devotees. They always merge in the nectarean river of hearing of the pastimes of the Lord. Hearing of the pastimes of the Lord is called k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101. Similarly, there is a statement by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that those who are always merged in the ocean of the nectar of describing the Lord\u2019s pastimes are liberated and have no fear of the material condition of life. The Siddhas say that the mind of an ordinary person is full of anxieties. The example is given of the elephant who has suffered in a forest fire and who enters into a river for relief. If persons who are suffering in the forest fire of this material existence will only enter into the nectarean river of the description of the pastimes of the Lord, they will forget all the troubles of the miserable material existence. The Siddhas do not care for fruitive activities, such as performing sacrifices and achieving the good results. They simply merge in the transcendental discussions of the pastimes of the Lord. That makes them completely happy, without care for pious or impious activities. For those who are always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness there is no need to perform any kind of pious or impious sacrifices or activities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is itself complete, for it includes all the processes praised in the Vedic scriptures."

Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, without an understanding of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, any advancement in a civilization, no matter how sophisticated, is of no value. There is a statement in the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya (3.11): The purport is that sometimes when a friend or relative dies, especially among lower-class men, the dead body is decorated. Dressed and ornamented, the body is taken in procession. That sort of decoration of the dead body has no actual value because the life force is already gone. Similarly, without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, any aristocracy, any social prestige or any advancement of material civilization is as good as the decoration of a dead body. The name of the wife of Dak\u1e63a was Pras\u016bti, and she was the daughter of Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu. Her sister, Devah\u016bti, was married to Kardama Muni, and Kapiladeva, the Personality of Godhead, became her son. Pras\u016bti, then, was the aunt of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. She was asking the favor of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in an affectionate mode; since she was His aunt, she sought some special favor. Also significant in this verse is that the Lord is praised with the goddess of fortune. Wherever Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped, naturally there is the favor of the goddess of fortune. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is addressed as am\u1e5bta, transcendental. The demigods, including Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, were produced after the creation, but Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u existed before the creation. He is therefore addressed as am\u1e5bta. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped with His internal energy by the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Pras\u016bti, the wife of Dak\u1e63a, implored the Lord to turn the priests into Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas instead of simply fruitive workers performing sacrifices for some material benefits."

This monism is based on pure knowledge as described and confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.17): priyo hi j\u00f1\u0101nino\u00a0\u2019tyartham aha\u1e41 sa ca mama priya\u1e25. The Lord says that those who are advanced in transcendental knowledge and know the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are very dear to Him, and He also is very dear to them. Those who are actually in perfect knowledge of the science of God know that the living entities are superior energy of the Supreme Lord. This is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Seventh Chapter: the material energy is inferior, and the living entities are superior energy. Energy and the energetic are nondifferent; therefore, energies possess the same quality as the energetic. Persons who are in full knowledge of the Personality of Godhead, analyzing His different energies and knowing their own constitutional position, are certainly very, very dear to the Lord. Persons, however, who may not even be conversant with knowledge of the Supreme Personality but who always think of the Lord with love and faith, feeling that He is great and that they are His parts and parcels, ever His servitors, are even more favored by Him. The particular significance of this verse is that the Lord is addressed as vatsala. Vatsala means \u201calways favorably disposed.\u201d The Lord\u2019s name is bhakta-vatsala. The Lord is famous as bhakta-vatsala, which means that He is always favorably inclined to the devotees, whereas He is never addressed anywhere in the Vedic literature as j\u00f1\u0101ni-vatsala."

He Himself is not under the control of the external energy: in His personal feature He is completely devoid of the variegated manifestation of material qualities, and He is under no illusion of false identification.",
        "purport": " Two situations are described in this verse: one is the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world, and the other is the Lord\u2019s own establishment. There is also quality in the Lord\u2019s own establishment, the kingdom of God. It is stated here that Goloka is His personal situation. There is also quality in Goloka, but that quality is not divided into creation, maintenance and annihilation. In the external energy, the interaction of the three qualities makes it possible for things to be created, maintained and annihilated. But in the spiritual world, or the kingdom of God, there is no such exhibition, since everything is eternal, sentient and blissful. There is a class of philosophers who misunderstand the appearance of the Personality of Godhead within this material world. They are under the impression that when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears He is under the spell of the three qualities, like all the other living entities who appear within this material world. That is their misunderstanding; as it is clearly stated here (sva-sa\u1e41sthay\u0101), by His internal potency He is transcendental to all these material qualities. Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, \u201cI appear by My internal potency.\u201d Both the internal and external potencies are under the control of the Supreme, so He does not come under the control of either of these potencies. Rather, everything is under His control. In order to manifest His transcendental name, form, quality, pastimes and paraphernalia, He brings into action His internal energy. On account of the variegatedness of the external potency, there are manifestations of many qualitative demigods, beginning with Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, and people are attracted to these demigods according to their own material quality. But when one is transcendental or surpasses the material qualities, he is simply fixed in the worship of the Supreme Personality. This fact is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: anyone engaged in the service of the Lord is already transcendental to the variegatedness and interaction of the three material qualities. The summary is that the conditioned souls are being pulled by the action and reaction of the material qualities, which create a differentiation of energies, but in the spiritual world the worshipable one is the Supreme Lord and no one else."

        "purport": " In the material world there is the trinity of the three material qualities. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has accepted the superintendence of the quality of goodness, which is the source of religion, knowledge, austerity, renunciation, opulence, etc. Because of this, actual peace, prosperity, knowledge and religion can be attained when the living entities are under the control of the quality of goodness in the material world. As soon as they are subjected to the control of the other two qualities, namely passion and ignorance, their precarious conditional life becomes intolerable. But Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, in His original position, is always nirgu\u1e47a, which means transcendental to these material qualities. Gu\u1e47a means \u201cquality,\u201d and nir means \u201cnegation.\u201d This does not indicate, however, that He has no qualities; He has transcendental qualities by which He appears and manifests His pastimes. The positive transcendental qualitative manifestation is unknown to the students of the Vedas as well as to the great stalwart demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva. Actually, the transcendental qualities are manifested only to the devotees. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, simply by discharging devotional service one can understand the transcendental position of the Supreme Lord. Those who are in the mode of goodness can partially enter into the transcendental understanding, but it is advised in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that one has to surpass this. The Vedic principles are based on the three qualities of the material modes. One has to transcend the three qualities, and then one can be situated in pure and simple spiritual life."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly said that yaj\u00f1a should be performed for Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has one thousand popular transcendental names, out of which one name is Yaj\u00f1a. It is clearly said that everything should be done for the satisfaction of Yaj\u00f1a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; all other actions a person may take are only causes for his bondage. Everyone has to perform yaj\u00f1a according to the Vedic hymns. As stated in the Upani\u1e63ads, fire, the altar, the auspicious full moon, the period of four months called c\u0101turm\u0101sya, the sacrificial animal, and the beverage called soma are necessary requisites, as are the specific hymns mentioned in the Vedas and composed of four letters. One hymn is as follows: \u0101\u015br\u0101vayeti catur-ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 astu \u015brau\u1e63a\u1e0d iti catur-ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 yajeti dv\u0101bhy\u0101\u1e41 ye yaj\u0101maha\u1e25. These mantras, chanted according to the \u015bruti and sm\u1e5bti literatures, are only to please Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. For the deliverance of those who are materially conditioned and attached to material enjoyment, performing yaj\u00f1a and following the rules and regulations of the four divisions of society and of spiritual life are recommended. It is said in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a that by offering sacrifice to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u one can gradually be liberated. The whole target of life, therefore, is to please Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. That is yaj\u00f1a. Any person who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has dedicated his life for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the origin of all Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms, and by offering worship and pras\u0101da daily, he becomes the best performer of yaj\u00f1a. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is clearly stated that in this Age of Kali the only successful performance of yaj\u00f1a, or sacrifice, is yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yai\u1e25: the best type of sacrifice is simply to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. This yaj\u00f1a is offered before the form of Lord Caitanya, as other yaj\u00f1as are offered before the form of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. These recommendations are found in the Eleventh Canto of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Moreover, this yaj\u00f1a performance confirms that Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Himself. As Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u appeared at the Dak\u1e63a yaj\u00f1a long, long ago, Lord Caitanya has appeared in this age to accept our sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a."

Please give us protection.",
        "purport": " The devastation indicated in this verse is the partial devastation of the lower planets within the universe when Lord Brahm\u0101 goes to sleep. The higher planetary systems, beginning with Maharloka, Janaloka and Tapoloka, are not inundated at the time of this devastation. The Lord is the creator, as indicated in this verse, because the energies of creation are manifested through His body, and after annihilation, He conserves all the energy within His abdomen. Another significant point in this verse is that the demigods said, \u201cWe are all Your servants (bh\u1e5bty\u0101n). Give us Your protection.\u201d The demigods depend on the protection of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; they are not independent. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, therefore, condemns the worship of demigods because there is no need of it and clearly states that only those who have lost their sense go asking favors of the demigods. Generally, if anyone has material desires to be fulfilled, he can ask Vi\u1e63\u1e47u instead of going to the demigods. Those who worship demigods are not very intelligent. Besides that, the demigods say, \u201cWe are Your eternal servants.\u201d So those who are servants, or devotees of the Lord, are not very much concerned with fruitive activities, the performance of prescribed yaj\u00f1as, or mental speculation. They simply serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead sincerely, with love and faith, performing everything with that loving service, and the Lord gives such devotees direct protection. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cSimply surrender unto Me, and I will give you protection from all the reactions of sinful activities.\u201d This material world is so created that one has to act sinfully, knowingly or unknowingly, and unless his life is dedicated to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he has to suffer all the reactions of sinful activities. But one who surrenders and dedicates his life for the service of the Lord has direct protection from the Lord. He has no fear of suffering from sinful activities, nor does he desire, willingly or unwillingly, to do anything which is sinful."

Actually Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Supreme Lord, but there is even one above Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is also the plenary portion of a part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this verse this is referred to by the word a\u1e41\u015b\u0101\u1e41\u015b\u0101\u1e25, which refers to part and parcel of a part and parcel. There are similar verses in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta which indicate that the Supreme Lord\u2019s parts and parcels again expand into other parts and parcels. As described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, there are many manifestations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and many manifestations of living entities. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u manifestations are called sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba, partial manifestations, and the living entities are called vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba. The demigods like Brahm\u0101 and Indra have been promoted to such exalted positions by pious activities and austerities, but actually Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the master of everyone. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said, ekale \u012b\u015bvara k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u0101ra saba bh\u1e5btya. This means that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a alone is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all others, even the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva and certainly the living entities, are His servitors. Baladeva is the immediate expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He also engages in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and certainly the ordinary living entities are serving. Everyone is created, constitutionally, for serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Here the Gandharvas acknowledge that although the demigods may represent themselves as the Supreme, actually they are not supreme. Real supremacy belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam is the statement of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only Supreme Lord.\u201d Worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a alone, therefore, includes worship of all the parts and parcels, just as watering the root of a tree also waters all the branches, twigs, leaves and flowers."

        "translation": "The Vidy\u0101dharas said: Dear Lord, this human form of body is meant for attaining the highest perfectional objective, but, impelled by Your external energy, the living entity misidentifies himself with his body and with the material energy, and therefore, influenced by m\u0101y\u0101, he wants to become happy by material enjoyment. He is misled and always attracted by temporary, illusory happiness. But Your transcendental activities are so powerful that if one engages in hearing and chanting such topics, he can be delivered from illusion.",
        "purport": " The human form of life is called arthada because the body can very nicely help the embodied soul to achieve the highest perfection. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said that even though temporary, the body can give us the highest perfectional achievement. In the process of evolution from the lower to the higher grade of living, the human form of life is a great boon. But m\u0101y\u0101 is so strong that in spite of achieving this great boon of the human form of life, we are influenced by temporary material happiness, and we forget our goal of life. We are attracted by things which will cease to exist. The beginning of such attraction is the temporary body. In this horrible condition of life there is only one way of liberation \u2014 to engage in the activities of transcendental chanting and hearing of the holy name of the Supreme Lord: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The words yu\u1e63mat-kath\u0101m\u1e5bta-ni\u1e63evaka\u1e25 mean \u201cthose who engage in relishing the nectar of the topics of Your Lordship.\u201d There are two narrative books which especially concern the words and activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the instruction given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the book containing topics exclusively about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotees. These two books are the special nectar of the words of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. For those who engage in the preaching of these two Vedic literatures it is very easy to get out of the illusory conditional life imposed upon us by m\u0101y\u0101. The illusion is that the conditioned soul does not try to understand his spiritual identity. He is more interested in his external body, which is only a flash and which will be finished as soon as the time is designated. The whole atmosphere will change when the living entity has to transmigrate from one body to another. Under the spell of m\u0101y\u0101, he will again be satisfied in a different atmosphere. This spell of m\u0101y\u0101 is called \u0101vara\u1e47\u0101tmik\u0101 \u015bakti because it is so strong that the living entity is satisfied in any abominable condition. Even if he is born as a worm living within the intestine or abdomen in the midst of urine and stool, still he is satisfied. This is the covering influence of m\u0101y\u0101. But the human form of life is a chance to understand, and if one misses this opportunity, he is most unfortunate. The way to get out of illusory m\u0101y\u0101 is to engage in the topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord Caitanya advocated a process whereby everyone may remain in his present position without change but simply hear from the proper authoritative sources about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord Caitanya advised everyone to spread the word of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He advised, \u201cAll of you become spiritual masters. Your duty is simply to talk to whomever you meet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or of the instructions given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is operating for this purpose. We do not ask anyone to first change his position and then come to us. Instead, we invite everyone to come with us and simply chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, because we know that if one simply chants and hears the topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one\u2019s life will change; he will see a new light, and his life will be successful."

You are the priests who perform the yaj\u00f1a, You are the demigods headed by Indra, and You are the sacrificial animal. Everything that is sacrificed is You or Your energy.",
        "purport": " In this statement Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s all-pervasiveness is partially explained. It is said in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a that as a fire situated in one place emanates its heat and illumination everywhere, so whatever we see within the material or spiritual worlds is nothing but a manifestation of different energies emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 statement is that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is everything \u2014 the fire, the offering, the clarified butter, the utensils, the place of sacrifice and the ku\u015ba. He is everything. It is confirmed herein that the performance of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a in this age is as good as all other yaj\u00f1as in all other ages. If one performs sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, there is no need to arrange elaborate paraphernalia for the prescribed sacrificial ceremonies recommended in the Vedas. In the chant of the holy names, Hare and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare means the energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva. Combined together they are everything. In this age, persons are harassed by the influence of Kali-yuga and cannot arrange for all the requisite paraphernalia for performing sacrifice as recommended in the Vedas. But if one simply chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is to be understood that he is performing all kinds of yaj\u00f1a because there is nothing within our vision except Hare (the energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His energies. Thus, since everything is a manifestation of His energy, it is to be understood that everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One simply has to accept everything in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and he is a liberated person. One should not misunderstand that because everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no personal identity. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so full that in spite of keeping Himself separate from everything by His energy, He is everything. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Ninth Chapter. He is spread throughout the creation as everything, but still He is not everything. The philosophy recommended by Lord Caitanya is that He is simultaneously one and different."

Anyone who engages in the worship of the Deity, or the form of the Lord in the temple, is understood to be studying all the Vedas twenty-four hours a day. Simply by decorating the Deities of the Lord, R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the temple, one very minutely studies the injunctions of the Vedas. Even a neophyte devotee who simply engages in the worship of the Deity is understood to be in direct touch with the purport of Vedic knowledge. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: the purport of the Vedas is to understand Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

He therefore addressed Dak\u1e63a in a pleasing attitude.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29) it is said, bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101m: Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the supreme enjoyer of all the results of sacrifices, austerities and penances; in whatever one may engage, the ultimate goal is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. If a person does not know that, he is misled. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has nothing to demand from anyone. He is self-satisfied, self-sufficient, but He accepts the offerings of yaj\u00f1a because of His friendly attitude toward all living entities. When His share of the sacrificial results was offered to Him, He appeared very pleased. It is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26), patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toya\u1e41 yo me bhakty\u0101 prayacchati: if any devotee offers Him even a small leaf, or a flower or water, if it is offered with love and affection, the Lord accepts it and is pleased. Although He is self-sufficient and does not need anything from anyone, He accepts such offerings because, as Supersoul, He has such a friendly attitude toward all living entities. Another point here is that He does not encroach upon another\u2019s share. In the yaj\u00f1a there is a share for the demigods, Lord \u015aiva, and Lord Brahm\u0101, and a share for Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. He is satisfied with His own share and does not encroach upon others\u2019. Indirectly, He indicated that He was not satisfied with Dak\u1e63a\u2019s trying to deny Lord \u015aiva his share. Maitreya addressed Vidura as sinless because Vidura was a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and never committed any offense to any demigod. Although Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas accept Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as the Supreme, they are not prone to offend demigods. They give the demigods proper respect. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas accept Lord \u015aiva as the best Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. For a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava there is no possibility of offending any demigods, and the demigods are also pleased with the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava because they are faultless devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u."

Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is therefore the supreme cause. In the Vedas also it is stated that in the beginning there was only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; there was no Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva. Similarly, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya confirmed this: n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 para\u1e25. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is the origin, and Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are manifested after creation. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is also \u0101tme\u015bvara, the Supersoul in everyone. Under His direction, everything is prompted from within. For example, in the beginning of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated, tene brahma h\u1e5bd\u0101: He first educated Lord Brahm\u0101 from within. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.2) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states, aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m: Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the origin of all demigods, including Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. In another place in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states, aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25: \u201cEverything is generated from Me.\u201d This includes all the demigods. Similarly, in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra: janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25. And in the Upani\u1e63ads is the statement yato v\u0101 im\u0101ni bh\u016bt\u0101ni j\u0101yante. Everything is generated from Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, everything is maintained by Him, and everything is annihilated by His energy. Therefore, by their actions and reactions, the energies which come from Him create the cosmic manifestations and also dissolve the whole creation. Thus the Lord is the cause and also the effect. Whatever effect we see is the interaction of His energy, and because the energy is generated from Him, He is both cause and effect. Simultaneously, everything is different and the same. It is said that everything is Brahman: sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma. In the highest vision, nothing is beyond Brahman, and therefore Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva are certainly nondifferent from Him."

The superior energy is the living entity, who is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. As parts and parcels, the living entities are not different from the Supreme Lord; the energy emanated from Him is not different from Him. But in the actual activity of this material world, the living entity is under the different qualities of material energy and in different forms. There are 8,400,000 life forms. The same living entity acts under the influence of the different qualities of material nature. The entities have different bodies, but originally, in the beginning of creation, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is alone. For the purpose of creation, Brahm\u0101 is manifested, and for annihilation there is Lord \u015aiva. As far as the spiritual entrance into the material world is concerned, all beings are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but under the covering of different material qualities they have different names. Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva are qualitative incarnations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, as gu\u1e47a-avat\u0101ras, and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u with them accepts control of the quality of goodness; therefore He is also a qualitative incarnation like Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. Actually the different names exist for different directions; otherwise the origin is one only."
