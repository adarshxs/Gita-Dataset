This envy is also found in the personality of the King of heaven, Indra. As evident from revealed scriptures, Indra was several times envious of many persons. He was especially envious of great fruitive activities and the execution of yoga practices, or siddhis. Indeed, he could not tolerate them, and he desired to break them up. He was envious due to fear that those who performed great sacrifices for the execution of mystic yoga might occupy his seat. Since no one in this material world can tolerate another\u2019s advancement, everyone in the material world is called matsara, envious. In the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is therefore said that \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is meant for those who are completely nirmatsara (nonenvious). In other words, one who is not free from the contamination of envy cannot advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, if someone excels another person, the devotee who is excelled thinks how fortunate the other person is to be advancing in devotional service. Such nonenvy is typical of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. However, when one is envious of his competitor, that is material. The demigods posted in the material world are not exempt from envy."

Actually P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a living entity, but he acquired specific powers from Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, however, is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus belongs to the category of vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu belonged to the j\u012bva-tattva. The vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva indicates God, whereas the j\u012bva-tattva indicates the part and parcel of God. When God\u2019s part and parcel is especially empowered, he is called \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba-avat\u0101ra. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is herein described as harir \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25. The Lord is so kind that He takes all miserable conditions away from His devotees. Consequently He is called Hari. He is described as \u012b\u015bvara because He can do whatever He likes. He is the supreme controller. The supreme \u012b\u015bvara puru\u1e63ottama is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He exhibits His powers as \u012b\u015bvara, or the supreme controller, when He assures His devotee in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\u201d He can immediately make His devotee immune from all the reactions caused by sinful life if the devotee simply surrenders unto Him. He is described herein as sarv\u0101tm\u0101, meaning that He is present in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul, and as such He is the supreme teacher of everyone. If we are fortunate enough to take the lessons given by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, our lives immediately become successful. No one can give better instructions to human society than Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "purport": " In this verse the word dharma-dugh\u0101 is significant, for it indicates k\u0101ma-dhenu. K\u0101ma-dhenu is also known as surabhi. Surabhi cows inhabit the spiritual world, and, as stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is engaged in tending these cows: surabh\u012br abhip\u0101layantam. One can milk a surabhi cow as often as one likes, and the cow will deliver as much milk as one requires. Milk, of course, is necessary for the production of so many milk products, especially clarified butter, which is required for the performance of great sacrifices. Unless we are prepared to perform the prescribed sacrifices, our supply of the necessities of life will be checked. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms that Lord Brahm\u0101 created human society along with yaj\u00f1a, the performance of sacrifice. Yaj\u00f1a means Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and sacrifice means working for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, however, it is very difficult to find qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as who can perform sacrifices as prescribed in the Vedas. Therefore it is recommended in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yai\u1e25) that by performing sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a and by satisfying the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, Lord Caitanya, one can derive all the results derived by great sacrifices in the past. King P\u1e5bthu and others derived all the necessities of life from the earthly planet by performing great sacrifices. Now this sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement has already been started by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. People should take advantage of this great sacrifice and join in the Society\u2019s activities; then there will be no scarcity. If sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a is performed, there will be no difficulty, not even in industrial enterprises. Therefore this system should be introduced in all spheres of life \u2014 social, political, industrial, commercial, etc. Then everything will run very peacefully and smoothly."

        "translation": "The flowing rivers supplied all kinds of tastes \u2014 sweet, pungent, sour, etc. \u2014 and very big trees supplied fruit and honey in abundance. The cows, having eaten sufficient green grass, supplied profuse quantities of milk, curd, clarified butter and similar other necessities.",
        "purport": " If rivers are not polluted and are allowed to flow in their own way, or sometimes allowed to flood the land, the land will become very fertile and able to produce all kinds of vegetables, trees and plants. The word rasa means \u201ctaste.\u201d Actually all rasas are tastes within the earth, and as soon as seeds are sown in the ground, various trees sprout up to satisfy our different tastes. For instance, sugarcane provides its juices to satisfy our taste for sweetness, and oranges provide their juices to satisfy our taste for a mixture of the sour and the sweet. Similarly, there are pineapples and other fruits. At the same time, there are chilies to satisfy our taste for pungency. Although the earth\u2019s ground is the same, different tastes arise due to different kinds of seeds. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.10), b\u012bja\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m: \u201cI am the original seed of all existences.\u201d Therefore all arrangements are there. And as stated in \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad, p\u016br\u1e47am idam: complete arrangements for the production of all the necessities of life are made by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. People should therefore learn how to satisfy the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Indeed, the living entity\u2019s prime business is to satisfy the Lord because the living entity is part and parcel of the Lord. Thus the whole system is so arranged that the living entity must do his duty as he is constitutionally made. Without doing so, all living entities must suffer. That is the law of nature. The words taravo bh\u016bri-var\u1e63m\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 indicate very luxuriantly grown, big-bodied trees. The purpose of these trees was to produce honey and varieties of fruit. In other words, the forest also has its purpose in supplying honey, fruits and flowers. Unfortunately in Kali-yuga, due to an absence of yaj\u00f1a, there are many big trees in the forests, but they do not supply sufficient fruits and honey. Thus everything is dependent on the performance of yaj\u00f1a. The best way to perform yaj\u00f1a in this age is to spread the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement all over the world."

The oceans and seas produce pearls, coral and valuable jewels so that fortunate law-abiding people can utilize them. Similarly, the hills are full of chemicals so that when rivers flow down from them the chemicals spread over the fields to fertilize the four kinds of foodstuffs. These are technically known as carvya (those edibles which are chewed), lehya (those which are licked up), c\u016b\u1e63ya (those which are swallowed) and peya (those which are drunk). P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was greeted by the residents of other planets and their presiding deities. They presented various gifts to the King and acknowledged him as the proper type of king by whose planning and activities everyone throughout the universe could be happy and prosperous. It is clearly indicated in this verse that the oceans and seas are meant for producing jewels, but in Kali-yuga the oceans are mainly being utilized for fishing. \u015a\u016bdras and poor men were allowed to fish, but the higher classes like the k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas would gather pearls, jewels and coral. Although poor men would catch tons of fish, they would not be equal in value to one piece of coral or pearl. In this age so many factories for the manufacture of fertilizers have been opened, but when the Personality of Godhead is pleased by the performance of yaj\u00f1as, the hills automatically produce fertilizing chemicals, which help produce edibles in the fields.

Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu is an incarnation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, yet he is a great devotee of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Although an empowered incarnation of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he is nonetheless a living entity. As such, he must be a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although one is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is an incarnation, he should not forget his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Kali-yuga there are many self-made incarnations, rascals, who declare themselves to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words bhagav\u0101n indra\u1e25 indicate that a living entity can even be as exalted and powerful as King Indra, for even King Indra is an ordinary living entity in the material world and possesses the four defects of the conditioned soul. King Indra is described herein as bhagav\u0101n, which is generally used in reference to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this case, however, King Indra is addressed as bhagav\u0101n because he has so much power in his hands. Despite his becoming bhagav\u0101n, he is envious of the incarnation of God, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. The defects of material life are so strong that due to contamination King Indra becomes envious of an incarnation of God. We should try to understand, therefore, how a conditioned soul becomes fallen. The opulence of King P\u1e5bthu was not dependent on material conditions. As described in this verse, he was a great devotee of Adhok\u1e63aja. The word adhok\u1e63aja indicates the Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the expression of mind and words. However, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears before the devotee in His original form of eternal bliss and knowledge. The devotee is allowed to see the Supreme Lord face to face, although the Lord is beyond the expression of our senses and beyond our direct perception."

It is understood that even King Indra is not liberated from the clutches of material contamination. Thus the words \u0101muktam iva, meaning \u201cas if he were liberated,\u201d are used. The saffron dress worn by a sanny\u0101s\u012b announces to the world that he has renounced all worldly affairs and is simply engaged in the service of the Lord. Such a devotee is actually a sanny\u0101s\u012b, or liberated person. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.1) it is said: \u201cOne who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no work.\u201d In other words, one who offers the results of his activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually a sanny\u0101s\u012b and yog\u012b. Cheating sanny\u0101s\u012bs and yog\u012bs have existed since the time of P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s sacrifice. This cheating was very foolishly introduced by King Indra. In some ages such cheating is very prominent, and in other ages not so prominent. It is the duty of a sanny\u0101s\u012b to be very cautious because, as stated by Lord Caitanya, sanny\u0101s\u012bra alpa chidra sarva-loke g\u0101ya: \u201cA little spot in a sanny\u0101s\u012b\u2019s character will be magnified by the public.\u201d (Cc. Madhya 12.51) Therefore, unless one is very sincere and serious, he should not take up the order of sanny\u0101sa. One should not use this order as a means to cheat the public. It is better not to take up sanny\u0101sa in this Age of Kali because provocations are very strong in this age. Only a very exalted person advanced in spiritual understanding should attempt to take up sanny\u0101sa. One should not adopt this order as a means of livelihood or for some material purpose."

A trida\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012b is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012b, and an ekada\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012b is a M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012b. There are many other types of sanny\u0101s\u012bs, who are not approved by Vedic rituals. A type of pseudo-sanny\u0101sa was introduced by Indra when he tried to hide himself from the attack of Vijit\u0101\u015bva, the great son of King P\u1e5bthu. Now there are many different types of sanny\u0101s\u012bs. Some of them go naked, and some of them carry a skull and trident, generally known as k\u0101p\u0101lika. All of them were introduced under some meaningless circumstances, and those who have a poor fund of knowledge accept these false sanny\u0101s\u012bs and their pretenses, although they are not bona fide guides to spiritual advancement. At the present moment some missionary institutions, without referring to the Vedic rituals, have introduced some sanny\u0101s\u012bs who engage in sinful activities. The sinful activities forbidden by the \u015b\u0101stras are illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. These so-called sanny\u0101s\u012bs indulge in all these activities. They eat meat and flesh, fish, eggs and just about everything. They sometimes drink with the excuse that without alcohol, fish and meat, it is impossible to remain in the cold countries near the Arctic zone. These sanny\u0101s\u012bs introduce all these sinful activities in the name of serving the poor, and consequently poor animals are cut to pieces and go into the bellies of these sanny\u0101s\u012bs. As described in the following verses, such sanny\u0101s\u012bs are p\u0101kha\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bs. Vedic literature states that a person who puts Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a on the level with Lord \u015aiva or Lord Brahm\u0101 immediately becomes a p\u0101kha\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b. As stated in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as: In Kali-yuga the p\u0101kha\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bs are very prominent. However, Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has tried to kill all these p\u0101kha\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bs by introducing His sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement. Those who take advantage of this sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness will be able to save themselves from the influence of these p\u0101kha\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bs."

Practically none of the sanny\u0101s\u012bs in this age are bona fide. No one can introduce any new system into the Vedic way of life; if one does so out of malice, he is to be known as a p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b, or atheist.

The Vedic \u015b\u0101stras practically prohibit the adoption of sanny\u0101sa in the Age of Kali because less intelligent men may accept the sanny\u0101sa order for cheating purposes. Actually the only religion is the religion of surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We must serve the Lord in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. All other systems of sanny\u0101sa and religion are actually not bona fide. In this age they are simply passing for religious systems. This is most regrettable."

        "purport": " Lord Brahm\u0101 came down to pacify King P\u1e5bthu regarding his continual performance of one hundred sacrifices. King P\u1e5bthu was determined to perform one hundred sacrifices, and King Indra took this very seriously because Indra himself was known as the performer of one hundred sacrifices. Just as it is the nature of all living entities within this material world to become envious of their competitors, King Indra, although King of heaven, was also envious of King P\u1e5bthu and therefore wanted to stop him from performing one hundred sacrifices. Actually there was great competition, and King Indra, to satisfy his senses, began to invent so many irreligious systems to obstruct King P\u1e5bthu. To stop these irreligious inventions, Lord Brahm\u0101 personally appeared in the sacrificial arena. As far as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was concerned, he was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore it was not necessary for him to perform the prescribed Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Such ceremonies are known as karma, and there is no need for a devotee in the transcendental position to execute them. As the ideal king, however, it was King P\u1e5bthu\u2019s duty to perform sacrifices. A compromise was therefore to be worked out. By the blessings of Lord Brahm\u0101, King P\u1e5bthu would become more famous than King Indra. Thus P\u1e5bthu\u2019s determination to perform one hundred sacrifices was indirectly fulfilled by the blessings of Lord Brahm\u0101."

        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.21): \u201cWhatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.\u201d For his own sense gratification, King Indra thought to defeat Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu in the performance of one hundred horse sacrifices. Consequently he stole the horse and hid himself amid so many irreligious personalities, taking on the false guise of a sanny\u0101s\u012b. Such activities are attractive to the people in general; therefore they are dangerous. Lord Brahm\u0101 thought that instead of allowing Indra to further introduce such irreligious systems, it would be better to stop the sacrifice. A similar stance was taken by Lord Buddha when people were overly engrossed in the animal sacrifices recommended by Vedic instructions. Lord Buddha had to introduce the religion of nonviolence by contradicting the Vedic sacrificial instructions. Actually, in the sacrifices the slaughtered animals were given a new life, but people without such powers were taking advantage of such Vedic rituals and unnecessarily killing poor animals. Therefore Lord Buddha had to deny the authority of the Vedas for the time being. One should not perform sacrifices that will induce reversed orders. It is better to stop such sacrifices. As we have repeatedly explained, due to a lack of qualified brahminical priests in Kali-yuga, it is not possible to perform the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the Vedas. Consequently the \u015b\u0101stras instruct us to perform the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. By the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana sacrifice, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His form of Lord Caitanya, will be satisfied and worshiped. The entire purpose of performing sacrifices is to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is present in His form of Lord Caitanya; therefore people who are intelligent should try to satisfy Him by performing sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. This is the easiest way to satisfy Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in this age. People should take advantage of the injunctions in different \u015b\u0101stras concerning sacrifices in this age and not create unnecessary disturbances during the sinful Age of Kali. In Kali-yuga men all over the world are very expert in opening slaughterhouses for killing animals, which they eat. If the old ritualistic ceremonies were observed, people would be encouraged to kill more and more animals. In Calcutta there are many butcher shops which keep a deity of the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, and animal-eaters think it proper to purchase animal flesh from such shops in hope that they are eating the remnants of food offered to the goddess K\u0101l\u012b. They do not know that the goddess K\u0101l\u012b never accepts nonvegetarian food because she is the chaste wife of Lord \u015aiva. Lord \u015aiva is also a great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and never eats nonvegetarian food, and the goddess K\u0101l\u012b accepts the remnants of food left by Lord \u015aiva. Therefore there is no possibility of her eating flesh or fish. Such offerings are accepted by the associates of the goddess K\u0101l\u012b known as bh\u016btas, pi\u015b\u0101cas and R\u0101k\u1e63asas, and those who take the pras\u0101da of the goddess K\u0101l\u012b in the shape of flesh or fish are not actually taking the pras\u0101da left by the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, but the food left by the bh\u016btas and pi\u015b\u0101cas."

        "translation": "O King P\u1e5bthu, son of Vena, you are the part-and-parcel expansion of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Due to the mischievous activities of King Vena, religious principles were almost lost. At that opportune moment you descended as the incarnation of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Indeed, for the protection of religious principles you have appeared from the body of King Vena.",
        "purport": " The way in which Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u kills the demons and protects the faithful is mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.8): \u201cIn order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium.\u201d In two hands Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u always carries a club and a cakra to kill demons, and in His other two hands He holds a conchshell and a lotus to give protection to His devotees. When His incarnation is present on this planet or in this universe, the Lord kills the demons and protects His devotees simultaneously. Sometimes Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u appears in His person as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Lord R\u0101ma. All of these appearances are mentioned in the \u015b\u0101stras. Sometimes He appears as a \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba-avat\u0101ra like Lord Buddha. As explained before, these \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba-avat\u0101ras are incarnations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s power invested in a living entity. Living entities are also part and parcel of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but they are not as powerful; therefore when a living entity descends as an incarnation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he is especially empowered by the Lord. When King P\u1e5bthu is described as an incarnation of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it should be understood that he is a \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba-avat\u0101ra, part and parcel of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and is specifically empowered by Him. Any living being acting as the incarnation of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is thus empowered by Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to preach the bhakti cult. Such a person can act like Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and defeat demons by arguments and preach the bhakti cult exactly according to the principles of \u015b\u0101stra. As indicated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, whenever we find someone extraordinary preaching the bhakti cult, we should know that he is especially empowered by Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As confirmed in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Antya 7.11), k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-\u015bakti vin\u0101 nahe t\u0101ra pravartana: one cannot explain the glories of the holy name of the Lord without being specifically empowered by Him. If one criticizes or finds fault with such an empowered personality, one is to be considered an offender against Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and is punishable. Even though such offenders may dress as Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas with false tilaka and m\u0101l\u0101, they are never forgiven by the Lord if they offend a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. There are many instances of this in the \u015b\u0101stras."

In other words, it is the duty of the state or king to put a stop to pseudoreligious systems produced by unscrupulous persons. Originally a religious principle is one, given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and it comes through the channel of disciplic succession in two forms. Lord Brahm\u0101 requested P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to desist from his unnecessary competition with Indra, who was determined to stop P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja from completing one hundred yaj\u00f1as.
