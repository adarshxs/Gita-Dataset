        "purport": " The system of brahmacarya has been current since the birth of Brahm\u0101. A section of the population, especially male, did not marry at all. Instead of allowing their semen to be driven downwards, they used to lift the semen up to the brain. They are called \u016brdhva-retasa\u1e25, those who lift up. Semen is so important that if, by the yogic process, one can lift the semen up to the brain, he can perform wonderful work \u2014 one\u2019s memory is enabled to act very swiftly, and the duration of life is increased. Yog\u012bs can thus perform all kinds of austerity with steadiness and be elevated to the highest perfectional stage, even to the spiritual world. Vivid examples of brahmac\u0101r\u012bs who accepted this principle of life are the four sages Sanaka, Sanandana, San\u0101tana and Sanat-kum\u0101ra, as well as N\u0101rada and others. Another significant phrase here is naite g\u1e5bh\u0101n hy \u0101vasan, \u201cthey did not live at home.\u201d G\u1e5bha means \u201chome\u201d as well as \u201cwife.\u201d In fact, \u201chome\u201d means wife; \u201chome\u201d does not mean a room or a house. One who lives with a wife lives at home; otherwise, a sanny\u0101s\u012b or brahmac\u0101r\u012b, even though he may live in a room or in a house, does not live at home. That they did not live at home means that they did not accept a wife, and so there was no question of their discharging semen. Semen is meant to be discharged when one has a home, a wife and the intention to beget children; otherwise there is no injunction for discharging semen. These principles were followed from the beginning of creation, and such brahmac\u0101r\u012bs never created progeny. This narration has dealt with the descendants of Lord Brahm\u0101 from Manu\u2019s daughter Pras\u016bti. Pras\u016bti\u2019s daughter was D\u0101k\u1e63\u0101ya\u1e47\u012b, or Sat\u012b, in relation to whom the story of the Dak\u1e63a yaj\u00f1a was narrated. Maitreya is now explaining about the progeny of the sons of Brahm\u0101. Out of the many sons of Brahm\u0101, the brahmac\u0101r\u012b sons headed by Sanaka and N\u0101rada did not marry at all, and therefore there is no question of narrating the history of their descendants."

This is the beginning of sex life between brother and sister. This unnatural combination of sex life can be possible in human society only where there is Adharma, or Irreligion. It is understood that in the beginning of creation Brahm\u0101 created not only saintly sons like Sanaka, San\u0101tana and N\u0101rada but also demoniac offspring like Nir\u1e5bti, Adharma, Dambha and Falsity. Everything was created by Brahm\u0101 in the beginning. Regarding N\u0101rada, it is understood that because his previous life was very pious and his association very good, he was born as N\u0101rada. Others were also born in their own capacities, according to their backgrounds. The law of karma continues birth after birth, and when there is a new creation, the same karma comes back with the living entities. They are born in different capacities according to karma even though their father is originally Brahm\u0101, who is the exalted qualitative incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Although Brahm\u0101 is j\u012bva-tattva, he is empowered by the Lord, and therefore he is considered a plenary expansion of the Supreme Godhead. Sometimes it happens that when there is no suitable living being to be empowered to act as Brahm\u0101, the Supreme Lord Himself appears as Brahm\u0101. Brahm\u0101 is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu was the direct son of Brahm\u0101. The great sage Maitreya is now going to explain about the descendants of this Manu, all of whom are widely celebrated for their pious activities. Before speaking of these pious descendants, Maitreya has already described the descendants of impious activities, representing anger, envy, unpalatable speech, quarrel, fear and death. Purposely, therefore, he is next relating the history of the life of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the most pious king within this universe."

By hearing the activities of pious Dhruva, one can enhance one\u2019s faith in God and can directly connect with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus one can very soon be elevated to the transcendental platform of devotional service. The example of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s austerities can immediately generate a feeling of devotional service in the hearts of the hearers."

        "purport": " The system of bhakti-yoga described by Queen Sun\u012bti to her son is the standard way of God realization. Everyone can continue in his constitutional occupational duties and at the same time keep the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart. This was also instructed by the Lord Himself to Arjuna in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cGo on fighting, but keep Me within your mind.\u201d That should be the motto of every honest person seeking perfection in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In this connection, Queen Sun\u012bti advised her son that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as bh\u1e5btya-vatsala, which indicates that He is very kind to His devotees. She said, \u201cYou came to me crying, having been insulted by your stepmother, but I am unable to do any good for you. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind to His devotees that if you go to Him, then the combined kindness of millions of mothers like me will be surpassed by His affectionate and tender dealings. When everyone else fails to mitigate one\u2019s misery, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is able to help the devotee.\u201d Queen Sun\u012bti also stressed that the process of approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not easy, but is sought after by great sages who are very advanced in spiritual realization. Queen Sun\u012bti also indicated by her instruction that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was only a small child, five years old, and it was not possible for him to purify himself by the way of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. But by the process of bhakti-yoga, even a child less than five years old, or anyone of any age, can be purified. That is the special significance of bhakti-yoga. Therefore she advised him not to accept worship of the demigods or any other process but simply to take to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the result would be all perfection. As soon as one places the Supreme Personality of Godhead within one\u2019s heart, everything becomes easy and successful."

        "purport": " Sun\u012bti pointed out herewith that the benediction received from the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that received from the demigods are not on an equal level. Foolish persons say that no matter whom one worships one will get the same result, but actually that is not a fact. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is also said that benedictions received from the demigods are all temporary and are meant for the less intelligent. In other words, because the demigods are all materialistically conditioned souls, although they are situated in very exalted positions, their benedictions cannot be permanent. Permanent benediction is spiritual benediction, since a spirit soul is eternal. It is also said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that only persons who have lost their intelligence go to worship the demigods. Therefore Sun\u012bti told her son that he should not seek the mercy of the demigods, but should directly approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead to mitigate his misery. Material opulences are controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead through His different potencies and specifically the goddess of fortune. Therefore, those who are after material opulences seek the pleasure or mercy of the goddess of fortune. Even the highly placed demigods worship the goddess of fortune, but the goddess of fortune, Mah\u0101-Lak\u1e63m\u012b herself, is always seeking the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone, therefore, who takes to the worship of the Supreme Lord automatically receives the blessings of the goddess of fortune. At this stage of his life, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was seeking material opulences, and his mother advised rightly that even for material opulences it is better to worship not the demigods but the Supreme Lord. Although a pure devotee does not seek benedictions from the Supreme Lord for material advancement, it is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that pious persons go to the Lord even for material benedictions. A person who goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for material gain is gradually purified in association with the Supreme Lord. Thus he becomes free from all material desires and is elevated to the platform of spiritual life. Unless one is raised to the spiritual platform, it is not possible for him to completely transcend all material contamination. Sun\u012bti, the mother of Dhruva, was a farseeing woman, and therefore she advised her son to worship the Supreme Lord and no one else. The Lord is described herein as lotus eyed (padma-pal\u0101\u015ba-locan\u0101t). When a person is fatigued, if he sees a lotus flower all his fatigue can be immediately reduced to nil. Similarly, when an aggrieved person sees the lotus face of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, immediately all his grief is reduced. A lotus flower is also an insignia in the hand of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as well as in the hand of the goddess of fortune. The worshipers of the goddess of fortune and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u together are certainly very opulent in all respects, even in material life. The Lord is sometimes described as \u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam, which means that Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 also offer their respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a."

He then becomes a householder and executes household duties according to the Vedic process. Then the householder becomes a v\u0101naprastha, and gradually, when he is mature, he renounces household life and v\u0101naprastha life also and takes to sanny\u0101sa, completely devoting himself to devotional service. Generally, people think that childhood is meant for enjoying life by engaging oneself in sports and play, youth is meant for enjoying the company of young girls, and when one becomes old, at the time of death, then he may try to execute devotional service or a mystic yoga process. But this conclusion is not for devotees who are actually serious. The great sage N\u0101rada is instructing Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja just to test him. Actually, the direct order is that from any point of life one should begin rendering devotional service. But it is the duty of the spiritual master to test the disciple to see how seriously he desires to execute devotional service. Then he may be initiated."

But as far as I am concerned, I am covered by ignorance, and this kind of philosophy does not touch my heart.",
        "purport": " There are various classes of men. One class is called ak\u0101m\u012bs, referring to those who have no material desire. Desire must exist, either material or spiritual. Material desire arises when one wants to satisfy one\u2019s personal senses. One who is ready to sacrifice anything to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be said to have spiritual desire. Dhruva did not accept the instruction given by the great saint N\u0101rada because he thought himself unfit for such instruction, which prohibited all material desires. It is not a fact, however, that those who have material desires are prohibited from worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the essential instruction from the life of Dhruva. He frankly admitted that his heart was full of material desires. He was very much affected by the cruel words of his stepmother, whereas those who are spiritually advanced do not care about anyone\u2019s condemnation or adoration. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that persons who are actually advanced in spiritual life do not care for the dual behavior of this material world. But Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja frankly admitted that he was not beyond the affliction of material distress and happiness. He was confident that the instruction given by N\u0101rada was valuable, yet he could not accept it. The question raised here is whether or not a person afflicted by material desires is fit to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The answer is that everyone is fit to worship Him. Even if one has many material desires to fulfill, he should take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and worship the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is so merciful that He fulfills everyone\u2019s desires. Through this narration it will become very clear that no one is barred from worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even if one has many material desires."

My stepmother, Suruci, has pierced my heart with her harsh words. Therefore your valuable instruction does not stand in my heart.",
        "purport": " It is said that the heart or mind is just like an earthen pot: once broken, it cannot be repaired by any means. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja gave this example to N\u0101rada Muni. He said that his heart, having been pierced by the arrows of his stepmother\u2019s harsh words, felt so broken that nothing seemed valuable but his desire to counteract her insult. His stepmother had said that because he was born from the womb of Sun\u012bti, a neglected queen of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Utt\u0101nap\u0101da, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was not fit to sit either on the throne or on his father\u2019s lap. In other words, according to his stepmother, he could not be declared king. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s determination, therefore, was to become king of a planet exalted even beyond that possessed by Lord Brahm\u0101, the greatest of all the demigods. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja indirectly informed the great sage N\u0101rada that there are four kinds of human spirit \u2014 the brahminical spirit, the k\u1e63atriya spirit, the vai\u015bya spirit and the \u015b\u016bdra spirit. The spirit of one caste is not applicable to the members of another. The philosophical spirit enunciated by N\u0101rada Muni might have been suitable for a br\u0101hma\u1e47a spirit, but it was not suitable for a k\u1e63atriya. Dhruva frankly admitted that he was lacking in brahminical humility and was therefore unable to accept the philosophy of N\u0101rada Muni. The statements of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja indicate that unless a child is trained according to his tendency there is no possibility of his developing his particular spirit. It was the duty of the spiritual master or teacher to observe the psychological movement of a particular boy and thus train him in a particular occupational duty. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, having already been trained in the k\u1e63atriya spirit, would not accept the brahminical philosophy. In America we have practical experience of this incompatibility of the brahminical and k\u1e63atriya temperaments. The American boys, who have simply been trained as \u015b\u016bdras, are not at all fit to fight in battle. Therefore, when they are called to join the military, they refuse because they do not have k\u1e63atriya spirit. This is a cause of great dissatisfaction in society. That the boys do not have the k\u1e63atriya spirit does not mean that they are trained in brahminical qualities; they are trained as \u015b\u016bdras, and thus in frustration they are becoming hippies. However, as soon as they enter the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement being started in America, they are trained to meet the brahminical qualifications, even though they have fallen to the lowest conditions as \u015b\u016bdras. In other words, since the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is open for everyone, people in general can attain the brahminical qualifications. This is the greatest need at the present moment, for now there are actually no br\u0101hma\u1e47as or k\u1e63atriyas but only some vai\u015byas and, for the most part, \u015b\u016bdras. The classification of society into br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras is very scientific. In the human social body, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are considered the head, the k\u1e63atriyas are the arms, the vai\u015byas are the belly, and the \u015b\u016bdras are the legs. At the present moment the body has legs and a belly, but there are no arms or head, and therefore society is topsy-turvy. It is necessary to reestablish the brahminical qualifications in order to raise the fallen human society to the highest standard of spiritual consciousness."

        "purport": " When Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja refused to accept the brahminical instruction of N\u0101rada Muni, naturally the next question would be what sort of instruction he wanted. So even before N\u0101rada Muni asked, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja expressed his heartfelt desire. His father, of course, was the emperor of the entire world, and his grandfather, Lord Brahm\u0101, was the creator of the universe. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja expressed his desire to possess a kingdom better than those of his father and grandfather. He frankly stated that he wanted a kingdom which had no competitor within the three worlds, namely the higher, middle and lower planetary systems. The greatest personality within this universe is Lord Brahm\u0101, and Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted a position even greater than his. He wanted to take advantage of N\u0101rada Muni\u2019s presence because he knew very well that if N\u0101rada Muni, the greatest devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, could bless him or show him the path, then certainly he would be able to occupy a more exalted position than any person within the three worlds. Thus he wanted help from N\u0101radaj\u012b to achieve that position. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted a position greater than that of Brahm\u0101. This was practically an impossible proposition, but by pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead a devotee can achieve even the impossible. One particular point mentioned here is that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted to occupy an exalted position not by hook or by crook, but by honest means. This indicates that if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a offered him such a position, then he would accept it. That is the nature of a devotee. He may desire material gain, but he accepts it only if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a offers it. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was sorry to refuse the instruction of N\u0101rada Muni; therefore he requested him to be merciful to him by showing a path by which he could fulfill his mind\u2019s desires."

You should therefore completely absorb yourself in the devotional service of the Lord.",
        "purport": " Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s demand was to achieve an abode even greater than Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s. Within this universe, Lord Brahm\u0101 is supposed to be in the most exalted position, for he is the chief of all demigods, but Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted a realm beyond his. Therefore his desire was not to be fulfilled by worshiping any demigod. As described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the benedictions offered by the demigods are all temporary. Therefore N\u0101rada Muni asked Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to follow the path recommended by his mother \u2014 to worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a offers anything, it is beyond the expectation of the devotee. Both Sun\u012bti and N\u0101rada Muni knew that the demand of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was impossible for any demigod to fulfill, and therefore both of them recommended following the process of devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. N\u0101rada Muni is referred to here as bhagav\u0101n because he can bless any person just as the Supreme Personality of Godhead can. He was very pleased with Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and he could have at once personally given whatever he wanted, but that is not the duty of the spiritual master. His duty is to engage the disciple in proper devotional service as prescribed in the \u015b\u0101stras. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was similarly present before Arjuna, and even though He could have given him all facilities for victory over the opposing party without a fight, He did not do so; instead He asked Arjuna to fight. In the same way, N\u0101rada Muni asked Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to undergo devotional discipline in order to achieve the desired result."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that only with the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can the demigods offer benedictions. Therefore, whenever any sacrifice is offered to a demigod, the Supreme Lord in the form of n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-\u015bil\u0101, or \u015b\u0101lagr\u0101ma-\u015bil\u0101, is put forward to observe the sacrifice. Actually, the demigods cannot give any benediction without the sanction of the Supreme Lord. N\u0101rada Muni, therefore, advised that even for religiosity, economic development, sense gratification or liberation, one should approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, offer prayers and ask for the fulfillment of one\u2019s desire at the lotus feet of the Lord. That is real intelligence. An intelligent person never goes to demigods to pray for anything. He goes directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the cause of all benediction. As Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, performance of ritualistic ceremonies is not actually religion. The real path of religion is to surrender at the lotus feet of the Lord. For one who is actually surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord, there is no question of any separate endeavor for economic development. A devotee engaged in service to the Lord is not disappointed in the satisfaction of his senses. If he wants to satisfy his senses, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fulfills that desire. As far as liberation is concerned, any devotee fully engaged in the service of the Lord is already liberated; therefore there is no separate necessity for his liberation. N\u0101rada Muni therefore advised Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to take shelter of V\u0101sudeva, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and engage himself in the way that his mother had advised, for that would help him fulfill his desire. In this verse N\u0101rada Muni has especially stressed the devotional service of the Lord as the only way. In other words, even if one is full of material desires, he can continue his devotional service to the Lord, and all his desires will be fulfilled."

Just by going there, one draws nearer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who always lives there.",
        "purport": " Both N\u0101rada Muni and Sun\u012bti, the mother of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, advised Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now, N\u0101rada Muni is especially giving him directions how this worship of the Supreme Person can very quickly fructify. He recommends that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja go to the bank of the Yamun\u0101, where there is a forest of the name Madhuvana, and begin his meditation and worship there. Places of pilgrimage yield a special advantage for a devotee in quickly advancing his spiritual life. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a lives everywhere, but still it is very easy to approach Him in holy places of pilgrimage because these places are inhabited by great sages. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He lives wherever His devotees are chanting the glories of His transcendental activities. There are many places of pilgrimage in India, and especially prominent are Badar\u012b-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Dv\u0101rak\u0101, R\u0101me\u015bvara and Jagann\u0101tha Pur\u012b. These sacred places are called the four dh\u0101mas. Dh\u0101ma refers to a place where one can immediately contact the Supreme Lord. To go to Badar\u012b-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a one has to pass through Hardwar on the path to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, there are other holy places of pilgrimage, such as Pray\u0101ga (Allahabad) and Mathur\u0101, and the topmost of them all is V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Unless one is very advanced in spiritual life, it is recommended that he live in such holy places and execute devotional service there. But an advanced devotee like N\u0101rada Muni who is engaged in preaching work can serve the Supreme Lord anywhere. Sometimes he even goes to the hellish planets. Hellish conditions do not affect N\u0101rada Muni because he is engaged in greatly responsible activities in devotional service. According to the statement of N\u0101rada Muni, Madhuvana, which is still existing in the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana area, in the district of Mathur\u0101, is a most sacred place. Many saintly persons still live there and engage in the devotional service of the Lord. There are twelve forests in the area of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and Madhuvana is one of them. Pilgrims from all parts of India assemble together and visit all twelve of these forests. There are five forests on the eastern bank of the Yamun\u0101: Bhadravana, Bilvavana, Lauhavana, Bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bravana and Mah\u0101vana. On the western side of the bank there are seven: Madhuvana, T\u0101lavana, Kumudavana, Bahul\u0101vana, K\u0101myavana, Khadiravana and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In those twelve forests there are different gh\u0101\u1e6das, or bathing places. They are listed as follows: (1) Avimukta, (2) Adhir\u016b\u1e0dha, (3) Guhya-t\u012brtha, (4) Pray\u0101ga-t\u012brtha, (5) Kanakhala, (6) Tinduka-t\u012brtha, (7) S\u016brya-t\u012brtha, (8) Va\u1e6dasv\u0101m\u012b, (9) Dhruva-gh\u0101\u1e6da (Dhruva-gh\u0101\u1e6da, where there are many nice trees of fruits and flowers, is famous because Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja meditated and underwent severe penances and austerities there in an elevated spot), (10) \u1e5a\u1e63i-t\u012brtha, (11) Mok\u1e63a-t\u012brtha, (12) Budha-t\u012brtha, (13) Gokar\u1e47a, (14) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aga\u1e45g\u0101, (15) Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, (16) Asi-ku\u1e47\u1e0da, (17) Catu\u1e25-s\u0101mudrika-k\u016bpa, (18) Akr\u016bra-t\u012brtha (when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma were going to Mathur\u0101 in the chariot driven by Akr\u016bra, all of them took bath in this gh\u0101\u1e6da), (19) Y\u0101j\u00f1ika-vipra-sth\u0101na, (20) Kubj\u0101-k\u016bpa, (21) Ra\u1e45ga-sth\u0101la, (22) Ma\u00f1cha-sthala, (23) Mallayuddha-sth\u0101na, and (24) Da\u015b\u0101\u015bvamedha."

After bathing, you should perform the necessary regulative principles for a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga and then sit down on your \u0101sana [sitting place] in a calm and quiet position.",

This system is explained in our Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is, in the chapter entitled \u201cDhy\u0101na-yoga.\u201d It is understood that in a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga one practices settling the mind and then concentrating it on the form of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, as will be described in the following verses. It is clearly stated here that a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga is not a bodily gymnastic exercise, but a practice to concentrate the mind on the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Before sitting on his \u0101sana, which is also described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one has to cleanse himself very nicely in clear or sacred water thrice daily. The water of the Yamun\u0101 is naturally very clear and pure, and thus if anyone bathes there three times, undoubtedly he will be very greatly purified externally. N\u0101rada Muni, therefore, instructed Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to go to the bank of the Yamun\u0101 and thus become externally purified. This is part of the gradual process of practicing mystic yoga."

The mind, by nature, is always oscillating, for it is very fickle, but the breathing exercise is meant to control it. This process of controlling the mind might have been very possible in those days millions of years ago when Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja took to it, but at the present moment the mind has to be fixed directly on the lotus feet of the Lord by the chanting process. By chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra one immediately concentrates on the sound vibration and thinks of the lotus feet of the Lord, and very quickly one is elevated to the position of sam\u0101dhi, or trance. If one goes on chanting the holy names of the Lord, which are not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, naturally his mind becomes absorbed in thought of the Lord. It is here recommended to Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that he meditate on the supreme guru, or supreme spiritual master. The supreme spiritual master is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is therefore known as caitya-guru. This refers to the Supersoul, who is sitting in everyone\u2019s heart. He helps from within as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and He sends the spiritual master, who helps from without. The spiritual master is the external manifestation of the caitya-guru, or the spiritual master sitting in everyone\u2019s heart. The process by which we give up our thoughts of material things is called praty\u0101h\u0101ra, which entails being freed from all material thoughts and engagements. The word abhidhy\u0101yet, which is used in this verse, indicates that unless one\u2019s mind is fixed, one cannot meditate. The conclusion, therefore, is that meditation means thinking of the Lord within. Whether one comes to that stage by the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga system or by the method recommended in the \u015b\u0101stras especially for this present age \u2014 to constantly chant the holy name of the Lord \u2014 the goal is to meditate on the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " This verse clearly explains how one has to meditate on the form of the Lord. Impersonal meditation is a bogus invention of modern days. In none of the Vedic literatures is impersonal meditation recommended. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, when meditation is recommended, the word mat-para\u1e25, which means \u201cpertaining to Me,\u201d is used. Any Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form pertains to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form. Sometimes someone tries to meditate upon the impersonal Brahman, which is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as avyakta, meaning \u201cunmanifested\u201d or \u201cimpersonal.\u201d But it is remarked by the Lord Himself that those who are attached to this impersonal feature of the Lord suffer a very troublesome task because no one can concentrate on the impersonal feature. One has to concentrate on the form of the Lord, which is described here in connection with Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s meditation. As will be apparent from later descriptions, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja perfected this kind of meditation, and his yoga was successful."

The Lord is always worthy to be the master of the surrendered soul, for He is the ocean of mercy.",
        "purport": " Everyone has to surrender to someone superior. That is always the nature of our living condition. At the present moment we are trying to surrender to someone \u2014 either to society or to our nation, family, state or government. The surrendering process already exists, but it is never perfect because the person or institution unto whom we surrender is imperfect, and our surrender, having so many ulterior motives, is also imperfect. As such, in the material world no one is worthy to accept anyone\u2019s surrender, nor does anyone fully surrender to anyone else unless obliged to do so. But here the surrendering process is voluntary, and the Lord is worthy to accept the surrender. This surrender by the living entity occurs automatically as soon as he sees the beautiful youthful nature of the Lord. The description given by N\u0101rada Muni is not imaginary. The form of the Lord is understood by the parampar\u0101 system. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers say that we have to imagine the form of the Lord, but here N\u0101rada Muni does not say that. Rather, he gives the description of the Lord from authoritative sources. He is himself an authority, and he is able to go to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka and see the Lord personally; therefore his description of the bodily features of the Lord is not an imagination. Sometimes we give instructions to our students about the bodily features of the Lord, and they paint Him. Their paintings are not imaginary. The description is given through disciplic succession, just like that given by N\u0101rada Muni, who sees the Lord and describes His bodily features. Therefore such descriptions should be accepted, and if they are painted, that is not imaginative painting."

        "purport": " Within this universe there is a planet called Siddhaloka. The inhabitants of Siddhaloka are by nature perfect in the yoga achievements, which are of eight varieties: one can become smaller than the smallest, lighter than the lightest, or bigger than the biggest; one can immediately get whatever he likes, one can even create a planet, etc. These are some of the yogic perfections. By virtue of the laghim\u0101-siddhi, or purificatory process to become lighter than the lightest, the inhabitants of Siddhaloka can fly in the sky without airplanes or airships. It is hinted herein by N\u0101rada Muni to Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that by meditating upon the transcendental form of the Lord and at the same time chanting the mantra one becomes so perfect within seven days that he can see the human beings who fly in the sky. N\u0101rada Muni uses the word japa\u1e25, which indicates that the mantra to be chanted is very confidential. One may ask, \u201cIf it is confidential, why is it mentioned in the writing of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam?\u201d It is confidential in this sense: one may receive a published mantra anywhere, but unless it is accepted through the chain of disciplic succession, the mantra does not act. It is said by authoritative sources that any mantra chanted without having been received from the disciplic succession has no efficacy. Another point established in this verse is that meditation should be carried on with the chanting of a mantra. Chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra is the easiest process of meditation in this age. As soon as one chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, he sees the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, R\u0101ma and Their energies, and that is the perfect stage of trance. One should not artificially try to see the form of the Lord while chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but when the chanting is performed offenselessly the Lord will automatically reveal Himself to the view of the chanter. Therefore the chanter has to concentrate on hearing the vibration, and without extra endeavor on his part, the Lord will automatically appear."

One should install the physical forms of the Lord, and with the chanting of the mantra one should offer flowers and fruits and other varieties of foodstuffs exactly according to the rules and regulations prescribed by authorities. But this should be done in consideration of place, time, and attendant conveniences and inconveniences.",
        "purport": " O\u1e41 namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya is known as the dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101k\u1e63ara-mantra. This mantra is chanted by Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotees, and it begins with pra\u1e47ava, or o\u1e41k\u0101ra. There is an injunction that those who are not br\u0101hma\u1e47as cannot pronounce the pra\u1e47ava mantra. But Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was born a k\u1e63atriya. He at once admitted before N\u0101rada Muni that as a k\u1e63atriya he was unable to accept N\u0101rada\u2019s instruction of renunciation and mental equilibrium, which are the concern of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Still, although not a br\u0101hma\u1e47a but a k\u1e63atriya, Dhruva was allowed, on the authority of N\u0101rada, to pronounce the pra\u1e47ava o\u1e41k\u0101ra. This is very significant. Especially in India, the caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as object greatly when persons from other castes, who are not born in br\u0101hma\u1e47a families, recite this pra\u1e47ava mantra. But here is tacit proof that if a person accepts the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava mantra or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava way of worshiping the Deity, he is allowed to chant the pra\u1e47ava mantra. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord personally accepts that anyone, even one of a low species, can be elevated to the highest position and go back home, back to Godhead, simply if he worships properly. The prescribed rules, as stated here by N\u0101rada Muni, are that one should accept the mantra through a bona fide spiritual master and hear the mantra in the right ear. Not only should one chant or murmur the mantra, but in front of him he must have the Deity, or physical form of the Lord. Of course, when the Lord appears it is no longer a physical form. For example, when an iron rod is made red-hot in a fire, it is no longer iron; it is fire. Similarly, when we make a form of the Lord \u2014 whether of wood or stone or metal or jewels or paint, or even a form within the mind \u2014 it is a bona fide, spiritual, transcendental form of the Lord. Not only must one receive the mantra from the bona fide spiritual master like N\u0101rada Muni or his representative in the disciplic succession, but one must chant the mantra. And not only must one chant, but he should also offer whatever foodstuff is available in his part of the world, according to time and convenience. The method of worship \u2014 chanting the mantra and preparing the forms of the Lord \u2014 is not stereotyped, nor is it exactly the same everywhere. It is specifically mentioned in this verse that one should take consideration of the time, place and available conveniences. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is going on throughout the entire world, and we also install Deities in different centers. Sometimes our Indian friends, puffed up with concocted notions, criticize, \u201cThis has not been done. That has not been done.\u201d But they forget this instruction of N\u0101rada Muni to one of the greatest Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. One has to consider the particular time, country and conveniences. What is convenient in India may not be convenient in the Western countries. Those who are not actually in the line of \u0101c\u0101ryas, or who personally have no knowledge of how to act in the role of \u0101c\u0101rya, unnecessarily criticize the activities of the ISKCON movement in countries outside of India. The fact is that such critics cannot do anything personally to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If someone does go and preach, taking all risks and allowing all considerations for time and place, it might be that there are changes in the manner of worship, but that is not at all faulty according to \u015b\u0101stra. \u015ar\u012bmad V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya, an \u0101c\u0101rya in the disciplic succession of the R\u0101m\u0101nuja samprad\u0101ya, has remarked in his commentary that ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las, or conditioned souls who are born in lower than \u015b\u016bdra families, can also be initiated according to circumstances. The formalities may be slightly changed here and there to make them Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu recommends that His name should be heard in every nook and corner of the world. How is this possible unless one preaches everywhere? The cult of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is bh\u0101gavata-dharma, and He especially recommends k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, or the cult of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. He recommends that every Indian, considering this task to be para-upak\u0101ra, or welfare activity, take the Lord\u2019s message to other residents of the world. \u201cOther residents of the world\u201d does not refer only to those who are exactly like the Indian br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas, or like the caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who claim to be br\u0101hma\u1e47as because they were born in the families of br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The principle that only Indians and Hindus should be brought into the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava cult is a mistaken idea. There should be propaganda to bring everyone to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava cult. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is meant for this purpose. There is no bar to propagating the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement even among people who are born in ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la, mleccha or yavana families. Even in India, this point has been enunciated by \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his book Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa, which is sm\u1e5bti and is the authorized Vedic guide for Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas in their daily behavior. San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that as bell metal can turn to gold when mixed with mercury in a chemical process, so, by the bona fide d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101, or initiation method, anyone can become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. One should take initiation from a bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic succession, who is authorized by his predecessor spiritual master. This is called d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101-vidh\u0101na. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, vyap\u0101\u015britya: one should accept a spiritual master. By this process the entire world can be converted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " It is specifically mentioned herein that tulas\u012b leaves are very dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and devotees should take particular care to have tulas\u012b leaves in every temple and center of worship. In the Western countries, while engaged in propagating the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, we were brought great unhappiness because we could not find tulas\u012b leaves. Therefore we are very much obliged to our disciple \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Govinda d\u0101s\u012b because she has taken much care to grow tulas\u012b plants from seeds, and she has been successful by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Now tulas\u012b plants are growing in almost every center of our movement. Tulas\u012b leaves are very important in the method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse the word salilai\u1e25 means \u201cby the water.\u201d Of course, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was worshiping on the bank of the Yamun\u0101. The Yamun\u0101 and the Ganges are sacred, and sometimes devotees in India insist that the Deity must be worshiped with water of the Ganges or Yamun\u0101. But here we understand de\u015ba-k\u0101la to mean \u201caccording to time and country.\u201d In the Western countries there is no river Yamun\u0101 or Ganges \u2014 water from such sacred rivers is not available. Does this mean that the arc\u0101 worship should for that reason be stopped? No. Salilai\u1e25 refers to any water \u2014 whatever is available \u2014 but it must be very clear and collected purely. That water can be used. The other paraphernalia, such as flower garlands, fruits and vegetables, should be collected according to the country and according to their availability. Tulas\u012b leaves are very important for satisfying the Lord, so as far as possible an arrangement should be made for growing tulas\u012b leaves. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was advised to worship the Lord with the fruits and flowers available in the forest. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a frankly says that He accepts vegetables, fruits, flowers, etc. One should not offer Lord V\u0101sudeva anything other than what is prescribed herein by the great authority N\u0101rada Muni. One cannot offer to the Deity according to one\u2019s whims. Since these fruits and vegetables are available anywhere in the universe, we should observe this small point very attentively."

In the forest one can make a form with no more than earth and water and worship Him according to the above principles. A devotee who has full control over his self should be very sober and peaceful and must be satisfied simply with eating whatever fruits and vegetables are available in the forest.",
        "purport": " It is essential for a devotee to worship the form of the Lord and not only meditate upon the form of the Lord within his mind with the chanting of the mantra given by the spiritual master. The worship of the form must be present. The impersonalist takes unnecessary trouble to meditate upon or worship something impersonal, and the path is very precarious. We are not advised to follow the impersonalist way of meditating on or worshiping the Lord. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was advised to worship a form made of earth and water because in the jungle, if it is not possible to have a form made of metal, wood or stone, the best process is to take earth mixed with water and make a form of the Lord and worship Him. The devotee should not be anxious about cooking food; whatever is available in the forest or in the city among the fruit and vegetable groups should be offered to the Deity, and the devotee should be satisfied eating that. He should not be anxious to have very palatable dishes. Of course, wherever it is possible one should offer the Deities the best foodstuffs, prepared within the category of fruits and vegetables, cooked or uncooked. The important factor is that the devotee should be regulated (mita-bhuk); that is one of the good qualifications of a devotee. He should not hanker to satisfy the tongue with a particular kind of foodstuff. He should be satisfied to eat whatever pras\u0101da is available by the grace of the Lord."

        "translation": "My dear Dhruva, besides worshiping the Deity and chanting the mantra three times a day, you should meditate upon the transcendental activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different incarnations, as exhibited by His supreme will and personal potencies.",
        "purport": " Devotional service comprises nine prescribed practices \u2014 hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving, offering everything to the Deity, etc. Here Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is advised not only to meditate on the form of the Lord, but to think of His transcendental pastimes in His different incarnations. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers take the incarnation of the Lord to be in the same category as the ordinary living entity. This is a great mistake. The incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not forced to act by the material laws of nature. The word svecch\u0101 is used here to indicate that He appears out of His supreme will. The conditioned soul is forced to accept a particular type of body according to his karma given by the laws of material nature under the direction of the Supreme Lord. But when the Lord appears, He is not forced by the dictation of material nature; He appears as He likes by His own internal potency. That is the difference. The conditioned soul accepts a particular type of body, such as the body of a hog, by his work and by the superior authority of material nature. But when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in the incarnation of a boar, He is not the same kind of hog as an ordinary animal. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears as Var\u0101ha-avat\u0101ra in an expansive feature which cannot be compared to an ordinary hog\u2019s. His appearance and disappearance are inconceivable to us. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly said that He appears by His own internal potency for the protection of the devotees and the annihilation of the nondevotees. A devotee should always consider that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not appear as an ordinary human being or ordinary beast; His appearance as Var\u0101ha-m\u016brti or a horse or tortoise is an exhibition of His internal potency. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said, \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibh\u0101vit\u0101bhi\u1e25: one should not mistake the appearance of the Lord as a human being or a beast to be the same as the birth of an ordinary conditioned soul, who is forced to appear by the laws of nature, whether as an animal, as a human being or as a demigod. This kind of thinking is offensive. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has condemned the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs as offensive to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because of their thinking that the Lord and the conditioned living entities are one and the same. N\u0101rada advises Dhruva to meditate on the pastimes of the Lord, which is as good as the meditation of concentrating one\u2019s mind on the form of the Lord. As meditation on any form of the Lord is valuable, so is chanting of different names of the Lord, such as Hari, Govinda and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. But in this age we are especially advised to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra as enunciated in the \u015b\u0101stra: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."

        "purport": " There are different stages of perfection according to different persons\u2019 objectives. Generally people are karm\u012bs, for they engage in activities of sense gratification. Above the karm\u012bs are the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, who are trying to become liberated from material entanglement. Yog\u012bs are still more advanced because they meditate on the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And above all these are the devotees, who simply engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord; they are situated seriously on the topmost platform of ecstasy. Here Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is advised that if he has no desire for sense gratification, then he should directly engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The path of apavarga, or liberation, begins from the stage called mok\u1e63a. In this verse the word vimuktaye, \u201cfor liberation,\u201d is especially mentioned. If one wants to be happy within this material world, he may aspire to go to the different material planetary systems where there is a higher standard of sense gratification, but real mok\u1e63a, or liberation, is performed without any such desire. This is explained in the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu by the term any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam, \u201cwithout desire for material sense gratification.\u201d For persons who are still inclined to enjoy material life in different stages or on different planets, the stage of liberation in bhakti-yoga is not recommended. Only persons who are completely free from the contamination of sense gratification can execute bhakti-yoga, or the process of devotional service, very purely. The activities on the path of apavarga up to the stages of dharma, artha and k\u0101ma are meant for sense gratification, but when one comes to the stage of mok\u1e63a, the impersonalist liberation, the practitioner wants to merge into the existence of the Supreme. But that is also sense gratification. When one goes above the stage of liberation, however, he at once becomes one of the associates of the Lord to render transcendental loving service. That is technically called vimukti. For this specific vimukti liberation, N\u0101rada Muni recommends that one directly engage himself in devotional service."

He was too attached to the second wife, however, so he could not behave well with Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. That was the cause of Dhruva\u2019s leaving home to perform austerities. Although as a father the King was affectionate toward his son, he minimized his affection for Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja because he was too much addicted to the second wife. Now he was repenting that both Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and his mother, Sun\u012bti, were practically banished. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja went to the forest, and since his mother was being neglected by the King, she was therefore almost banished also. The King repented having banished his boy, for Dhruva was only five years old, and a father should not banish his wife and children or neglect their maintenance. Repentant over his neglect of both Sun\u012bti and her son, he was morose, and his face appeared withered. According to Manu-sm\u1e5bti, one should never desert his wife and children. In a case where the wife and children are disobedient and do not follow the principles of home life, they are sometimes given up. But in the case of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja this was not applicable because Dhruva was very mannerly and obedient. Moreover, he was a great devotee. Such a person is never to be neglected, yet the King was obliged to banish him. Now he was very sorry."

Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is also described here as prabhu because he is an \u0101c\u0101rya of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava school. Another meaning of prabhu is \u201cmaster of the senses,\u201d just like the word sv\u0101m\u012b. Another significant word is sudu\u1e63karam, \u201cvery difficult to perform.\u201d What was the task that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja undertook? The most difficult task in life is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja would be able to do that. We must remember that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was not fickle; he was determined to execute his service and then come back. Every devotee, therefore, should be determined that in this life he will be able to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by that process go back home, back to Godhead. That is the perfection of the highest mission of life."

        "purport": " Kapittha is a flower which is known in Indian vernacular as kayeta. We do not find an English equivalent for the name of this flower, but its fruit is generally not accepted by human beings; it is eaten by monkeys in the forest. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, accepted such fruits, not for luxurious feasting but just to keep his body and soul together. The body needs food, but a devotee should not accept foodstuff to satisfy the tongue in sense gratification. It is recommended in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that one should accept as much food as necessary to keep the body fit, but one should not eat for luxury. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is an \u0101c\u0101rya, and by undergoing severe austerities and penances he teaches us how one should execute devotional service. We must carefully know the process of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s service; how severely he passed his days will be shown in later verses. We should always remember that to become a bona fide devotee of the Lord is not an easy task, but in this age, by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, it has been made very easy. But if we do not follow even the liberal instructions of Lord Caitanya, how can we expect to discharge our regular duties in devotional service? It is not possible in this age to follow Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja in his austerity, but the principles must be followed; we should not disregard the regulative principles given by our spiritual master, for they make it easier for the conditioned soul. As far as our ISKCON movement is concerned, we simply ask that one observe the four prohibitive rules, chant sixteen rounds and, instead of indulging in luxurious eating for the tongue, simply accept pras\u0101da offered to the Lord. This does not mean that with our fasting the Lord should also fast. The Lord should be given foodstuff which is as nice as possible. But we should not make it a point to satisfy our own tongue. As far as possible we should accept simple foodstuff, just to keep the body and soul together to execute devotional service. It is our duty to remember always that in comparison to Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja we are insignificant. We cannot do anything like what Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did for self-realization because we are absolutely incompetent to execute such service. But by Lord Caitanya\u2019s mercy we have been given all concessions possible for this age, so at least we should always remember that neglect of our prescribed duties in devotional service will not make us successful in the mission we have undertaken. It is our duty to follow in the footsteps of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, for he was very determined. We should also be determined to finish our duties in executing devotional service in this life; we should not wait for another life to finish our job."

        "translation": "When Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja thus captured the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the refuge of the total material creation and who is the master of all living entities, the three worlds began to tremble.",
        "purport": " In this verse the particular word brahma is very significant. Brahman refers to one who not only is the greatest, but has the potency to expand to an unlimited extent. How was it possible for Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to capture Brahman within his heart? This question has been very nicely answered by J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. He says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of Brahman, for since He comprises everything material and spiritual, there cannot be anything greater than He. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also the Supreme Godhead says, \u201cI am the resting place of Brahman.\u201d Many persons, especially the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, consider Brahman the biggest, all-expanding substance, but according to this verse and other Vedic literatures, such as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the resting place of Brahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the resting place of the sunshine is the sun globe. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b therefore says that since the transcendental form of the Lord is the seed of all greatness, He is the Supreme Brahman. Since the Supreme Brahman was situated in the heart of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, he became heavier than the heaviest, and therefore everything trembled in all three worlds and in the spiritual world. The mahat-tattva, or the sum total of the material creation, is to be understood to be the ultimate end of all universes, including all the living entities therein. Brahman is the resort of the mahat-tattva, which includes all material and spiritual entities. It is described in this connection that the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, is the master of both pradh\u0101na and puru\u1e63a. Pradh\u0101na means subtle matter, such as ether. Puru\u1e63a means the spiritual-spark living entities who are entangled in that subtle material existence. These may also be described as par\u0101 prak\u1e5bti and apar\u0101 prak\u1e5bti, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the controller of both the prak\u1e5btis, is thus the master of pradh\u0101na and puru\u1e63a. In the Vedic hymns also the Supreme Brahman is described as anta\u1e25-pravi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 \u015b\u0101st\u0101. This indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is controlling everything and entering into everything. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.35) further confirms this. A\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham: He has entered not only the universes, but even the atom. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.42) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also says, vi\u1e63\u1e6dabhy\u0101ham ida\u1e41 k\u1e5btsnam. The Supreme Personality of Godhead controls everything by entering into everything. By associating constantly with the Supreme Personality in his heart, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja naturally became equal to the greatest, Brahman, by His association, and thus became the heaviest, and the entire universe trembled. In conclusion, a person who always concentrates on the transcendental form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within his heart can very easily strike the whole world with wonder at his activities. This is the perfection of yoga performance, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.47). Yogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m: of all yog\u012bs, the bhakti-yog\u012b, who thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always within his heart and engages in His loving transcendental service, is the topmost. Ordinary yog\u012bs can exhibit wonderful material activities, known as a\u1e63\u1e6da-siddhi, eight kinds of yogic perfection, but a pure devotee of the Lord can surpass these perfections by performing activities which can make the whole universe tremble."

But when he became advanced in self-realization, or devotional service, by the pressure of his toe he could push down the whole earth.

In ordinary consciousness a king\u2019s son may be refused something even by his father, but when the same person becomes fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious within his heart, he can push down the earth with the pressure of his toe. One cannot argue, \u201cHow is it that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who was prevented from getting up on the lap of his father, could press down the whole earth?\u201d This argument is not very much appreciated by the learned, for it is an example of nagna-m\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101 logic. By this logic one would think that because his mother in her childhood was naked, she should remain naked even when she is grown up. The stepmother of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja might have been thinking in a similar way: since she had refused to allow him to get up on the lap of his father, how could Dhruva perform such wonderful activities as pressing down the whole earth? She must have been very surprised when she learned that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, by concentrating constantly on the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, could press down the entire earth, like an elephant who presses down the boat on which it is loaded."

        "purport": " When hundreds of persons are sitting in an airplane, although they remain individual units they each share in the total force of the airplane, which runs at thousands of miles per hour. Similarly, when unit energy is identified with the service of the total energy, the unit energy becomes as powerful as the total energy. As explained in the previous verse, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, because of his spiritual advancement, became almost the total heaviness, and thus he pressed down the whole earth. Moreover, by such spiritual power his unit body became the total body of the universe. Thus when he closed the holes of his unit body to firmly concentrate his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all the units of the universe \u2014 namely all the living entities, including the big demigods \u2014 felt the pressure of suffocation, as if their breathing were being choked. Therefore they all took shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they were perplexed as to what had happened. This example of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s closing the holes of his personal body and thereby closing the breathing holes of the total universe clearly indicates that a devotee, by his personal devotional service, can influence all the people of the whole world to become devotees of the Lord. lf there is only one pure devotee in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can change the total consciousness of the world into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is not very difficult to understand if we study the behavior of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja."

Because of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s controlling his breathing, the entire universal breathing process was choked. It is by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that material entities cannot breathe whereas spiritual entities are able to breathe; material entities are products of the Lord\u2019s external energy, whereas spiritual entities are products of the Lord\u2019s internal energy. The demigods approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the controller of both kinds of entities, in order to know why their breathing was choked. The Supreme Lord is the ultimate goal for the solution to all problems within this material world. In the spiritual world there are no problems, but the material world is always problematic. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of both the material and spiritual worlds, it is better to approach Him in all problematic situations.

The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers want to prove by this word that the Supersoul and the individual soul become united in this way and that after such unification the individual soul has no separate existence. But here it is clearly said by the Supreme Lord that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was so absorbed in meditation on the thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that He Himself, the universal consciousness, was attracted to Dhruva. In order to please the demigods, He wanted to go Himself to Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to stop him from this severe austerity. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers\u2019 conclusion that the Supersoul and the individual soul become united is not supported by this statement. Rather, the Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead, wanted to stop Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja from this severe austerity. By pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one pleases everyone, just as by watering the root of a tree one satisfies every branch, twig and leaf of the tree. If one can attract the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one naturally attracts the whole universe because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme cause of the universe. All the demigods were afraid of being totally vanquished by suffocation, but the Personality of Godhead assured them that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a great devotee of the Lord and was not about to annihilate everyone in the universe. A devotee is never envious of other living entities."
