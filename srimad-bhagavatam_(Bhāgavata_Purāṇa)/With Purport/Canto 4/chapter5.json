        "purport": " Lord \u015aiva understood that Sat\u012b, being the youngest daughter of Dak\u1e63a, could present the case of Lord \u015aiva\u2019s purity of purpose and would thus be able to mitigate the misunderstanding between Dak\u1e63a and himself. But such a compromise was not attained, and Sat\u012b was deliberately insulted by her father by not being received properly when she visited his house without being invited. Sat\u012b herself could have killed her father, Dak\u1e63a, because she is the personified material energy and has immense power to kill and create within this material universe. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 her strength is described: she is capable of creating and dissolving many universes. But although she is so powerful, she acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as His shadow. It would not have been difficult for Sat\u012b to punish her father, but she thought that since she was his daughter, it was not proper for her to kill him. Thus she decided to give up her own body, which she had obtained from his, and Dak\u1e63a did not even check her. When Sat\u012b passed away, giving up her body, the news was conveyed by N\u0101rada to Lord \u015aiva. N\u0101rada always carries the news of such events because he knows their import. When Lord \u015aiva heard that his chaste wife, Sat\u012b, was dead, he naturally became exceedingly angry. He also understood that Bh\u1e5bgu Muni had created the \u1e5abhudeva demigods by uttering the mantras of the Yajur Veda and that these demigods had driven away all of his soldiers who were present in the arena of sacrifice. Therefore he wanted to reply to this insult, and thus he decided to kill Dak\u1e63a because he was the cause of the death of Sat\u012b."

Although pure goodness, or \u015buddha-sattva, is the basic principle in the spiritual world, pure manifestation of goodness is not possible in this material world. Thus, the struggle for existence between different material qualities is always present.

When, in the name of justice, thieves are allowed liberty, the state and kingdom are disturbed by such plunderers and unwanted population. The dust storm created by the soldiers and assistants of Lord \u015aiva resembled the situation at the time of the dissolution of this world.

        "purport": " Pras\u016bti, who appreciated the power and strength of her son-in-law, Lord \u015aiva, is describing what he does at the time of dissolution. This description indicates that the strength of Lord \u015aiva is so great that Dak\u1e63a\u2019s power could not be set in comparison to it. At the time of dissolution, Lord \u015aiva, with his trident in hand, dances over the rulers of the different planets, and his hair is scattered, just as the clouds are scattered over all directions in order to plunge the different planets into incessant torrents of rain. In the last phase of dissolution, all the planets become inundated with water, and that inundation is caused by the dancing of Lord \u015aiva. This dance is called the pralaya dance, or dance of dissolution. Pras\u016bti could understand that the dangers ahead resulted not only from Dak\u1e63a\u2019s having neglected her daughter, but also because of his neglecting the prestige and honor of Lord \u015aiva."

V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya has indicated that this word mah\u0101tm\u0101 means \u201csteady in heart.\u201d That is to say that Dak\u1e63a was so stronghearted that even when his beloved daughter was prepared to lay down her life, he was steady and unshaken. But in spite of his being so stronghearted, he was perturbed when he saw the various disturbances created by the gigantic black demon. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks in this connection that even if one is called mah\u0101tm\u0101, a great soul, unless he exhibits the symptoms of a mah\u0101tm\u0101, he should be considered a dur\u0101tm\u0101, or a degraded soul. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.13) the word mah\u0101tm\u0101 describes the pure devotee of the Lord: mah\u0101tm\u0101nas tu m\u0101\u1e41 p\u0101rtha daiv\u012b\u1e41 prak\u1e5btim \u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25. A mah\u0101tm\u0101 is always under the guidance of the internal energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus how could such a misbehaved person as Dak\u1e63a be a mah\u0101tm\u0101? A mah\u0101tm\u0101 is supposed to have all the good qualities of the demigods, and thus Dak\u1e63a, lacking those qualities, could not be called a mah\u0101tm\u0101; he should instead be called dur\u0101tm\u0101, a degraded soul. The word mah\u0101tm\u0101 to describe the qualifications of Dak\u1e63a is used sarcastically."

Just as he was to be punished for the kidnapping, the soldiers from Dv\u0101rak\u0101 arrived, headed by Balar\u0101ma, and a fight ensued amongst the k\u1e63atriyas. This sort of fight was very common, especially during marriage ceremonies, when everyone was in a challenging spirit. In that challenging spirit, a fight was sure to occur, and in such fights there was commonly killing and misfortune. After finishing such fighting, the parties would come to a compromise, and everything would be settled. This Dak\u1e63a yaj\u00f1a was similar to such events. Now all of them \u2014 Dak\u1e63a and the demigods Bhaga and P\u016b\u1e63\u0101 and Bh\u1e5bgu Muni \u2014 were punished by the soldiers of Lord \u015aiva, but later everything would come to a peaceful end. So this spirit of fighting between one another was not exactly inimical. Because everyone was so powerful and wanted to show his strength by Vedic mantra or mystic power, all these fighting skills were very elaborately exhibited by the different parties at the Dak\u1e63a yaj\u00f1a."

The killing was specifically intended to give a new life to the sacrificed animal by the power of Vedic mantra. The animals were sacrificed to test the strength of Vedic mantras; yaj\u00f1as were performed as a test of the mantra. Even in the modern age, tests are executed on animal bodies in the physiology laboratory. Similarly, whether or not the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were uttering the Vedic hymns correctly was tested by sacrifice in the arena. On the whole, the animals thus sacrificed were not at all the losers. Some old animals would be sacrificed, but in exchange for their old bodies they received other, new bodies. That was the test of Vedic mantras. V\u012brabhadra, instead of sacrificing animals with the wooden device, immediately beheaded Dak\u1e63a, to the astonishment of everyone."
