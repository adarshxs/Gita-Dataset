Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was perturbed, but upon opening his eyes and breaking his meditation he saw the same form of the Lord before him. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38) it is said, prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena: a saintly person who has developed love of Godhead by devotional service always sees the Lord\u2019s transcendental form of \u015ay\u0101masundara. This \u015ay\u0101masundara form of the Lord within the heart of a devotee is not imaginary. When a devotee becomes mature in his prosecution of devotional service, he sees face to face the same \u015ay\u0101masundara he has thought of during the entire course of his devotional service.

Devotees are always interested in hearing about the Lord\u2019s transcendental qualities, and they are always eager to glorify these qualities, but sometimes they feel inconvenienced by humbleness. The Personality of Godhead, being situated in everyone\u2019s heart, specifically gives a devotee intelligence to describe Him. It is therefore understood that when a devotee writes or speaks about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his words are dictated by the Lord from within. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Tenth Chapter: to those who constantly engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the Lord, from within, dictates what to do next in order to serve Him. When Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja felt hesitant, not knowing how to describe the Lord for want of sufficient experience, the Lord, out of His causeless mercy, touched His conchshell to Dhruva\u2019s forehead, and he was transcendentally inspired. This transcendental inspiration is called brahma-maya because when one is thus inspired, the sound he produces exactly corresponds to the sound vibration of the Vedas. This is not the ordinary sound vibration of this material world. Therefore the sound vibration of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, although presented in the ordinary alphabet, should not be taken as mundane or material."

In accordance with the line of devotional service to the Supreme Lord, whose fame is widespread, Dhruva, who in the future would receive a planet which would never be annihilated, even during the time of dissolution, offered his deliberate and conclusive prayers.",
        "purport": " There are many important items to be considered in this verse. First of all, the relationship between the Absolute Truth and the relative material and spiritual energies is here understood by a student who has complete knowledge of the Vedic literature. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja never went to any school or academic teacher to learn the Vedic conclusion, but because of his devotional service to the Lord, as soon as the Lord appeared and touched his forehead with His conchshell, automatically the entire Vedic conclusion was revealed to him. That is the process of understanding Vedic literature. One cannot understand it simply by academic learning. The Vedas indicate that only to one who has unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord as well as in the spiritual master is the Vedic conclusion revealed. The example of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is that he engaged himself in devotional service to the Lord according to the order of his spiritual master, N\u0101rada Muni. As a result of his rendering such devotional service with great determination and austerity, the Personality of Godhead personally manifested Himself before him. Dhruva was only a child. He wanted to offer nice prayers to the Lord, but because he lacked sufficient knowledge, he hesitated; but by the mercy of the Lord, as soon as the Lord\u2019s conchshell touched his forehead, he became completely aware of the Vedic conclusion. That conclusion is based on proper understanding of the difference between j\u012bva and Param\u0101tm\u0101, the individual soul and the Supersoul. The individual soul is forever a servant of the Supersoul, and therefore his relationship with the Supersoul is to offer service. That is called bhakti-yoga, or bhakti-bh\u0101va. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja offered his prayers to the Lord not in the way of the impersonalist philosophers, but as a devotee. Therefore it is clearly said here, bhakti-bh\u0101va. The only prayers worth offering are those offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose reputation is spread far and wide. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted to have the kingdom of his father, but his father refused even to allow him to get on his lap. In order to fulfill his desire, the Lord had already created a planet known as the polestar, Dhruvaloka, which was never to be annihilated even at the time of the dissolution of the universe. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja attained this perfection not by acting hastily, but by patiently executing the order of his spiritual master, and therefore he became so successful that he saw the Lord face to face. Now he was further enabled, by the causeless mercy of the Lord, to offer fitting prayers to the Lord. To glorify or offer prayers unto the Supreme, one needs the Lord\u2019s mercy. One cannot write to glorify the Lord unless one is endowed with His causeless mercy."

        "translation": "Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said: My dear Lord, You are all-powerful. After entering within me, You have enlivened all my sleeping senses \u2014 my hands, legs, ears, touch sensation, life force and especially my power of speech. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",
        "purport": " Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja could understand very easily the difference between his condition before and after attaining spiritual realization and seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He could understand that his life force and activities had been sleeping. Unless one comes to the spiritual platform, his bodily limbs, mind and other facilities within the body are understood to be sleeping. Unless one is spiritually situated, all his activities are taken as a dead man\u2019s activities or ghostly activities. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has composed a song in which he addresses himself: \u201cO living entity, get up! How long shall you sleep on the lap of m\u0101y\u0101? Now you have the opportunity of possessing a human form of body; now try to get up and realize yourself.\u201d The Vedas also declare, \u201cGet up! Get up! You have the opportunity, the boon of the human form of life \u2014 now realize yourself.\u201d These are the Vedic injunctions. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja actually experienced that upon enlightenment of his senses on the spiritual platform he could understand the essence of Vedic instruction \u2014 that the Supreme Godhead is the Supreme Person; He is not impersonal. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja could immediately understand this fact. He was aware that for a very long time he was practically sleeping, and he felt the impetus to glorify the Lord according to the Vedic conclusion. A mundane person cannot offer any prayer or glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because he has no realization of the Vedic conclusion. Therefore when Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja found this difference within himself, he could immediately understand that it was because of the causeless mercy of the Lord. He offered obeisances to the Lord with great respect and reverence, completely understanding that the Lord\u2019s favor was upon him. This spiritual enlivenment of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s senses and mind was due to the action of the internal potency of the Lord. In this verse, therefore, the word sva-dh\u0101mn\u0101 means \u201cby spiritual energy.\u201d Spiritual enlightenment is possible by the mercy of the spiritual energy of the Lord. The chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra is first addressed to the spiritual energy of the Lord, Hare. This spiritual energy acts when a living entity fully surrenders and accepts his position as an eternal servitor. When a person places himself at the disposal or order of the Supreme Lord, that is called sevonmukha; at that time the spiritual energy gradually reveals the Lord to him. Without revelation by the spiritual energy, one is unable to offer prayers glorifying the Lord. Any amount of philosophical speculation or poetic expression by mundane persons is still considered to be the action and reaction of the material energy. When one is actually enlivened by the spiritual energy, all his senses become purified, and he engages only in the service of the Lord. At that time his hands, legs, ears, tongue, mind, genitals \u2014 everything \u2014 engage in the service of the Lord. Such an enlightened devotee no longer has any material activities, nor has he any interest in being materially engaged. This process of purifying the senses and engaging them in the service of the Lord is known as bhakti, or devotional service. In the beginning, the senses are engaged by the direction of the spiritual master and \u015b\u0101stra, and after realization, when the same senses are purified, the engagement continues. The difference is that in the beginning the senses are engaged in a mechanical way, but after realization they are engaged in spiritual understanding."

You create the total energy of the material world by Your external potency, and after creation You enter within the material world as the Supersoul. You are the Supreme Person, and through the temporary modes of material nature You create varieties of manifestation, just as fire, entering into wood of different shapes, burns brilliantly in different varieties.",
        "purport": " Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja realized that the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, acts through His different energies, not that He becomes void or impersonal and thus becomes all-pervading. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosopher thinks that the Absolute Truth, being spread throughout the cosmic manifestation, has no personal form. But here Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, upon realization of the Vedic conclusion, says, \u201cYou are spread all over the cosmic manifestation by Your energy.\u201d This energy is basically spiritual, but because it acts in the material world temporarily, it is called m\u0101y\u0101, or illusory energy. In other words, for everyone but the devotees the Lord\u2019s energy acts as external energy. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja could understand this fact very nicely, and he could understand also that the energy and the energetic are one and the same. The energy cannot be separated from the energetic. The identity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the feature of Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul, is admitted herein. His original, spiritual energy enlivens the material energy, and thus the dead body appears to have life force. Voidist philosophers think that under certain material conditions the symptoms of life occur in the material body, but the fact is that the material body cannot act on its own. Even a machine needs separate energy (electricity, steam, etc.). It is stated in this verse that the material energy acts in varieties of material bodies, just as fire burns differently in different wood according to the size and quality of the wood. In the case of devotees the same energy is transformed into spiritual energy; this is possible because the energy is originally spiritual, not material. As it is said, vi\u1e63\u1e47u-\u015bakti\u1e25 par\u0101 prokt\u0101. The original energy inspires a devotee, and thus he engages all his bodily limbs in the service of the Lord. The same energy, as external potency, engages the ordinary nondevotees in material activities for sense enjoyment. We should mark the difference between m\u0101y\u0101 and sva-dh\u0101ma: for devotees the sva-dh\u0101ma acts, whereas in the case of nondevotees the m\u0101y\u0101 energy acts."

        "translation": "O my master, Lord Brahm\u0101 is fully surrendered unto You. In the beginning You gave him knowledge, and thus he could see and understand the entire universe, just as a person awakens from sleep and visualizes his immediate duties. You are the only shelter of all persons who desire liberation, and You are the friend of all who are distressed. How, therefore, can a learned person who has perfect knowledge ever forget You?",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be forgotten even for a moment by His surrendered devotees. The devotee understands that the Lord\u2019s causeless mercy is beyond his estimation; he cannot know how much he is benefited by the grace of the Lord. The more a devotee engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord, the more encouragement is supplied by the energy of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that to those who are constantly engaged in devotional service with love and affection, the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives intelligence from within and thus they may make further progress. Being so encouraged, the devotee can never forget, at any moment, the Personality of Godhead. He always feels obliged to Him for having achieved increased power in devotional service by His grace. Saintly persons like Sanaka, San\u0101tana and Lord Brahm\u0101 were able to see the entire universe, by the mercy of the Lord, through knowledge of the Lord. The example is given that a person may apparently abstain from sleep all day, but as long as he is not spiritually enlightened he is actually sleeping. He may sleep at night and perform his duties in the daytime, but as long as he does not come to the platform of working in spiritual enlightenment he is considered to be always sleeping. A devotee, therefore, never forgets the benefit derived from the Lord. The Lord is addressed here as \u0101rta-bandhu, which means \u201cfriend of the distressed.\u201d As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, after many, many births of executing severe austerities in search of knowledge, one comes to the point of real knowledge and becomes wise when one surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosopher, who does not surrender unto the Supreme Person, is understood to be lacking in real knowledge. The devotee in perfect knowledge cannot forget his obligation to the Lord at any moment."

        "translation": "My Lord, the transcendental bliss derived from meditating upon Your lotus feet or hearing about Your glories from pure devotees is so unlimited that it is far beyond the stage of brahm\u0101nanda, wherein one thinks himself merged in the impersonal Brahman as one with the Supreme. Since brahm\u0101nanda is also defeated by the transcendental bliss derived from devotional service, then what to speak of the temporary blissfulness of elevating oneself to the heavenly planets, which is ended by the separating sword of time? Although one may be elevated to the heavenly planets, he falls down in due course of time.",
        "purport": " The transcendental bliss derived from devotional service, primarily from \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam, hearing and chanting, cannot be compared to the happiness derived by karm\u012bs by elevating themselves to the heavenly planets or by j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs or yog\u012bs, who enjoy oneness with the supreme impersonal Brahman. Yog\u012bs generally meditate upon the transcendental form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but devotees not only meditate upon Him but actually engage in the direct service of the Lord. In the previous verse we find the phrase bhav\u0101pyaya, which refers to birth and death. The Lord can give relief from the chain of birth and death. It is a misunderstanding to think, as do the monists, that when one gets relief from the process of birth and death he merges into the Supreme Brahman. Here it is clearly said that the transcendental bliss derived from \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam by pure devotees cannot be compared to brahm\u0101nanda, or the impersonal conception of transcendental bliss derived by merging into the Absolute. The position of karm\u012bs is still more degraded. Their aim is to elevate themselves to the higher planetary systems. It is said, y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n: persons who worship the demigods are elevated to the heavenly planets (Bg. 9.25). But elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.21) we find, k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti: those who are elevated to the higher planetary systems must come down again as soon as the results of their pious activities are exhausted. They are like the modern astronauts who go to the moon; as soon as their fuel is used up, they are obliged to come back down to this earth. As the modern astronauts who go to the moon or other heavenly planets by force of jet propulsion have to come down again after exhausting their fuel, so also do those who are elevated to the heavenly planets by force of yaj\u00f1as and pious activities. Antak\u0101si-lulit\u0101t: by the sword of time one is cut from his exalted position within this material world, and he comes down again. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja appreciated that the results of devotional service are far more valuable than merging into the Absolute or being elevated to the heavenly planets. The words patat\u0101\u1e41 vim\u0101n\u0101t are very significant. Vim\u0101na means \u201cairplane.\u201d Those who are elevated to the heavenly planets are like airplanes, which drop when they run out of fuel."

Anyone who is trying to be aloof from this Krishna Consciousness Society and yet engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is living in a great hallucination, for this is not possible. From this statement by Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja it is clear that unless one is associated with devotees, his devotional service does not mature; it does not become distinct from material activities. The Lord says, sat\u0101\u1e41 prasa\u1e45g\u0101n mama v\u012brya-sa\u1e41vido bhavanti h\u1e5bt-kar\u1e47a-ras\u0101yan\u0101\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 3.25.25): only in the association of pure devotees can the words of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a be fully potent and relishable to the heart and ear. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja explicitly wanted the association of devotees. That association in devotional activities is just like the waves of an incessantly flowing river. In our Krishna Consciousness Society we have full engagement twenty-four hours a day. Every moment of our time is always busily engaged in the service of the Lord. This is called the incessant flow of devotional service. A M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosopher may question us, \u201cYou may be very happy in the association of devotees, but what is your plan for crossing the ocean of material existence?\u201d Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s answer is that it is not very difficult. He clearly says that this ocean can be crossed very easily if one simply becomes mad to hear the glories of the Lord. Bhavad-gu\u1e47a-kath\u0101: for anyone who persistently engages in hearing the topics of the Lord from \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta and who is actually addicted to this process, just as one becomes addicted to intoxicants, it is very easy to cross the nescience of material existence. The ocean of material nescience is compared to a blazing fire, but to a devotee this blazing fire is insignificant because he is completely absorbed in devotional service. Although the material world is blazing fire, to a devotee it appears full of pleasure (vi\u015bva\u1e41 p\u016br\u1e47a-sukh\u0101yate). The purport of this statement by Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is that devotional service in the association of devotees is the cause of the development of further devotional service. By devotional service only is one elevated to the transcendental planet Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and there also there is only devotional service, for the activities of devotional service both in this world and in the spiritual world are one and the same. Devotional service does not change. The example of a mango can be given here. If one gets an unripe mango, it is still a mango, and when it is ripe it remains the same mango, but it has become more tasteful and relishable. Similarly, there is devotional service performed according to the direction of the spiritual master and the injunctions and regulative principles of \u015b\u0101stra, and there is devotional service in the spiritual world, rendered directly in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But they are both the same. There is no change. The difference is that one stage is unripe and the other is ripe and more relishable. It is possible to mature in devotional service only in the association of devotees."

Indeed, he does not care for them.",

Yog\u012bs are generally not very much interested in devotional service; they want to regulate the breathing process. This is simply a bodily concern. Here Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja plainly says that a devotee has no more bodily interest. He knows that he is not the body. Therefore from the very beginning, without wasting time in bodily exercises, a devotee searches out a pure devotee and simply by his association becomes more advanced in spiritual consciousness than any yog\u012b. Because a devotee knows that he is not the body, he is never affected by bodily happiness or distress. He is not interested in bodily relationships with wife, children, home, bank balance, etc., or in the distress and happiness which come from these things. This is the special advantage of being a devotee. This status of life is possible only when a person is interested in associating with a pure devotee, who always enjoys the fragrance of the lotus feet of the Lord."

Now all kinds of methods of theorizing have come to an end.",
        "purport": " In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that He has spread Himself throughout the universe, but although everything is resting upon Him, He is aloof. The same concept is expressed here by Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. He states that before seeing the transcendental form of the Lord, he had experienced only the varieties of material forms, which are counted at 8,400,000 species of aquatics, birds, beasts, etc. The fact is that unless one engages in the devotional service of the Lord, it is impossible to understand the ultimate form of the Lord. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55). Bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti: factual understanding of the Absolute Truth, who is the Supreme Person, cannot be obtained by any process other than devotional service. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja here compares his previous state of understanding with the perfection of understanding in the presence of the Supreme Lord. The position of a living entity is to render service; unless he comes to the stage of appreciating the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he engages in the service of the various forms of trees, reptiles, animals, men, demigods, etc. One can experience that one man engages in the service of a dog, another serves plants and creepers, another the demigods, and another humanity, or his boss in the office \u2014 but no one is engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Aside from common men, even men who are elevated in terms of spiritual understanding are at the utmost engaged in the service of the vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa, or, unable to understand the ultimate form of the Lord, they worship voidism by meditation. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, had been blessed by the Supreme Lord. When the Lord touched His conchshell to Dhruva\u2019s forehead, real knowledge was revealed from within, and Dhruva could understand the Lord\u2019s transcendental form. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja here admits that not only was he ignorant, but by years he was only a child. It would not have been possible for an ignorant child to appreciate the supreme form of the Lord had he not been blessed by the Lord, who had touched His conchshell to Dhruva\u2019s forehead."

In the Vedas it is said, yasmin vij\u00f1\u0101te sarvam eva\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 bhavati: knowledge received through the transcendental, causeless mercy of the Lord is so perfect that by that knowledge the devotee becomes acquainted with all the different manifestations of the Lord. Lord K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u was present before Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who could also understand the Lord\u2019s two other forms, namely Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b (Mah\u0101) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Regarding Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it is stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.48): At the end of each and every millennium, when all the material worlds are dissolved, everything enters the body of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is lying on the lap of \u015ae\u1e63a N\u0101ga, another form of the Lord. Those who are not devotees cannot understand the different forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and their positions in regard to the creation. Sometimes the atheists argue, \u201cHow can a flower stem sprout from the navel of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u?\u201d They consider all the statements of the \u015b\u0101stras to be stories. As a result of their inexperience in the Absolute Truth and their reluctance to accept authority, they become more and more atheistic; they cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But a devotee like Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, by the grace of the Lord, knows all the manifestations of the Lord and their different positions. It is said that anyone who has even a little of the Lord\u2019s grace can understand His glories; others may go on speculating on the Absolute Truth, but they will always be unable to understand the Lord. In other words, unless one comes in contact with a devotee it is not possible to understand the transcendental form or the spiritual world and its transcendental activities."

        "translation": "My Lord, by Your unbroken transcendental glance You are the supreme witness of all stages of intellectual activities. You are eternally liberated, Your existence is situated in pure goodness, and You are existent in the Supersoul without change. You are the original Personality of Godhead, full with six opulences, and You are eternally the master of the three modes of material nature. Thus, You are always different from the ordinary living entities. As Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, You maintain all the affairs of the entire universe, and yet You stand aloof and are the enjoyer of the results of all sacrifices.",
        "purport": " An atheistic argument against the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead states that if God, the Supreme Person, appears and disappears and sleeps and awakens, then what is the difference between God and the living entity? Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is carefully distinguishing the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from that of the living entities. He points out the following differences. The Lord is eternally liberated. Whenever He appears, even within this material world, He is never entangled by the three modes of material nature. He is therefore known as try-adh\u012b\u015ba, the master of the three modes of material nature. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14) it is said, daiv\u012b hy e\u1e63\u0101 gu\u1e47amay\u012b mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101: the living entities are all entangled in the three modes of material nature. The external energy of the Lord is very strong, but the Lord, as the master of the three modes of material nature, is ever liberated from the action and reaction of those modes. He is therefore uncontaminated, as stated in the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad. The contamination of the material world does not affect the Supreme Godhead. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore says in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that those who are rascals and fools think of Him as an ordinary human being, not knowing His para\u1e41 bh\u0101vam. Para\u1e41 bh\u0101vam refers to His being always transcendentally situated. Material contamination cannot affect Him. Another difference between the Lord and the living entity is that a living entity is always in darkness. Even though he may be situated in the mode of goodness, there are still so many things which are unknown to him. But it is not the same for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He knows past, present and future and everything that is happening in everyone\u2019s heart. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms this (ved\u0101ha\u1e41 samat\u012bt\u0101ni). The Lord is not part of the soul \u2014 He is the unchangeable Supreme Soul, and the living entities are His parts and parcels. The living entity is forced to appear in this material world under the direction of daiva-m\u0101y\u0101, but when the Lord appears, He comes by His own internal potency, \u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101. Besides that, a living entity is within the time of past, present and future. His life has a beginning, a birth, and in the conditioned state his life ends with death. But the Lord is \u0101di-puru\u1e63a, the original person. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 Lord Brahm\u0101 offers his respect to the \u0101di-puru\u1e63a, Govinda, the original person, who has no beginning, whereas the creation of this material world has a beginning. The Ved\u0101nta says, janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25: everything is born from the Supreme, but the Supreme has no birth. He has all the six opulences in full and beyond comparison, He is the master of material nature, His intelligence is not broken under any circumstances, and He stands aloof, although He is the maintainer of the whole creation. As stated in the Vedas (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13), nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m. The Lord is the supreme maintainer. Living entities are meant to serve Him by offering sacrifices, for He is the rightful enjoyer of the results of all sacrifices. Therefore everyone should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord with his life, his riches, his intelligence and his words. This is the original, constitutional position of the living entities. One should never compare the sleeping of an ordinary living entity to the sleeping of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Causal Ocean. There is no stage at which the living entity can compare to the Supreme Person. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, being unable to adjust to all this, come to the conclusion of impersonalism or voidism."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, in Your impersonal manifestation of Brahman there are always two opposing elements \u2014 knowledge and ignorance. Your multi-energies are continually manifest, but the impersonal Brahman, which is undivided, original, changeless, unlimited and blissful, is the cause of the material manifestation. Because You are the same impersonal Brahman, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",
        "purport": " In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said that the unlimited impersonal Brahman is the effulgence of the transcendental body of Govinda. In that unlimited effulgent aura of the Supreme Personality of Godhead there are innumerable universes with innumerable planets of different categories. Although the Supreme Person is the original cause of all causes, His impersonal effulgence, known as Brahman, is the immediate cause of the material manifestation. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore offered his respectful obeisances unto the impersonal feature of the Lord. One who realizes this impersonal feature can enjoy the unchangeable brahm\u0101nanda, described here as spiritual bliss. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura describes that this impersonal feature, or Brahman manifestation, of the Supreme Lord is meant for persons who are essentially very advanced but still not able to understand the personal features or variegatedness of the spiritual world. Such devotees are known as j\u00f1\u0101na-mi\u015bra-bhaktas, or devotees whose devotional service is mixed with empiric knowledge. Because the impersonal Brahman realization is a partial understanding of the Absolute Truth, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja offers his respectful obeisances. It is said that this impersonal Brahman is the distant realization of the Absolute Truth. Although apparently Brahman seems to be devoid of energy, factually it has different energies working under the headings of knowledge and ignorance. On account of these different energies, there is continually a manifestation of vidy\u0101 and avidy\u0101. Vidy\u0101 and avidy\u0101 are very nicely described in \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad. It is said there that sometimes, due to avidy\u0101, or a poor fund of knowledge, one accepts the Absolute Truth as ultimately impersonal. But in fact the impersonal and personal realizations develop in proportion to the development of devotional service. The more we develop our devotional service, the more closely we approach the Absolute Truth, which, in the beginning, when we realize the Absolute Truth from a distant place, is manifest as impersonal. People in general, who are under the influence of avidy\u0101-\u015bakti, or m\u0101y\u0101, have neither knowledge nor devotion. But when a person who is a little advanced and is therefore called a j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b advances even more, he is in the category of a j\u00f1\u0101na-mi\u015bra-bhakta, or a devotee whose love is mixed with empiric knowledge. When he is still further advanced, he can realize that the Absolute Truth is a person with multi-energies. An advanced devotee can understand the Lord and His creative energy. As soon as one accepts the creative energy of the Absolute Truth, the six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are also understood. Devotees who are still further advanced, in full knowledge, can understand the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Only on that platform can one fully enjoy transcendental bliss. An example is given in this connection by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura of a person proceeding towards a destination. As he approaches, he sees the destination from a distant place, just as we see a city from a distance. At that time he simply understands that the city is situated at a distance. When he comes still nearer, however, he sees the domes and flags. But as soon as he enters the city, he sees various paths, gardens, lakes, marketplaces with shops, and persons buying. He sees varieties of cinema houses, and he sees dancing and jubilation. When a person actually enters the city and personally sees the activities of the city, he becomes satisfied."

        "purport": " Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was cognizant of the defective nature of his own devotional service. Pure devotional service is without material form and is not covered by mental speculation or fruitive activities. Pure devotional service is therefore called ahaituk\u012b, unmotivated. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja knew that he had come to worship the Lord in devotional service with a motive \u2014 to get the kingdom of his father. Such an adulterated devotee can never see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He therefore felt very grateful for the causeless mercy of the Lord. The Lord is so merciful that not only does He fulfill the desires of a devotee who is driven by ignorance and desires for material benefit, but He also gives such a devotee all protection, just as a cow gives milk to a newly born calf. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that the Lord gives intelligence to the constantly engaged devotee so that he may gradually approach the Lord without difficulty. A devotee must be very sincere in his devotional service; then, although there may be many things wrong on the devotee\u2019s part, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will guide him and gradually elevate him to the highest position of devotional service. The Lord is addressed herein by Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja as puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-m\u016brti, the ultimate goal of life. Generally puru\u1e63\u0101rtha is taken to mean execution of a type of religious principle or worship of God in order to get material benediction. Prayers for material benediction are intended for satisfying the senses. And when one is frustrated and cannot fully satisfy the senses in spite of all endeavor, he desires liberation, or freedom from material existence. These activities are generally called puru\u1e63\u0101rtha. But actually the ultimate goal is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called pa\u00f1cama-puru\u1e63\u0101rtha, the ultimate goal of life. Lord Caitanya therefore taught us not to ask from the Supreme Personality any benediction such as material wealth, popularity or a good wife. One should simply pray to the Lord to be constantly engaged in His transcendental loving service. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, being cognizant of his desire for material benefit, wanted protection from the Lord so that he might not be misled or deviated from the path of devotional service by material desires."

        "purport": " The Lord is so merciful to His devotee that He immediately said to Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u201cLet there be all good fortune for you.\u201d The fact is that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was very much afraid in his mind, for he had aspired after material benefit in discharging his devotional service and this was hampering him from reaching the stage of love of God. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.44) it is said, bhogai\u015bvarya-prasakt\u0101n\u0101m: those who are addicted to material pleasure cannot be attracted to devotional service. It was true that at heart Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted a kingdom that would be far better than Brahmaloka. This was a natural desire for a k\u1e63atriya. He was also only five years old, and in his childish way he desired to have a kingdom far greater than his father\u2019s, grandfather\u2019s or great-grandfather\u2019s. His father, Utt\u0101nap\u0101da, was the son of Manu, and Manu was the son of Lord Brahm\u0101. Dhruva wanted to excel all these great family members. The Lord knew Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s childish ambition, but how was it possible to offer Dhruva a position more exalted than Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s? The Lord assured Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that Dhruva would not be bereft of the Lord\u2019s love. He encouraged Dhruva not to be worried that he childishly had material desires and at the same time had the pure aspiration to be a great devotee. Generally, the Lord does not award a pure devotee material opulence, even though he may desire it. But Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s case was different. The Lord knew that he was such a great devotee that in spite of having material opulence he would never be deviated from love of God. This example illustrates that a highly qualified devotee can have the facility of material enjoyment and at the same time execute love of God. This, however, was a special case for Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja."

No one has ever ruled this planet, which is surrounded by all the solar systems, planets and stars. All the luminaries in the sky circumambulate this planet, just as bulls tread around a central pole for the purpose of crushing grains. Keeping the polestar to their right, all the stars inhabited by the great sages like Dharma, Agni, Ka\u015byapa and \u015aukra circumambulate this planet, which continues to exist even after the dissolution of all others.",
        "purport": " Although the polestar existed before its occupation by Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, it had no predominating deity. Dhruvaloka, our polestar, is the center for all other stars and solar systems, for all of them circle around Dhruvaloka just as a bull crushes grains by walking around and around a central pole. Dhruva wanted the best of all planets, and although it was a childish prayer, the Lord satisfied his demand. A small child may demand something from his father which his father has never given to anyone else, yet out of affection the father offers it to the child; similarly, this unique planet, Dhruvaloka, was offered to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva. The specific significance of this planet is that until the entire universe is annihilated this planet will remain, even during the devastation which takes place during the night of Lord Brahm\u0101. There are two kinds of dissolutions: one during the night of Lord Brahm\u0101 and one at the end of Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s life. At the end of Brahm\u0101\u2019s life, selected personalities go back home, back to Godhead. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is one of them. The Lord assured Dhruva that he would exist beyond the partial dissolution of this universe. Thus at the end of the complete dissolution, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja would go directly to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, to a spiritual planet in the spiritual sky. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments in this connection that Dhruvaloka is one of the lokas like \u015avetadv\u012bpa, Mathur\u0101 and Dv\u0101rak\u0101. They are all eternal places in the kingdom of Godhead, which is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (tad dh\u0101ma paramam) and in the Vedas (o\u1e41 tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 pada\u1e41 sad\u0101 pa\u015byanti s\u016braya\u1e25). The words parast\u0101t kalpa-v\u0101sin\u0101m, \u201ctranscendental to the planets inhabited after the dissolution,\u201d refer to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. In other words, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s promotion to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas was guaranteed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Your stepmother, Suruci, being maddened upon the death of her son, will go to search him out in the forest, but she will be devoured by a forest fire.",
        "purport": " Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja came to the forest to search out the Supreme Personality of Godhead with a revenging spirit against his stepmother. His stepmother had insulted Dhruva, who was not an ordinary person, but a great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. An offense at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is the greatest offense in this world. Because of having insulted Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Suruci would become mad upon the death of her son and would enter a forest fire, and thus her life would be ended. This was specifically mentioned by the Lord to Dhruva because he was determined for revenge against her. From this we should take the lesson that we should never try to insult a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Not only should we not insult a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, but we should not insult anyone unnecessarily. When Suruci insulted Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, he was just a child. She of course did not know that Dhruva was a great recognized Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, and so her offense was committed unknowingly. When one serves a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava unknowingly, one still gets the good result, and if one unknowingly insults a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, one suffers the bad result. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is especially favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pleasing him or displeasing him directly affects the pleasure and displeasure of the Supreme Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, in his eight stanzas of prayer to the spiritual master, has sung, yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101da\u1e25: by pleasing the spiritual master, who is a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, one pleases the Personality of Godhead, but if one displeases the spiritual master one does not know where he is going."

Ante n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-sm\u1e5bti\u1e25: the result of whatever we do in executing spiritual activities is successful if we can remember N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This program of constant remembrance can be disturbed by many things, but Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s life would be so pure, as assured by the Lord Himself, that Dhruva would never forget Him. Thus at the time of his death he would remember the Supreme Lord, and before his death he would enjoy this material world, not by sense gratification, but by performing great sacrifices. As stated in the Vedas, when one performs great sacrifices he must give charity, not only to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but also to the k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras. It is assured here that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja would be able to perform such activities. In this Age of Kali, however, the great sacrifice is the performance of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is designed to teach people (and to learn ourselves) the exact instruction of the Personality of Godhead. In this way we shall continuously perform the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a and continuously chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. Then at the end of our lives we shall certainly be able to remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and our program of life will be successful. In this age, distribution of pras\u0101da has replaced distribution of money. No one has sufficient money to distribute, but if we distribute k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101da as far as possible, this is more valuable than the distribution of money."

A paramaha\u1e41sa accepts only the active principle of everything. Just as a swan accepts only the milk from a mixture of water and milk, a paramaha\u1e41sa accepts only the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his life and soul, neglecting all external, material things. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was in this category, and due to his determination he achieved the result he desired, but still, when he returned home he was not very pleased."

        "translation": "Maitreya answered: Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s heart, which was pierced by the arrows of the harsh words of his stepmother, was greatly aggrieved, and thus when he fixed upon his goal of life he did not forget her misbehavior. He did not demand actual liberation from this material world, but at the end of his devotional service, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared before him, he was simply ashamed of the material demands he had in his mind.",
        "purport": " This important verse has been discussed by many stalwart commentators. Why was Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja not very pleased, even after achieving the goal of life he desired? A pure devotee is always free from any kind of material desires. In the material world, one\u2019s material desires are all most demonic; one thinks of others as one\u2019s enemies, one thinks of revenge against one\u2019s enemies, one aspires to become the topmost leader or topmost person in this material world, and thus one competes with all others. This has been described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Sixteenth Chapter, as asuric. A pure devotee has no demand from the Lord. His only concern is to serve the Lord sincerely and seriously, and he is not at all concerned about what will happen in the future. In the Mukunda-m\u0101l\u0101-stotra, King Kula\u015bekhara, author of the book, states in his prayer: \u201cMy dear Lord, I don\u2019t want any position of sense gratification within this material world. I simply want to engage in Your service perpetually.\u201d Similarly, Lord Caitanya, in His \u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka, also prayed, \u201cMy Lord, I do not want any amount of material wealth, I do not want any number of materialistic followers, nor do I want any attractive wife to enjoy. The only thing I want is that I may engage life after life in Your service.\u201d Lord Caitanya did not pray even for mukti, or liberation. In this verse Maitreya replied to Vidura that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, influenced by a revengeful attitude towards his insulting stepmother, did not think of mukti, nor did he know what mukti was. Therefore he failed to aim for mukti as his goal in life. But a pure devotee also does not want liberation. He is a soul completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord, and he does not demand anything from the Lord. This position was realized by Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja when he saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead present personally before him because he was elevated to the vasudeva platform. The vasudeva platform refers to the stage at which material contamination is conspicuous by absence only, or in other words where there is no question of the material modes of nature \u2014 goodness, passion and ignorance \u2014 and one can therefore see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because on the vasudeva platform one can see God face to face, the Lord is also called V\u0101sudeva. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s demand was for a position so exalted that it was never enjoyed even by Lord Brahm\u0101, his great-grandfather. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is so affectionate and kind towards His devotee, especially to a devotee like Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who went to render devotional service in the forest alone at the age of only five years, that although the motive might be impure, the Lord does not consider the motive; He is concerned with the service. But if a devotee has a particular motive, the Lord directly or indirectly knows it, and therefore He does not leave the devotee\u2019s material desires unfulfilled. These are some of the special favors by the Lord to a devotee. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was offered Dhruvaloka, a planet that was never resided upon by any conditioned soul. Even Brahm\u0101, although the topmost living creature within this universe, was not allowed to enter the Dhruvaloka. Whenever there is a crisis within this universe, the demigods go to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and they stand on the beach of the Milk Ocean. So the fulfillment of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s demand \u2014 a position more exalted than that of even his great-grandfather, Brahm\u0101 \u2014 was offered to him. Here in this verse the Lord is described as mukti-pati, which means \u201cone under whose lotus feet there are all kinds of mukti.\u201d There are five kinds of mukti \u2014 s\u0101yujya, s\u0101r\u016bpya, s\u0101lokya, s\u0101m\u012bpya and s\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6di. Out of these five muktis, which can be achieved by any person engaged in devotional service to the Lord, the one which is known as s\u0101yujya is generally demanded by M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers; they demand to become one with the impersonal Brahman effulgence of the Lord. In the opinion of many scholars, this s\u0101yujya-mukti, although counted among the five kinds of mukti, is not actually mukti because from s\u0101yujya-mukti one may again fall down to this material world. This information we have from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.2.32), wherein it is said, patanty adha\u1e25, which means \u201cthey again fall down.\u201d The monist philosopher, after executing severe austerity, merges into the impersonal effulgence of the Lord, but the living entity always wants reciprocation in loving affairs. Therefore, although the monist philosopher is elevated to the status of being one with the effulgence of the Lord, because there is no facility for associating with the Lord and rendering service unto Him, he again falls into this material world, and his service propensity is satisfied by materialistic welfare activities like humanitarianism, altruism and philanthropy. There are many instances of such falldowns, even for great sanny\u0101s\u012bs in the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da school. Therefore Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophers do not accept s\u0101yujya-mukti to be within the category of mukti. According to them, mukti means transferal to the loving service of the Lord from one\u2019s position of serving m\u0101y\u0101. Lord Caitanya also says in this connection that the constitutional position of a living entity is to render service to the Lord. That is real mukti. When one is situated in his original position, giving up artificial positions, he is called mukta, or liberated. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this is confirmed: anyone who engages in rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord is considered to be mukta, or brahma-bh\u016bta. It is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that a devotee is considered to be on the brahma-bh\u016bta platform when he has no material contamination. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a this is also confirmed: mukti means engagement in the service of the Lord. The great sage Maitreya explained that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not desire in the beginning to engage in the service of the Lord, but he wanted an exalted position better than his great-grandfather\u2019s. This is more or less not service to the Lord but service to the senses. Even if one gets the position of Brahm\u0101, the most exalted position in this material world, he is a conditioned soul. \u015ar\u012bla Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b says that if one is elevated to real, pure devotional service, he considers even great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and Indra to be on an equal level with an insignificant insect. The reason is that an insignificant insect has a desire for sense gratification, and even a great personality like Lord Brahm\u0101 also wants to dominate this material nature. Sense gratification means domination over material nature. The whole competition between conditioned souls is based upon domination of this material nature. Modern scientists are proud of their knowledge because they are discovering new methods to dominate the laws of material nature. They think that this is the advancement of human civilization \u2014 the more they can dominate the material laws, the more advanced they are. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s propensity in the beginning was like that. He wanted to dominate this material world in a greater position than Lord Brahm\u0101. Therefore elsewhere it is described that after the appearance of the Lord, when Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja thought and compared his determination to his final reward, he realized that he had wanted a few particles of broken glass but instead had received many diamonds. As soon as he saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, he immediately became conscious of the unimportance of his demand from the Lord to have an exalted position better than Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s. When Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja became situated on the vasudeva platform due to seeing the Lord face to face, all his material contamination was cleared. Thus he became ashamed of what his demands were and what he had achieved. He was very much ashamed to think that although he had gone to Madhuvana, giving up the kingdom of his father, and he had gotten a spiritual master like N\u0101rada Muni, he was still thinking of revenge against his stepmother and wanted to occupy an exalted post within this material world. These were the causes for his moroseness even after he received all the desired benedictions from the Lord. When Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja factually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there was no question of a revengeful attitude towards his stepmother nor any aspiration to lord it over the material world, but the Supreme Personality is so kind that He knew that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted these. Speaking before Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, He used the word ved\u0101ham because when Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja demanded material benefits, the Lord was present within his heart and so knew everything. The Lord always knows everything a man is thinking. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also: ved\u0101ha\u1e41 samat\u012bt\u0101ni. The Lord fulfilled all Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s desires. His revengeful attitude towards his stepmother and stepbrother was satisfied, his desire for a more exalted position than that of his great-grandfather was also fulfilled, and at the same time, his eternal position in Dhruvaloka was fixed. Although Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s achievement of an eternal planet was not conceived of by him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thought, \u201cWhat will Dhruva do with an exalted position within this material world?\u201d Therefore He gave Dhruva the opportunity to rule this material world for thirty-six thousand years with unchangeable senses and the chance to perform many great sacrifices and thus become the most reputed king within this material world. And, after finishing with all this material enjoyment, Dhruva would be promoted to the spiritual world, which includes the Dhruvaloka."

        "translation": "Alas, just look at me! I am so unfortunate. I approached the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can immediately cut the chain of the repetition of birth and death, but still, out of my foolishness, I prayed for things which are perishable.",
        "purport": " The word an\u0101tmyam is very significant in this verse. \u0100tm\u0101 means \u201cthe soul,\u201d and an\u0101tmya means \u201cwithout any conception of the soul.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva instructed his sons that unless a human being comes to the point of understanding the \u0101tm\u0101, or spiritual position, whatever he does is ignorance, and this brings only defeat in his life. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja regrets his unfortunate position, for although he approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always able to give His devotee the highest benediction of cessation of the repetition of birth and death, which is impossible for any demigod to offer, he foolishly wanted something perishable. When Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu asked immortality from Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord Brahm\u0101 expressed his inability to offer such a benediction because he himself is not immortal; therefore immortality, or complete cessation of the chain of repeated birth and death, can be offered by the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead Himself, not by others. Hari\u1e41 vin\u0101 na m\u1e5bti\u1e41 taranti. It is said that without the blessings of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no one can stop the continuous chain of birth and death within this material world. Therefore the Supreme Lord is also called bhava-cchit. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy in the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness prohibits the devotee from all kinds of material aspirations. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotee should always be any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya, free from all material aspirations for the results of fruitive activities or empiric philosophical speculation. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was actually initiated by N\u0101rada Muni, the greatest Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, in the chanting of o\u1e41 namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya. This mantra is a vi\u1e63\u1e47u-mantra, for by practicing the chanting of this mantra one is elevated to the Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja regrets that although he was initiated in the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-mantra by a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he still aspired for material benefits. That was another cause for lamentation. Although he got the result of the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-mantra by the causeless mercy of the Lord, he lamented how foolish he was to have strived for material benefits while practicing devotional service. In other words, every one of us who is engaged in devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be completely free from all material aspirations. Otherwise we will have to lament like Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja."

        "purport": " As shown by many instances in the Vedic literature, when a person undergoes severe austerities, the demigods become very much perturbed because they are always afraid of losing their posts as the predominating deities of the heavenly planets. It is known to them that their position in the higher planetary system is impermanent, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Ninth Chapter (k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti). It is said in the G\u012bt\u0101 that after exhausting the results of their pious activities, all the demigods, who are inhabitants of the higher planetary system, have to come back again to this earth. It is a fact that the demigods control the different activities of the limbs of our bodies. Factually we are not free even in moving our eyelids. Everything is controlled by them. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s conclusion is that these demigods, being envious of his superior position in devotional service, conspired against him to pollute his intelligence, and thus although he was the disciple of a great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, N\u0101rada Muni, he could not accept N\u0101rada\u2019s valid instructions. Now Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja regretted very much that he had neglected these instructions. N\u0101rada Muni had asked him, \u201cWhy should you bother about insult or adoration from your stepmother?\u201d He of course said to Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that since Dhruva was only a child, what did he have to do with such insult or adoration? But Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was determined to achieve the benediction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore N\u0101rada advised him to go back home for the time being, and in mature time he could try to practice devotional service. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja regretted that he had rejected the advice of N\u0101rada Muni and was adamant in asking him for something perishable, namely revenge against his stepmother for her insult, and possession of the kingdom of his father. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja regretted very much that he could not take seriously the instruction of his spiritual master and that his consciousness was therefore contaminated. Still, the Lord is so merciful that due to Dhruva\u2019s execution of devotional service He offered Dhruva the ultimate Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava goal."

        "purport": " Real knowledge is revealed to a devotee only when he comes to the right conclusion about life by the grace of the Lord. Our creation of friends and enemies within this material world is something like dreaming at night. In dreams we create so many things out of various impressions in the subconscious mind, but all such creations are simply temporary and unreal. In the same way, although apparently we are awake in material life, because we have no information of the soul and the Supersoul, we create many friends and enemies simply out of imagination. \u015ar\u012bla K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that within this material world or material consciousness, good and bad are the same. The distinction between good and bad is simply a mental concoction. The actual fact is that all living entities are sons of God, or by-products of His marginal energy. Because of our being contaminated by the modes of material nature, we distinguish one spiritual spark from another. That is also another kind of dreaming. It is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that those who are actually learned do not make any distinction between a learned scholar, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, an elephant, a dog and a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la. They do not see in terms of the external body; rather, they see the person as spirit soul. By higher understanding one can know that the material body is nothing but a combination of the five material elements. In that sense also the bodily construction of a human being and that of a demigod are one and the same. From the spiritual point of view we are all spiritual sparks, parts and parcels of the Supreme Spirit, God. Either materially or spiritually we are basically one, but we make friends and enemies as dictated by the illusory energy. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore said, daiv\u012b\u1e41 m\u0101y\u0101m up\u0101\u015britya: the cause of his bewilderment was his association with the illusory material energy."

Complete independence means situation in one\u2019s own constitutional position. The real independence of a living entity, who is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is to remain always dependent on the Supreme Lord, just like a child who plays in complete independence, guided by his parents, who watch over him. The independence of the conditioned soul does not mean to fight with the obstacles offered by m\u0101y\u0101, but to surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the material world, everyone is trying to become completely independent simply by fighting against the obstacles offered by m\u0101y\u0101. This is called the struggle for existence. Real independence is to be reinstated in the service of the Lord. Anyone who goes to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana planet is freely offering his service to the Lord. That is complete independence. Just contrary to this is material overlordship, which we wrongly take to be independence. Many great political leaders have tried to establish independence, but due to such so-called independence the people\u2019s dependence has only increased. The living entity cannot be happy trying to be independent in the material world. One has to surrender, therefore, unto the lotus feet of the Lord and engage in his original, eternal service. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja regrets that he wanted material opulence and greater prosperity than that of his great-grandfather, Lord Brahm\u0101. His begging from the Lord was like a poor man\u2019s asking a great emperor for a few grains of broken rice. The conclusion is that anyone who is engaged in the loving service of the Lord should never ask for material prosperity from the Lord. The awarding of material prosperity simply depends on the stringent rules and regulations of the external energy. Pure devotees ask the Lord only for the privilege of serving Him. This is our real independence. If we want anything else, it is a sign of our misfortune."

        "translation": "The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, persons like you, who are pure devotees of the lotus feet of Mukunda [the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can offer liberation] and who are always attached to the honey of His lotus feet, are always satisfied in serving at the lotus feet of the Lord. In any condition of life, such persons remain satisfied, and thus they never ask the Lord for material prosperity.",
        "purport": " In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that He is the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor of everything and anything within this creation, and the supreme friend of everyone. When one knows these things perfectly, he is always satisfied. The pure devotee never hankers after any kind of material prosperity. The karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs, however, endeavor always for their own personal happiness. Karm\u012bs work day and night to improve their economic condition, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs undergo severe austerities in order to get liberation, and yog\u012bs also undergo severe austerities by practicing the yoga system for attainment of wonderful mystic powers. A devotee, however, is not interested in such activities; he does not want mystic powers or liberation or material prosperity. He is satisfied in any condition of life, as long as he is constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. The Lord\u2019s feet are compared to the lotus, wherein there is saffron dust. A devotee is always engaged in drinking the honey from the lotus feet of the Lord. Unless one is freed from all material desires, he cannot actually taste the honey from the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. One has to discharge his devotional duties without being disturbed by the coming and going of material circumstances. This desirelessness for material prosperity is called ni\u1e63k\u0101ma. One should not mistakenly think that ni\u1e63k\u0101ma means giving up all desires. That is impossible. A living entity is eternally existent, and he cannot give up desires. A living entity must have desires; that is the symptom of life. When there is a recommendation to become desireless, it is to be understood that this means that we should not desire anything for our sense gratification. For a devotee this state of mind, ni\u1e25sp\u1e5bha, is the right position. Actually every one of us already has an arrangement for our standard of material comforts. A devotee should always remain satisfied with the standard of comforts offered by the Lord, as stated in the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad (tena tyaktena bhu\u00f1j\u012bth\u0101\u1e25). This saves time for executing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Feelings of insult or honor in this material world are never perceived by a devotee. Lord Caitanya therefore says that one has to be humbler than the grass and, He recommends, more tolerant than the tree to execute devotional service. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, therefore, has in this verse been described as saj-jan\u0101gra\u1e47\u012b\u1e25, the foremost of noble men.

        "purport": " When Deities are installed, They are washed with milk, yogurt and water, and this ceremony is called abhi\u1e63eka. In this verse it has been especially mentioned that the tears which flowed down from the eyes of Sun\u012bti were all-auspicious. This auspiciousness of the abhi\u1e63eka ceremony performed by his beloved mother was an indication that in the very near future Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja would be installed on the throne of his father. The history of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s leaving home was that his father refused to give him a place on his lap, and Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja determined that unless he got the throne of his father he would not come back. Now this abhi\u1e63eka ceremony performed by his beloved mother was an indication that he would occupy the throne of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Utt\u0101nap\u0101da. It is also significant in this verse that Sun\u012bti, mother of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, is described as v\u012bra-s\u016b, a mother who produced a great hero. There are many heroes in the world, but there is no comparison to Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who was not only a heroic emperor of this planet, but also a great devotee. A devotee is also a great hero because he conquers the influence of m\u0101y\u0101. When Lord Caitanya inquired from R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya about the most famous man in this world, the latter replied that anyone who is known as a great devotee of the Lord is to be accepted as the most famous."

In other words, the Lord was worshiped by both the mother and the son, and both were able to achieve the supreme benediction from the Supreme Lord. The word sudurjayam, an adjective which indicates that no one can conquer death, is very significant. When Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was away from his home, his father thought that he was dead. Ordinarily a king\u2019s son only five years old and away from home in the forest would certainly be supposed dead, but by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not only was he saved, but he was blessed with the highest perfection."

It also appears that all the domes of the city palaces as well as the pinnacles of the airplanes were decorated with ornamental work in gold, and, being reflected by the sunshine, they were all glittering. We can observe a specific distinction between Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s time and modern days, for the airplanes in those days were made of gold, whereas at the present moment airplanes are made of base aluminum.

Since it is described that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva ruled for thirty-six thousand years, he must have lived in the Satya-yuga, when people lived for one hundred thousand years. The life durations in the four yugas are also mentioned in the Vedic literature. In the Satya-yuga people used to live for one hundred thousand years, in the Tret\u0101-yuga people lived for ten thousand years, in Dv\u0101para-yuga they lived for one thousand years, and in this age, Kali-yuga, people may live up to one hundred years. With the progressive advance of each new yuga, the duration of human life is reduced by ninety percent \u2014 from one hundred thousand to ten thousand, from ten thousand to one thousand, and from one thousand to one hundred. It is said that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the great-grandson of Lord Brahm\u0101. This indicates that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s time was in the Satya-yuga in the beginning of creation. During one day of Lord Brahm\u0101, as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, there are many Satya-yugas. According to the Vedic calculation, at the present moment the twenty-eighth millennium is current. It can be calculated that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja lived many millions of years ago, but the description of the palace of Dhruva\u2019s father is so glorious that we cannot accept that advanced human civilization did not exist even forty or fifty thousand years ago. There were walls like those in the palace of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Utt\u0101nap\u0101da even very recently, during the Mogul period. Anyone who has seen the Red Fort in Delhi must have marked that the walls are made of marble and were once decorated with jewels. During the British period all these jewels were taken away and dispatched to the British Museum. The conception of worldly opulence was formerly based mainly on natural resources such as jewels, marble, silk, ivory, gold and silver. The advancement of economic development was not based on big motorcars. Advancement of human civilization depends not on industrial enterprises, but on possession of natural wealth and natural food, which is all supplied by the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that we may save time for self-realization and success in the human form of body. Another aspect of this verse is that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s father, Utt\u0101nap\u0101da, would very soon give up attachment for his palaces and would go to the forest for self-realization. From the description of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, therefore, we can make a very thorough comparative study of modern civilization and the civilization of mankind in the other millenniums \u2014 Satya-yuga, Tret\u0101-yuga and Dv\u0101para-yuga."

        "purport": " In this verse the word amara-drumai\u1e25, \u201cwith trees brought from the heavenly planets,\u201d is very significant. The heavenly planets are known as Amaraloka, the planets where death is very much delayed, because the people there live for ten thousand years according to the calculations of the demigods, in which our six months are equal to one day. The demigods live in the heavenly planets for months, years and ten-thousands of years according to demigod time, and then again, after the results of their pious activities are exhausted, they fall down to this earth. These are the statements that can be collected from Vedic literature. As the people there live for ten thousand years, so also do the trees. Of course, here on this earth there are many trees which live for ten thousand years, so what to speak of the trees on the heavenly planets? They must live for more than many ten-thousands of years, and sometimes, as practiced even now, some valuable trees are taken from one place to another. It is elsewhere stated that when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to the heavenly planets with His wife Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 He took a p\u0101rij\u0101ta flower tree from heaven and brought it to the earth. There was a fight between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the demigods due to the p\u0101rij\u0101ta tree\u2019s being taken from heaven to this planet. The p\u0101rij\u0101ta was planted in the palace of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a which was occupied by Queen Satyabh\u0101m\u0101. The flower and fruit trees in the heavenly planets are superior, for they are very pleasant and tasteful, and it appears that in the palace of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Utt\u0101nap\u0101da there were many varieties of such trees."

Modern politicians are not as great as kings like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Utt\u0101nap\u0101da, but because they get some political power for some days, they become so much attached to their positions that they never retire unless they are removed from their posts by cruel death or killed by some opposing political party. It is within our experience that the politicians in India do not quit their positions until death. This was not the practice in olden days, as it is evident from the behavior of King Utt\u0101nap\u0101da. Immediately after installing his worthy son Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja on the throne, he left his home and palace. There are hundreds and thousands of instances like this in which kings, in their mature age, would give up their kingdoms and go to the forest to practice austerity. Practice of austerity is the main business of human life. As Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva practiced austerity in his early age, his father, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Utt\u0101nap\u0101da, in his old age also practiced austerity in the forest. In modern days, however, it is not possible to give up one\u2019s home and go to the forest to practice austerity, but if people of all ages would take shelter of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement and practice the simple austerities of no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling and no meat-eating, and chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra regularly (sixteen rounds), by this practical method it would be a very easy task to get salvation from this material world."
