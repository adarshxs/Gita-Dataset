Separating their arms, legs, heads and bellies from their bodies, he delivered the Yak\u1e63as to the planetary system which is situated above the sun globe and which is attainable only by first-class brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, who have never discharged their semen.",
        "purport": " To be killed by the Lord or by His devotees is auspicious for nondevotees. The Yak\u1e63as were killed indiscriminately by Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, but they attained the planetary system attainable only for brahmac\u0101r\u012bs who never discharged their semen. As the impersonalist j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs or the demons killed by the Lord attain Brahmaloka, or Satyaloka, persons killed by a devotee of the Lord also attain Satyaloka. To reach the Satyaloka planetary system described here, one has to be elevated above the sun globe. Killing, therefore, is not always bad. If the killing is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee or in great sacrifices, it is for the benefit of the entity killed in that way. Material so-called nonviolence is very insignificant in comparison to killing done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotees. Even when a king or the state government kills a person who is a murderer, that killing is for the benefit of the murderer, for thus he may become cleared of all sinful reactions. An important word in this verse is \u016brdhva-retasa\u1e25, which means brahmac\u0101r\u012bs who have never discharged semen. Celibacy is so important that even though one does not undergo any austerities, penances or ritualistic ceremonies prescribed in the Vedas, if one simply keeps himself a pure brahmac\u0101r\u012b, not discharging his semen, the result is that after death he goes to the Satyaloka. Generally, sex life is the cause of all miseries in the material world. In the Vedic civilization sex life is restricted in various ways. Out of the whole population of the social structure, only the g\u1e5bhasthas are allowed restricted sex life. All others refrain from sex. The people of this age especially do not know the value of not discharging semen. As such, they are variously entangled with material qualities and suffer an existence of struggle only. The word \u016brdhva-retasa\u1e25 especially indicates the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, who undergo strict principles of austerity. But in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.16) the Lord says that even if one goes up to Brahmaloka, he again comes back (\u0101brahma-bhuvan\u0101l lok\u0101\u1e25 punar \u0101vartino\u00a0\u2019rjuna). Therefore actual mukti, or liberation, can be attained only by devotional service, because by devotional service one can go above Brahmaloka, or to the spiritual world, wherefrom he never comes back. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs are very proud of becoming liberated, but actual liberation is not possible unless one is in touch with the Supreme Lord in devotional service. It is said, hari\u1e41 vin\u0101 na m\u1e5bti\u1e41 taranti: without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy, no one can have liberation."

From this we can understand that killing is not bad, but when killing is done unnecessarily or when an offenseless person is killed, such killing opens the path to hell. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was saved from such sinful action because he was a great devotee. A k\u1e63atriya is allowed to kill only for maintenance of the law and order of the state; he is not allowed to kill or commit violence without reason. Violence is certainly a path leading to a hellish condition of life, but it is also required for maintenance of the law and order of the state. Here Lord Manu prohibited Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja from killing the Yak\u1e63as because only one of them was punishable for killing his brother, Uttama; not all of the Yak\u1e63a citizens were punishable. We find in modern warfare, however, that attacks are made upon innocent citizens who are without fault. According to the law of Manu, such warfare is a most sinful activity. Furthermore, at the present moment civilized nations are unnecessarily maintaining many slaughterhouses for killing innocent animals. When a nation is attacked by its enemies, the wholesale slaughter of the citizens should be taken as a reaction to their own sinful activities. That is nature\u2019s law."

But even though Dhruva could have argued that as a k\u1e63atriya it was his duty to fight with the enemy, he was informed that since every living entity is a residence of the Supreme Lord and can be considered a temple of the Lord, the unnecessary killing of any living entity is not permitted."

In the second stage the devotee is cognizant of his relationship with the Lord, his relationship with fellow devotees, his relationship with persons who are innocent and his relationship with persons who are envious. Sometimes devotees are ill-treated by envious persons. It is advised that an advanced devotee should be tolerant; he should show complete mercy to persons who are ignorant or innocent. A preacher-devotee is meant to show mercy to innocent persons, whom he can elevate to devotional service. Everyone, by constitutional position, is an eternal servant of God. Therefore, a devotee\u2019s business is to awaken everyone\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is his mercy. As for a devotee\u2019s treatment of other devotees who are his equals, he should maintain friendship with them. His general view should be to see every living entity as part of the Supreme Lord. Different living entities appear in different forms of dress, but according to the instruction of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, a learned person sees all living entities equally. Such treatment by the devotee is very much appreciated by the Supreme Lord. It is therefore said that a saintly person is always tolerant and merciful, he is a friend to everyone, never an enemy to anyone, and he is peaceful.

The word samprasanne, which is used in this verse, means \u201cbeing satisfied.\u201d A person should act in such a way that the Lord is satisfied by the activity; it is not that he himself is to be satisfied. Of course, when the Lord is satisfied, the devotee automatically becomes satisfied. This is the secret of the process of bhakti-yoga. Outside of bhakti-yoga, everyone is trying to satisfy himself. No one is trying to satisfy the Lord. Karm\u012bs grossly try to satisfy their senses, but even those who are elevated to the platform of knowledge also try to satisfy themselves, in a subtle form. Karm\u012bs try to satisfy themselves by sense gratification, and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs try to satisfy themselves by subtle activities or mental speculation and thinking themselves to be God. Yog\u012bs also try to satisfy themselves, by thinking that they can achieve different mystic perfections. But only devotees try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotees\u2019 process of self-realization is completely different from the processes of the karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs. Everyone else is trying to satisfy himself, whereas the devotee tries only to satisfy the Lord. The devotional process is completely different from the others; by working to please the Lord by engaging his senses in the Lord\u2019s loving service, the devotee is immediately situated on the transcendental platform, and he enjoys unlimited blissful life."

In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is also confirmed, prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni: everything is created, maintained and annihilated by the material modes of nature.

It is by such powerful potencies that the universe is created, although grossly it appears to be no more than the five elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air and ether. Similarly, the bodies of all species of living entities, whether human beings, demigods, animals or birds, are also created by the same five elements, and by sexual union they expand into more and more living entities. That is the way of creation, maintenance and annihilation. One should not be disturbed by the waves of material nature in this process. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was indirectly advised not to be afflicted by the death of his brother because our relationship with the body is completely material.

When a child is born, the parents immediately see to its maintenance. This tendency for maintenance of offspring is present not only in human society, but in animal society as well. Even tigers care for their cubs, although their propensity is to eat other animals. By the interaction of the material modes of nature, creation, maintenance and also annihilation take place inevitably. But at the same time we should know that all is conducted under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everything is going on under that process. Creation is the action of the rajo-gu\u1e47a, the mode of passion; maintenance is the action of sattva-gu\u1e47a, the mode of goodness; and annihilation is the action of tamo-gu\u1e47a, the mode of ignorance. We can see that those who are situated in the mode of goodness live longer than those who are situated in the tamo-gu\u1e47a or rajo-gu\u1e47a. In other words, if one is elevated to the mode of goodness, he is elevated to a higher planetary system, where the duration of life is very great. \u016ardhva\u1e41 gacchanti sattva-sth\u0101\u1e25: great \u1e5b\u1e63is, sages and sanny\u0101s\u012bs who maintain themselves in sattva-gu\u1e47a, or the mode of material goodness, are elevated to a higher planetary system.

        "translation": "My dear Dhruva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is uncontaminated by the material modes of nature. He is the remote cause of the creation of this material cosmic manifestation. When He gives the impetus, many other causes and effects are produced, and thus the whole universe moves, just as iron moves by the integrated force of a magnet.",
        "purport": " How the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead works within this material world is explained in this verse. Everything is happening by the energy of the Supreme Lord. The atheistic philosophers, who do not agree to accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the original cause of creation, think that the material world moves by the action and reaction of different material elements. A simple example of the interaction of elements occurs when we mix soda and acid and the movement of effervescence is produced. But one cannot produce life by such interaction of chemicals. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, with different wishes and different actions. How the material force is working cannot be explained just on the basis of chemical reaction. A suitable example in this connection is that of the potter and the potter\u2019s wheel. The potter\u2019s wheel rotates, and several varieties of earthen pots come out. There are many causes for the earthen pots, but the original cause is the potter, who sets a force on the wheel. That force comes by his superintendence. The same idea is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: behind all material action and reaction there is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that everything depends on His energy and yet He is not everywhere. The pot is produced under certain conditions of action and reaction of material energy, but the potter is not in the pot. In a similar way, the material creation is set up by the Lord, but He remains aloof. As stated in the Vedas, He simply glanced over it and the agitation of matter immediately began. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is also said that the Lord impregnates the material energy with the part-and-parcel j\u012bvas, and thus the different forms and different activities immediately ensue. Because of the different desires and karmic activities of the j\u012bva soul, different types of bodies in different species are produced. In Darwin\u2019s theory there is no acceptance of the living entity as spirit soul, and therefore his explanation of evolution is incomplete. Varieties of phenomena occur within this universe on account of the actions and reactions of the three material modes, but the original creator, or the cause, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is mentioned here as nimitta-m\u0101tram, the remote cause. He simply pushes the wheel with His energy. According to the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, the Supreme Brahman has transformed Himself into many varieties of forms, but that is not the fact. He is always transcendental to the actions and reactions of the material gu\u1e47as, although He is the cause of all causes. Lord Brahm\u0101 therefore says in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.1): There are many causes and effects, but the original cause is \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

It appears that He is acting, but He is not the actor. He is killing, but He is not the killer. Thus it is understood that only by His inconceivable power is everything happening.",
        "purport": " The word durvibh\u0101vy\u0101 means \u201cinconceivable by our tiny brain,\u201d and vibhakta-v\u012brya\u1e25 means \u201cdivided in varieties of potencies.\u201d This is the right explanation of the display of creative energies in the material world. We can better understand the mercy of God by an example: a government state is always supposed to be merciful, but sometimes, in order to keep law and order, the government employs its police force, and thus punishment is meted out to the rebellious citizens. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always merciful and full of transcendental qualities, but certain individual souls have forgotten their relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and have endeavored to lord it over material nature. As a result of their endeavor, they are involved in varieties of material interaction. It is incorrect to argue, however, that because energy issues from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is the actor. In the previous verse, the word nimitta-m\u0101tram indicates that the Supreme Lord is completely aloof from the action and reaction of this material world. How is everything being done? The word \u201cinconceivable\u201d has been used. It is not within the power of one\u2019s small brain to comprehend; unless one accepts the inconceivable power and energy of the Lord, one cannot make any progress. The forces which act are certainly set up by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He is always aloof from their action and reaction. The varieties of energies produced by the interaction of material nature produce the varieties of species of life and their resultant happiness and unhappiness. How the Lord acts is nicely explained in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a: fire is situated in one place, while the heat and light produced by the fire act in many different ways. Another example given is that the electric powerhouse is situated in one place, but by its energies many different types of machinery move. The production is never identical with the original source of the energy, but the original source of energy, being the prime factor, is simultaneously one with and different from the product. Therefore Lord Caitanya\u2019s philosophy, acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva, is the perfect way of understanding. In this material world, the Lord incarnates in three forms \u2014 as Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u015aiva \u2014 by which He takes charge of the three modes of material nature. By His incarnation of Brahm\u0101 He creates, as the incarnation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u He maintains, and by His incarnation of \u015aiva, He also annihilates. But the original source of Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u015aiva \u2014 Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2014 is always apart from these actions and reactions of material nature."

He has no beginning, although He is the beginning of everything, nor is He ever exhaustible, although everything is exhausted in due course of time. The living entities are created through the agency of the father and killed through the agency of death, but He is perpetually free of birth and death.",
        "purport": " The supreme authority and inconceivable power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be minutely studied from this verse. He is always unlimited. That means that He has no creation or end. He is, however, death (in the form of time), as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cI am death. I take away everything at the end of life.\u201d Eternal time is also without beginning, but it is the creator of all creatures. The example is given of touchstone, which creates many valuable stones and jewels but does not decrease in power. Similarly, creation occurs many times, everything is maintained, and, after a time, everything is annihilated \u2014 but the original creator, the Supreme Lord, remains untouched and undiminished in power. The secondary creation is made by Brahm\u0101, but Brahm\u0101 is created by the Supreme Godhead. Lord \u015aiva annihilates the whole creation, but at the end he is also annihilated by Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u remains. In the Vedic hymns it is stated that in the beginning there is only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and that He alone remains at the end. An example can help us to understand the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Lord. In the recent history of warfare the Supreme Personality of Godhead created a Hitler and, before that, a Napoleon Bonaparte, and they each killed many living entities in war. But in the end Bonaparte and Hitler were also killed. People are still very much interested in writing and reading books about Hitler and Bonaparte and how they killed so many people in war. Year after year many books are published for public reading regarding Hitler\u2019s killing thousands of Jews in confinement. But no one is researching who killed Hitler and who created such a gigantic killer of human beings. The devotees of the Lord are not much interested in the study of the flickering history of the world. They are interested only in Him who is the original creator, maintainer and annihilator. That is the purpose of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement."

But in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 we find it said, karm\u0101\u1e47i nirdahati: the Lord diminishes or vanquishes the reactions of devotees. The same fact is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra: one should perform karma only for the purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord; otherwise one is bound by the action and reaction of karma. Under the laws of karma a living entity wanders within the universe under the rule of eternal time, and sometimes he becomes a mosquito and sometimes Lord Brahm\u0101. To a sane man this business is not very fruitful. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25) gives a warning to the living entities: y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n \u2014 those who are addicted to the worship of the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, and those who are addicted to worship of the Pit\u0101s, forefathers, go to the Pit\u0101s. Those who are inclined to material activities remain in the material sphere. But persons who engage in devotional service reach the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, where there is neither birth nor death nor different varieties of life under the influence of the law of karma. The best interest of the living entity is to engage himself in devotional service and go back home, back to Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura advised: \u201cMy friend, you are being washed away in material nature\u2019s waves of time. Please try to understand that you are the eternal servant of the Lord. Then everything will stop, and you will be eternally happy.\u201d"

        "purport": " There are different types of philosophers \u2014 m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas, atheists, astronomers, sexualists and so many other classifications of mental speculators. The real conclusion is that it is our work only that binds us within this material world in different varieties of life. How these varieties have sprung up is explained in the Vedas: it is due to the desire of the living entity. The living entity is not a dead stone; he has different varieties of desire, or k\u0101ma. The Vedas say, k\u0101mo \u2019kar\u1e63\u012bt. The living entities are originally parts of the Lord, like sparks of a fire, but they have dropped to this material world, attracted by a desire to lord it over nature. That is a fact. Every living entity is trying to lord it over the material resources to the best of his ability. This k\u0101ma, or desire, cannot be annihilated. There are some philosophers who say that if one gives up his desires, he again becomes liberated. But it is not at all possible to give up desire, for desire is a symptom of the living entity. If there were no desire, then the living entity would be a dead stone. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, therefore, advises that one turn his desire towards serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then desire becomes purified. And when one\u2019s desires are purified, one becomes liberated from all material contamination. The conclusion is that the different philosophers\u2019 theories to explain the varieties of life and their pleasure and pain are all imperfect. The real explanation is that we are eternal servants of God and that as soon as we forget this relationship we are thrown into the material world, where we create our different activities and suffer or enjoy the result. We are drawn into this material world by desire, but the same desire must be purified and employed in the devotional service of the Lord. Then our disease of wandering in the universe under different forms and conditions will end."

        "translation": "The Absolute Truth, Transcendence, is never subject to the understanding of imperfect sensory endeavor, nor is He subject to direct experience. He is the master of varieties of energies, like the full material energy, and no one can understand His plans or actions; therefore it should be concluded that although He is the original cause of all causes, no one can know Him by mental speculation.",
        "purport": " The question may be raised, \u201cSince there are so many varieties of philosophers theorizing in different ways, which of them is correct?\u201d The answer is that the Absolute Truth, Transcendence, is never subject to direct experience or mental speculation. The mental speculator may be called Dr. Frog. The story is that a frog in a three-foot well wanted to calculate the length and breadth of the Atlantic Ocean on the basis of his knowledge of his own well. But it was an impossible task for Dr. Frog. A person may be a great academician, scholar or professor, but he cannot speculate and expect to understand the Absolute Truth, for his senses are limited. The cause of all causes, the Absolute Truth, can be known from the Absolute Truth Himself, and not by our ascending process to reach Him. When the sun is not visible at night or when it is covered by a cloud in the day, it is not possible to uncover it, either by bodily or mental strength or by scientific instruments, although the sun is there in the sky. No one can say that he has discovered a torchlight so powerful that if one goes on a roof and focuses the torchlight on the night sky, the sun will then be seen. There is no such torchlight, nor is it possible. The word avyakta, \u201cunmanifested,\u201d in this verse indicates that the Absolute Truth cannot be manifested by any strain of so-called scientific advancement of knowledge. Transcendence is not the subject matter of direct experience. The Absolute Truth may be known in the same way as the sun covered by a cloud or covered by night, for when the sun rises in the morning, in its own way, then everyone can see the sun, everyone can see the world, and everyone can see himself. This understanding of self-realization is called \u0101tma-tattva. Unless, however, one comes to this point of understanding \u0101tma-tattva, one remains in the darkness in which he was born. Under the circumstances, no one can understand the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is equipped with varieties of energies, as stated in the Vedic literature (par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate). He is equipped with the energy of eternal time. Not only does He have the material energy which we see and experience, but He has also many reserve energies that He can manifest in due course of time when necessary. The material scientist can simply study the partial understanding of the varieties of energies; he can take up one of the energies and try to understand it with limited knowledge, but still it is not possible to understand the Absolute Truth in full by dint of material science. No material scientist can foretell what is going to happen in the future. The bhakti-yoga process, however, is completely different from so-called scientific advancement of knowledge. A devotee completely surrenders unto the Supreme, who reveals Himself by His causeless mercy. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, dad\u0101mi buddhi-yoga\u1e41 tam. The Lord says, \u201cI give him intelligence.\u201d What is that intelligence? Yena m\u0101m upay\u0101nti te. The Lord gives one the intelligence to cross over the ocean of nescience and come back home, back to Godhead. In conclusion, the cause of all causes, the Absolute Truth, or Supreme Brahman, cannot be understood by philosophical speculation, but He reveals Himself to His devotee because the devotee fully surrenders unto His lotus feet. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is therefore to be accepted as a revealed scripture spoken by the Absolute Truth Himself when He descended to this planet. If any intelligent man wants to know what God is, he should study this transcendental literature under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. Then it is very easy to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is."

Sometimes he gets the body of a demigod, and he thinks that body to be his identity. Similarly, when he gets the body of a dog he identifies his self with that body. But for the Supreme Personality of Godhead there is no such distinction between the body and the soul. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, therefore, certifies that anyone who thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary human being is without knowledge of His transcendental nature and is a great fool. The Lord says, na m\u0101\u1e41 karm\u0101\u1e47i limpanti: He is not affected by anything He does, because He is never contaminated by the material modes of nature. That we have a material body proves that we are infected by the three material modes of nature. The Lord says to Arjuna, \u201cYou and I had many, many births previously, but I remember everything, whereas you do not.\u201d That is the difference between the living entity, or conditioned soul, and the Supreme Soul. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has no material body, and because He has no material body, He is not affected by any work He executes. There are many M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers who consider that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is the effect of a concentration of the material mode of goodness, and they distinguish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s soul from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body. The real situation, however, is that the body of the conditioned soul, even if he has a large accumulation of material goodness, is material, whereas K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is never material; it is transcendental. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no false ego, for He does not identify Himself with the false and temporary body. His body is always eternal; He descends to this world in His own original, spiritual body. This is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as para\u1e41 bh\u0101vam. The words para\u1e41 bh\u0101va\u1e41 and divyam are especially significant in understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personality."

Everyone, including the demigods headed by Lord Brahm\u0101, is working under His control, just as a bull, prompted by a rope in its nose, is controlled by its owner.",
        "purport": " The material disease is to declare independence from the supreme controller. Factually, our material existence begins when we forget the supreme controller and wish to lord it over material nature. Everyone in the material world is trying his best to become the supreme controller \u2014 individually, nationally, socially and in many other ways. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was advised to stop fighting by his grandfather, who was concerned that Dhruva was adhering to a personal ambition to fight to annihilate the whole race of Yak\u1e63as. In this verse, therefore, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu seeks to eradicate the last tinge of false ambition in Dhruva by explaining the position of the supreme controller. The words m\u1e5btyum am\u1e5btam, \u201cdeath and immortality,\u201d are significant. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, \u201cI am ultimate death, who takes away everything from the demons.\u201d The demons\u2019 business is to continually struggle for existence as lords over material nature. The demons repeatedly meet death after death and create a network of involvement in the material world. The Lord is death for the demons, but for devotees He is am\u1e5bta, eternal life. Devotees who render continuous service to the Lord have already attained immortality, for whatever they are doing in this life they will continue to do in the next. They will simply change their material bodies for spiritual bodies. Unlike the demons, they no longer have to change material bodies. The Lord, therefore, is simultaneously death and immortality. He is death for demons and immortality for devotees. He is the ultimate goal of everyone because He is the cause of all causes. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was advised to surrender unto Him in all respects, without keeping any personal ambition. One may put forward the argument, \u201cWhy are the demigods worshiped?\u201d The answer is given here that demigods are worshiped by less intelligent men. The demigods themselves accept sacrifices for the ultimate satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " The living entities have three kinds of vision, according to their positions in self-realization. According to the bodily concept of life, one sees differentiation in terms of varieties of bodies. The living entity actually passes through many varieties of material forms, but despite all such changes of body, he is eternal. When living entities, therefore, are viewed in the bodily concept of life, one appears to be different from another. Lord Manu wanted to change the vision of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who was looking upon the Yak\u1e63as as different from him or as his enemies. Factually no one is an enemy or a friend. Everyone is passing through different types of bodies under the law of karma, but as soon as one is situated in his spiritual identity, he does not see differentiation in terms of this law. In other words, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): A devotee, who is already liberated, does not see differentiation in terms of the outward body; he sees all living entities as spirit souls, eternal servants of the Lord. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was advised by Lord Manu to see with that vision. He was specifically advised to do so because he was a great devotee and should not have looked upon other living entities with ordinary vision. Indirectly Manu pointed out to Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that out of material affection Dhruva thought of his brother as his kin and the Yak\u1e63as as his enemies. Such observation of differentiation subsides as soon as one is situated in his original position as an eternal servant of the Lord."

        "purport": " Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a liberated soul, and actually he was not angry with anyone. But because he was the ruler, it was his duty to become angry for some time in order to keep law and order in the state. His brother, Uttama, was without fault, yet he was killed by one of the Yak\u1e63as. It was the duty of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to kill the offender (life for life) because Dhruva was the king. When the challenge came, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja fought vehemently and punished the Yak\u1e63as sufficiently. But anger is such that if one increases it, it increases unlimitedly. In order that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s kingly anger not exceed the limit, Manu was kind enough to check his grandson. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja could understand the purpose of his grandfather, and he immediately stopped the fighting. The words \u015brutena bh\u016byas\u0101, \u201cby constantly hearing,\u201d are very important in this verse. By constantly hearing about devotional service, one can check the force of anger, which is detrimental to the process of devotional service. \u015ar\u012bla Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said that the constant hearing of the pastimes of the Lord is the panacea for all material diseases. Everyone, therefore, should hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. By hearing one can always remain in equilibrium, and thus his progress in spiritual life will not be hampered. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s becoming angry with the miscreants was quite appropriate. There is a short story in this connection about a snake who became a devotee upon instruction by N\u0101rada, who instructed him not to bite anymore. Since ordinarily a snake\u2019s business is to fatally bite other living entities, as a devotee he was forbidden to do so. Unfortunately, people took advantage of this nonviolence on the part of the snake, especially the children, who began to throw stones at him. He did not bite anyone, however, because it was the instruction of his spiritual master. After a while, when the snake met his spiritual master, N\u0101rada, he complained, \u201cI have given up the bad habit of biting innocent living entities, but they are mistreating me by throwing stones at me.\u201d Upon hearing this, N\u0101rada Muni instructed him, \u201cDon\u2019t bite, but do not forget to expand your hood as if you were going to bite. Then they will go away.\u201d Similarly, a devotee is always nonviolent; he is qualified with all good characteristics. But, in the common world, when there is mischief made by others, he should not forget to become angry, at least for the time being, in order to drive away the miscreants."
