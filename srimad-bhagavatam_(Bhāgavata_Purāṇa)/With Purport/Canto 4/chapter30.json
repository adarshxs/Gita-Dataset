The living entity wanders within this material universe in so many species of life and so many planetary systems. The distress and happiness obtained during the span of life are called iha, and the distress and happiness obtained in the next life are called paratra. Actually, Lord Mah\u0101deva (\u015aiva) is one of the great demigods within this material world. Generally his blessings bestowed on ordinary people mean material happiness. The predominating deity of this material world, Durg\u0101, is under the control of Lord Mah\u0101deva, Giri\u015ba. Thus Lord Mah\u0101deva can offer anyone any kind of material happiness. Generally people prefer to become devotees of Lord Giri\u015ba to obtain material happiness, but the Pracet\u0101s met Lord Mah\u0101deva by providential arrangement. Lord Mah\u0101deva instructed them to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he personally offered a prayer. As stated in the previous verse (rudra-g\u012btena), simply by chanting the prayers offered by Lord \u015aiva to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Pracet\u0101s were transferred to the spiritual world. Sometimes devotees desire to enjoy material happiness also; therefore, by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the devotee is given a chance to enjoy the material world before his final entrance into the spiritual world. Sometimes a devotee is transferred to a heavenly planet \u2014 to Janaloka, Maharloka, Tapoloka, Siddhaloka and so on. However, a pure devotee never aspires for any kind of material happiness. The pure devotee is consequently transferred directly to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, which is described here as param. In this verse Vidura asks Maitreya, the disciple of B\u1e5bhaspati, about the different achievements of the Pracet\u0101s."

Here the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as pura\u00f1jana. According to Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, the living entity is called pura\u00f1jana because he has become an inhabitant of this material world, and under the influence of the three modes of material nature, he is forced to live within it. The Supreme Personality of Godhead creates this material world (pura), and He also enters within it. A\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham: the Lord enters within the heart of the living entity and within the atom. Therefore both the living entity and the Lord are called pura\u00f1jana. One pura\u00f1jana, the living entity, is subordinate to the supreme pura\u00f1jana; therefore the duty of the subordinate pura\u00f1jana is to satisfy the supreme pura\u00f1jana. That is devotional service. Lord Rudra, or Lord \u015aiva, is the original \u0101c\u0101rya of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava samprad\u0101ya called the Rudra samprad\u0101ya. Rudra-g\u012btena indicates that under the disciplic succession of Lord Rudra, the Pracet\u0101s achieved spiritual success."

Consequently, whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present, there cannot be darkness or ignorance. Actually this dark universe is illuminated by the sun, but the sun and moon simply reflect the bodily effulgence of the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.8) the Lord says, prabh\u0101smi \u015ba\u015bi-s\u016bryayo\u1e25: \u201cI am the illuminating energy of both the sun and the moon.\u201d The conclusion is that the origin of all life is the bodily effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: yasya prabh\u0101 prabhavato jagad-a\u1e47\u1e0da-ko\u1e6di. Being illuminated by the bodily effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything is freed from all darkness."

Each and every one of the sons of King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at was an individual soul, but they were united in offering transcendental service to the Lord. The unity of the individual souls attempting to satisfy the Supreme Lord or rendering service to the Lord is real unity. In the material world such unity is not possible. Even though people may officially unite, they all have different interests. In the United Nations, for instance, all the nations have their particular national ambitions, and consequently they cannot be united. Disunity between individual souls is so strong within this material world that even in a society of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, members sometimes appear disunited due to their having different opinions and leaning toward material things. Actually, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness there cannot be two opinions. There is only one goal: to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to one\u2019s best ability. If there is some disagreement over service, such disagreement is to be taken as spiritual. Those who are actually engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be disunited in any circumstance. This makes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very happy and willing to award all kinds of benediction to His devotees, as indicated in this verse. We can see that the Lord is immediately prepared to award all benedictions to the sons of King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at."

        "purport": " Good intelligence means going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracet\u0101s, the sons of King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is the way of the parampar\u0101 system. If we follow the \u0101c\u0101ryas, we attain the same benefit as our predecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference between hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like Arjuna, who formerly heard Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people argue that since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from Him. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and reading it, as long as one accepts Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is, spoken by the Lord. However, if one wants to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by his imperfect interpretations, one cannot possibly understand the mysteries of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, even though one may be a great scholar according to mundane estimation."

        "purport": " Whenever a great sage undergoes severe austerities for material power, the King of heaven, Indra, becomes very envious. All the demigods have responsible posts for the management of universal affairs and are very highly qualified with pious activities. Although they are ordinary living entities, they are able to attain responsible posts, like Lord Brahm\u0101, Indra, Candra and Varu\u1e47a. As is the nature of this material world, the King of heaven, Indra, is very anxious if a great sage undergoes severe austerities. The whole material world is filled with such envy that everyone becomes afraid of his neighbors. Every businessman is afraid of his associates because this material world is the field of activities for all kinds of envious people who have come here to compete with the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Indra was very much afraid of the severe austerities performed by the great sage Ka\u1e47\u1e0du, and he sent Pramloc\u0101 to break his vows and austerities. A similar incident took place in the case of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra. From other incidents in the \u015b\u0101stras, it appears that Indra has always been envious. When King P\u1e5bthu was celebrating various sacrifices, outdoing Indra, Indra became very envious, and he disturbed King P\u1e5bthu\u2019s sacrifice. This has already been discussed in previous chapters. King Indra became successful in breaking the vow of the great sage Ka\u1e47\u1e0du, who became attracted by the beauty of the heavenly society girl Pramloc\u0101 and begot a female child. This child is described herein as lotus-eyed and very beautiful. Being thus successful in her mission, Pramloc\u0101 returned to the heavenly planets, leaving the newborn child to the care of the trees. Fortunately, the trees accepted the child and agreed to raise her."

        "translation": "Those who are engaged in auspicious activities in devotional service certainly understand that the ultimate enjoyer or beneficiary of all activities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus when one acts, he offers the results to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and passes life always engaged in the topics of the Lord. Even though such a person may be participating in family life, he is not affected by the results of his actions.",
        "purport": " Generally a person living in a family becomes overly attached to fruitive activity. In other words, he tries to enjoy the results of his activities. A devotee, however, knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme enjoyer and the supreme proprietor (bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram). Consequently, the devotee does not consider himself the proprietor of any occupation. The devotee always thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the proprietor; therefore the results of his business are offered to the Supreme Lord. One who thus lives in the material world with his family and children never becomes affected by the contaminations of the material world. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9): One who tries to enjoy the results of his activities becomes bound by the results. One who offers the results or profits to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, does not become entangled in the results. This is the secret of success. Generally people take sanny\u0101sa to become free from the reactions of fruitive activity. One who does not receive the results of his actions but offers them instead to the Supreme Personality of Godhead certainly remains in a liberated condition. In Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu, \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b confirms this: If one engages himself in the service of the Lord through his life, wealth, words, intelligence and everything he possesses, he will always be liberated in any condition. Such a person is called a j\u012bvan-mukta, one who is liberated during this lifetime. Devoid of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, those who engage in material activities simply become more entangled in material bondage. They have to suffer and enjoy the actions and reactions of all activity. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore the greatest boon to humanity because it keeps one always engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. The devotees think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, act for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, eat for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, sleep for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus everything is engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A total life in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness saves one from material contamination. As stated by Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja: \u201cIf one is so expert that he can engage everything or dovetail everything in the service of the Lord, to give up the material world would be a great blunder.\u201d One should learn how to dovetail everything in the service of the Lord, for everything is connected to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the real purpose of life and secret of success. As reiterated later in the Third Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.19): \u201cTherefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty; for by working without attachment, one attains the Supreme.\u201d The Third Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 specifically considers material activities for the purpose of sense gratification and material activities for the purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord. The conclusion is that these are not one and the same. Material activities for sense gratification are the cause of material bondage, whereas the very same activities for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are the cause of liberation. How the same activity can be the cause of bondage and liberation can be explained as follows. One may get indigestion due to eating too many milk preparations \u2014 condensed milk, sweet rice, and so on. But even though there is indigestion or diarrhea, another milk preparation \u2014 yogurt mixed with black pepper and salt \u2014 will immediately cure these maladies. In other words, one milk preparation can cause indigestion and diarrhea, and another milk preparation can cure them."

If one is placed in material opulence due to the special mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he should not consider that opulence a cause for bondage. When a mature devotee is blessed with material opulence, he does not become affected adversely, for he knows how to employ material opulence in the service of the Lord. There are many such examples in the history of the world. There were kings like P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Janaka, Dhruva, Vaivasvata Manu and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku. All of these were great kings and were especially favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If a devotee is not mature, the Supreme Lord will take away all his opulence. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead states, yasy\u0101ham anug\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101mi hari\u1e63ye tad-dhana\u1e41 \u015banai\u1e25: \u201cMy first mercy shown to My devotee is to take away all his material opulence.\u201d Material opulence detrimental to devotional service is taken away by the Supreme Lord, whereas a person who is mature in devotional service is given all material facilities."

        "translation": "Always engaging in the activities of devotional service, devotees feel ever-increasingly fresh and new in all their activities. The all-knower, the Supersoul within the heart of the devotee, makes everything increasingly fresh. This is known as the Brahman position by the advocates of the Absolute Truth. In such a liberated stage [brahma-bh\u016bta], one is never bewildered. Nor does one lament or become unnecessarily jubilant. This is due to the brahma-bh\u016bta situation.",
        "purport": " A devotee is inspired by the Supersoul within the heart to advance in devotional service in a variety of ways. The devotee does not feel hackneyed or stereotyped, nor does he feel that he is in a stagnant position. In the material world, if one engages in chanting a material name, he will feel tired after chanting a few times. However, one can chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra all day and night and never feel tired. As chanting is increased, it will come out new and fresh. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b said that if he could somehow get millions of ears and tongues, then he could relish spiritual bliss by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. There is really nothing uninspiring for a highly advanced devotee. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that He is situated in everyone\u2019s heart and that He helps the living entity forget and remember. By the grace of the Lord, the devotee gets inspiration: \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d (Bg. 10.10) As stated (ku\u015bala-karma\u1e47\u0101m), those engaged in auspicious activities in devotional service are guided by the Supersoul, described in this verse as j\u00f1a, one who knows everything \u2014 past, present and future. The Supersoul gives instructions to the sincere, unalloyed devotee on how he can progress more and more in approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b in this connection says that the Supersoul, the plenary expansion of the Personality of Godhead, exists in everyone\u2019s heart, but in the heart of the devotee He reveals Himself as ever-increasingly new. Being inspired by Him, the devotee experiences increased transcendental bliss in the execution of his devotional service."

Everything is conclusively there in the Vedas. Therefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the process of the Vedas is perfect and conclusive. The Vedas state, ata\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101m\u0101di na bhaved gr\u0101hyam indriyai\u1e25: the transcendental names, forms, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of the Lord cannot be understood by our blunt material senses. Sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau svayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25: when a devotee engages his senses favorably in devotional service, the Lord, through His causeless mercy, reveals Himself to the devotee. This is the conclusive Vedic process. The Vedas also indicate that simply by chanting the holy names of the Lord one can without a doubt become spiritually advanced. We cannot approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the speed of mind or words, but if we stick to devotional service we can easily and quickly approach Him. In other words, the Supreme Lord is attracted by devotional service, and He can approach us more swiftly than we can approach Him with our mental speculation. The Lord has stated that although He is beyond the range of mental speculation and the speed of thought, He can be approached easily by His causeless mercy. Thus only by His causeless mercy can He be attained. Other methods will not be effective."

        "purport": " In the previous verse it has been said (g\u1e5bh\u012bta-m\u0101y\u0101-gu\u1e47a-vigrah\u0101ya) that the Lord accepts three kinds of bodies (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva) for the purposes of creating, maintaining and annihilating the cosmic manifestation. The three predominating deities of the material universe \u2014 Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u015aiva \u2014 are called gu\u1e47a-avat\u0101ras. There are many kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the first incarnations within this material world are Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Mahe\u015bvara (\u015aiva). Out of these three, Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva accept material bodies, but Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u does not accept a material body. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is therefore known as vi\u015buddha-sattva. His existence is completely free from the contamination of the material modes of nature. One should therefore not think that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is in the same category with Lord Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva. The \u015b\u0101stras forbid us to think in this way: One who considers Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to be in the same category with devas like Lord Brahm\u0101 or Lord \u015aiva or who thinks Lord Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva to be equal to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is to be considered as p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b, a faithless nonbeliever. Therefore in this verse Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is distinguished in the words namo vi\u015buddha-sattv\u0101ya. Although a living entity like us, Lord Brahm\u0101 is exalted due to his pious activities; therefore he is given the high post of Brahm\u0101. Lord \u015aiva is not actually like a living entity, but he is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His position is somewhere between Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Brahm\u0101, the living entity. Lord \u015aiva is therefore explained in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.45) in this way: Lord \u015aiva is considered to be like yogurt (dadhi). Yogurt is nothing but transformed milk; nonetheless, yogurt cannot be accepted as milk. Similarly, Lord \u015aiva holds almost all the powers of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and he is also above the qualities of the living entity, but he is not exactly like Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, just as yogurt, although transformed milk, is not exactly like milk. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is also described herein as v\u0101sudev\u0101ya k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ya. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions are His plenary portions or portions of His plenary portions (known as sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba and kal\u0101). The sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba, or direct expansion, is also called a\u1e41\u015ba. All vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattvas are sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba, direct parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as V\u0101sudeva because He appeared in this material world as the son of Vasudeva. Similarly, He is known as Devak\u012b-nandana, Ya\u015bod\u0101-nandana, Nanda-nandana and so on. Again and again the Lord is very much interested in increasing the influence of His devotees. Therefore He is described herein as prabhave sarva-s\u0101tvat\u0101m. The s\u0101tvata community is a community of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, pure devotees of the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has unlimited powers, and He wants to see that His devotees are also entrusted with unlimited powers. Therefore a devotee of the Lord is always distinguished from all other living entities. The word hari means \u201cone who takes away all miserable conditions,\u201d and hari-medhase means that the Lord is always planning ways to deliver the conditioned soul from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. The Lord is so kind that He personally incarnates to deliver the conditioned souls, and whenever He comes, He makes His plans: \u201cTo deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear millennium after millennium.\u201d (Bg. 4.8)"

The form of the Lord as worshiped in the temples is called arc\u0101-vigraha or arc\u0101vat\u0101ra, the worshipable form, the Deity incarnation. This facility is offered to neophyte devotees so that they can see the real form of the Lord face to face and offer their respectful obeisances and sacrifices in the form of arc\u0101. Through such facilities the neophytes gradually invoke their original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Deity worship in the form of temple worship is the most valuable benediction given by the Lord to beginners. All neophytes must therefore engage in the worship of the Lord by keeping the arc\u0101-vigraha (arc\u0101vat\u0101ra) at home or in the temple."

In this connection there is a story about a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who was offering sweet rice to the Lord within his mind. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a had no money nor any means of worshiping the Deity, but within his mind he arranged everything nicely. He had gold pots to bring water from the sacred rivers to wash the Deity, and he offered the Deity very sumptuous food, including sweet rice. Once, before he offered the sweet rice, he thought that it was too hot, and he thought, \u201cOh, let me test it. My, it is very hot.\u201d When he put his finger in the sweet rice to test it, his finger was burned and his meditation broken. Although he was offering food to the Lord within his mind, the Lord accepted it nonetheless. Consequently, the Lord in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha immediately sent a chariot to bring the br\u0101hma\u1e47a back home, back to Godhead. Thus it is the duty of every sincere devotee to accept the arc\u0101-vigraha at home or in the temple and worship the form of the Lord as advised in authorized scriptures and directed by the spiritual master."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His plenary expansion as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul, sits in everyone\u2019s heart and can understand the attitudes and desires of His devotees. The Lord also gives opportunity to the nondevotees to fulfill their desires, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca). Whatever a living entity desires, however insignificant he may be, is noted by the Lord, who gives him a chance to fulfill his desires. If the desires of the nondevotees are fulfilled, why not those of the devotee? A pure devotee simply wants to engage in the service of the Lord without material desire, and if he wants this within the core of his heart, where the Lord is situated, and if he is without ulterior motive, why should the Lord not understand? If a sincere devotee renders service to the Lord or to the arc\u0101-vigraha, the form of the Lord, all his activities prove successful because the Lord is present within his heart and understands his sincerity. Thus if a devotee, with all confidence, goes on discharging the prescribed duties of devotional service, he will ultimately attain success."

According to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.11), the Supreme Lord is the ultimate fact of the Absolute Truth. Brahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate: the Absolute Truth is realized in three features \u2014 impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagav\u0101n. The word apavarga means \u201cliberation.\u201d Pavarga means \u201cmaterial existence.\u201d In material existence, one always works very hard but is ultimately baffled. One then dies and has to accept another body to work very hard again. This is the cycle of material existence. Apavarga means just the opposite. Instead of working hard like cats and dogs, one returns home, back to Godhead. Liberation begins with merging into the Brahman effulgence of the Supreme Lord. This conception is held by the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b samprad\u0101ya, philosophical speculators, but realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is higher. When a devotee understands that the Lord is satisfied, liberation, or merging into the effulgence of the Lord, is not very difficult. One has to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the impersonal Brahman effulgence just as one has to approach the sun through the sunshine. It is not very difficult to merge into the impersonal effulgence of the Lord, Brahman, if one has satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

For a pure devotee, kaivalya, merging into the existence of Brahman, the Brahman effulgence, is no better than living in hell. Similarly, he considers promotion to heavenly planets (trida\u015ba-p\u016br) just another kind of phantasmagoria. In other words, a pure devotee does not place much value in the destination of the karm\u012bs (the heavenly planets) or in the destination of the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs (merging into the Brahman effulgence). A pure devotee considers a moment\u2019s association with another pure devotee to be far superior to residing in a heavenly planet or merging in the Brahman effulgence. The topmost benediction for those who are living in this material world and are subjected to the repetition of birth and death (transmigration) is association with pure devotees. One should search out such pure devotees and remain with them. That will make one completely happy, even though living within the material world. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is started for that purpose. A person who is overly affected materially may take advantage of this movement and become intimately associated with it.

As stated by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, sad\u0101 samudvigna-dhiy\u0101m asad-grah\u0101t: the living entities who have accepted this material world as a residence are full of anxiety.

As the Supreme Lord Himself confirms: \u201cMy dear N\u0101rada, actually I do not reside in My abode, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, nor do I reside within the hearts of the yog\u012bs, but I reside in that place where My pure devotees chant My holy name and discuss My form, pastimes and qualities.\u201d Because of the presence of the Lord in the form of the transcendental vibration, the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha atmosphere is evoked. This atmosphere is without fear and anxiety. One living entity does not fear another. By hearing the holy names and glories of the Lord, a person executes pious activities: \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.17). Thus his material hankerings immediately stop. This sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement started by the Society for Krishna Consciousness is meant for creating Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, the transcendental world that is without anxiety, even in this material world. The method is the propagation of the \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam process throughout the world. In the material world everyone is envious of his fellow man. Animalistic envy exists in human society as long as there is no performance of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, the chanting of the holy names: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The Pracet\u0101s therefore decided to remain always in the society of devotees, and they considered that to be the highest benediction possible in human life."

Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is the ultimate goal of sanny\u0101s\u012bs, those in the renounced order of life, and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is worshiped through this sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement by those who are liberated from material contamination. Indeed, they recite the holy name again and again.",
        "purport": " The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs are missing the real presence of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. This is because they falsely claim to be N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a Himself. According to the customary etiquette of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, they address one another as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. To say that everyone is a temple of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is correct, but to accept another human being as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is a great offense. The conception of daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (poor N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a), an attempt to identify the poor with N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, is also a great offense. Even to identify N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a with demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva is an offense: \u201cOne who considers Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a on a level with great demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva is immediately listed among nonbelievers.\u201d The fact is that by performing sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a one can immediately please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a Himself descends and immediately is present. In this Age of Kali, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is immediately present in the form of Lord Caitanya. Concerning Lord Caitanya, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.32) states: \u201cIn the Age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational chanting to worship the incarnation of Godhead who constantly sings the name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although His complexion is not blackish, He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. He is accompanied by His associates, servants, weapons and confidential companions.\u201d After all, human life is meant for pleasing N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and this can easily be done by performing sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. Whenever there is congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord, Gaura N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Lord Caitanya, immediately appears and is worshiped by sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. In this verse it is said that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is ny\u0101sin\u0101\u1e41 gati\u1e25, the ultimate goal of the sanny\u0101s\u012bs. The goal of those who have renounced the material world is the attainment of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012b therefore dedicates his life to serving N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; he does not falsely claim to be N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Instead of becoming nirvaira (nonenvious of other living entities), one who tries to become N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a becomes envious of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the attempt to become N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a constitutes the greatest offense. Actually, when one chants or discusses the transcendental activities of the Lord, he immediately becomes nonenvious. In this material world everyone is envious of everyone else, but by vibrating or discussing the holy name of the Lord, one becomes nonenvious and devoid of material hankering. Because of our envy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we have become envious of all other living entities. When we are no longer envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be real peace, unity and fraternity in human society. Without N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a or sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a there cannot be peace in this material world."

The go\u1e63\u1e6dhy\u0101nand\u012b is one who desires to increase the number of devotees all over the world. He travels all over the world just to purify the world and the people residing in it. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu advised: Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu wanted His followers to move all over the world to preach in every town and village. In the Caitanya samprad\u0101ya, those who strictly follow the principles of Lord Caitanya must travel all over the world to preach the message of Lord Caitanya, which is the same as preaching the words of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 \u2014 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The more the devotees preach the principles of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, the more people throughout the world will benefit. Devotees like the great sage N\u0101rada, who travel all over to preach, are called go\u1e63\u1e6dhy\u0101nand\u012b. N\u0101rada Muni is always wandering throughout the universe just to create different types of devotees. N\u0101rada even made a hunter a devotee. He also made Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Prahl\u0101da devotees. Actually, all devotees are indebted to the great sage N\u0101rada, for he has wandered both in heaven and in hell. A devotee of the Lord is not even afraid of hell. He goes to preach the glories of the Lord everywhere \u2014 even in hell \u2014 because there is no distinction between heaven and hell for a devotee: \u201cA pure devotee of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is never afraid of going anywhere and everywhere. For him heaven and hell are one and the same.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 6.17.28) Such devotees, wandering all over the world, deliver those who are actually afraid of this material existence. Some people are already disgusted with material existence, being confused and frustrated by material enjoyment, and some people, who are intelligent, are interested in understanding the Supreme Lord. Both may take advantage of the pure devotee who wanders throughout the world."

Many sinful men bathe in the holy waters of the places of pilgrimage. They take their baths in the waters of the Ganges and Yamun\u0101 at places such as Pray\u0101ga, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and Mathur\u0101. In this way the sinful men are purified, but their sinful actions and reactions remain at the holy places of pilgrimage. When a devotee comes to take his bath at those places of pilgrimage, the sinful reactions left by the sinful men are neutralized by the devotee. T\u012brth\u012b-kurvanti t\u012brth\u0101ni sv\u0101nta\u1e25-sthena gad\u0101-bh\u1e5bt\u0101 (Bh\u0101g. 1.13.10): because the devotee always carries the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, wherever he goes becomes a place of pilgrimage, a holy place for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is therefore the duty of everyone to associate with a pure devotee and thus attain freedom from material contamination. Everyone should take advantage of the wandering devotees, whose only business is to deliver conditioned souls from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101."

There is no harm in worshiping the demigods, provided that one\u2019s aim is to return home, back to Godhead. Generally people go to the demigods for material benefit, as indicated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20): \u201cThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.\u201d One enamored by material benefits is called h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101na, \u201cone who has lost his intelligence.\u201d In this connection it is to be noted that sometimes in revealed scriptures Lord \u015aiva is described as being nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The point is that Lord \u015aiva and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are so intimately connected that there is no difference in opinion. The actual fact is, ekale \u012b\u015bvara k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u0101ra saba bh\u1e5btya: \u201cThe only supreme master is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and all others are His devotees or servants.\u201d (Cc. \u0100di 5.142) This is the real fact, and there is no difference of opinion between Lord \u015aiva and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in this connection. Nowhere in revealed scripture does Lord \u015aiva claim to be equal to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This is simply the creation of the so-called devotees of Lord \u015aiva, who claim that Lord \u015aiva and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are one. This is strictly forbidden in the vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-tantra: yas tu n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e41 devam. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 are intimately connected as master and servants. \u015aiva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam: Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is honored and offered obeisances by Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. To consider that they are all equal is a great offense. They are all equal in the sense that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and all others are His eternal servants."

Vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: in understanding the Vedas, one has to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who has actually understood Him surrenders unto Him after many, many births. We find all these qualifications in the Pracet\u0101s. They underwent severe austerities and penances within the water, and they did not take any food for a very long time. They practiced these austerities not for material benediction but for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. One may engage in any business \u2014 material or spiritual \u2014 but the purpose should be the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This verse presents a perfect picture of Vedic civilization. People training to become devotees should be respectful not only to the Supreme Personality of Godhead but also to those who are elderly in knowledge, who are \u0100ryans and actual devotees of the Lord. An \u0100ryan is one who does not boast but is an actual devotee of the Lord. \u0100ryan means \u201cadvanced.\u201d Formerly, those who claimed to be \u0100ryans had to be devotees of the Lord. For instance, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.2) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a chastised Arjuna by saying that he was speaking like a non-\u0100ryan: \u201cThe Supreme Person [Bhagav\u0101n] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy.\u201d Arjuna, the k\u1e63atriya, was refusing to fight despite being directly ordered by the Supreme Lord. He was thus chastised by the Lord as belonging to a non-\u0100ryan family. Anyone who is advanced in the devotional service of the Lord certainly knows his duty. It does not matter whether his duty is violent or nonviolent. If it is sanctioned and ordered by the Supreme Lord, it must be performed. An \u0100ryan performs his duty. It is not that the \u0100ryans are unnecessarily inimical to living entities. The \u0100ryans never maintain slaughterhouses, and they are never enemies of poor animals. The Pracet\u0101s underwent severe austerities for many, many years, even within the water. Accepting austerities and penances is the avowed business of those interested in advanced civilization. The word nirandhas\u0101m means \u201cwithout food.\u201d Eating voraciously and unnecessarily is not the business of an \u0100ryan. Rather, the eating process should be restricted as far as possible. When \u0100ryans eat, they eat only prescribed eatables. Regarding this, the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26):"

According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, this is an exhibition of His kindness to innumerable other devotees. Although He was being attracted by the Pracet\u0101s, He left. This is an example of His renunciation. This renunciation was also exhibited by Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu when He stayed with Advaita Prabhu after taking sanny\u0101sa. All the devotees there wanted Him to stay a few days longer, but Lord Caitanya left without hesitation. The conclusion is that although the Supreme Lord has unlimited kindness for His devotees, He is not attached to anyone. He is equally kind to His innumerable devotees all over the creation."

Not only that, but because of his disrespecting Lord \u015aiva, he had to undergo the tribulation of taking birth from within the womb of a woman. In the Dak\u1e63a-yaj\u00f1a arena, he was once killed by Lord \u015aiva\u2019s servant, V\u012brabhadra. Because that was not sufficient, he again took birth, from the womb of M\u0101ri\u1e63\u0101. At the end of the Dak\u1e63a-yaj\u00f1a and the disastrous incidents there, Dak\u1e63a offered his prayer to Lord \u015aiva. Although he had to give up his body and take birth from the womb of a woman impregnated by the semen of a k\u1e63atriya, he received all opulence by the grace of Lord \u015aiva. These are the subtle laws of material nature. Unfortunately, people in this modern age do not know how these laws are working. Having no knowledge of the eternity of the spirit soul and its transmigration, the population of the present age is in the greatest ignorance. Because of this, it is said in Bh\u0101gavatam (1.1.10), mand\u0101\u1e25 sumanda-matayo manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101 hy upadrut\u0101\u1e25: the total population in this Age of Kali-yuga is very bad, lazy, unfortunate and disturbed by material conditions."

As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: The word jagad-a\u1e47\u1e0da-n\u0101tha means Lord Brahm\u0101. There are innumerable jagad-a\u1e47\u1e0da-n\u0101tha Brahm\u0101s, and thus we can calculate the many Manus. The present age is under the control of Vaivasvata Manu. Each Manu lives 4,320,000 years multiplied by 71. The present Manu has already lived for 4,320,000 years multiplied by 28. All these long life spans are ultimately ended by the laws of material nature. The controversy of the Dak\u1e63a-yaj\u00f1a took place in the Sv\u0101yambhuva manvantara period. As a result, Dak\u1e63a was punished by Lord \u015aiva, but by virtue of his prayers to Lord \u015aiva he became eligible to regain his former opulence. According to Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, Dak\u1e63a underwent severe penances up to the fifth manvantara. Thus at the beginning of the sixth manvantara, known as the C\u0101k\u1e63u\u1e63a manvantara, Dak\u1e63a regained his former opulence by the blessings of Lord \u015aiva."
