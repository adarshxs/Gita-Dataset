        "purport": " It appears that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja married after being installed on the throne of his father and after the departure of his father to the forest for self-realization. It is very important to note in this connection that since Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Utt\u0101nap\u0101da was greatly affectionate towards his son, and since it is the duty of a father to get his sons and daughters married as quickly as possible, why did he not get his son married before he left home? The answer is that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Utt\u0101nap\u0101da was a r\u0101jar\u1e63i, saintly king. Although he was busy in his political affairs and duties of government management, he was very anxious for self-realization. Therefore as soon as his son Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was quite worthy to take charge of the government, he took this opportunity to leave home, just like his son, who, without fear, left home for self-realization, even at the age of five years. These are rare instances from which we can see that the importance of spiritual realization is above all other important work. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Utt\u0101nap\u0101da knew very well that to get his son Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja married was not so important that it should take preference to his going away to the forest for self-realization."

        "purport": " In this verse the word m\u0101nava is very significant. Generally this word is used to mean \u201chuman being.\u201d Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is also described here as m\u0101nava. Not only is Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja a descendant of Manu, but all human society descends from Manu. According to Vedic civilization, Manu is the lawgiver. Even today Hindus in India follow the laws given by Manu. Therefore everyone in human society is a m\u0101nava, or descendant from Manu, but Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is a distinguished m\u0101nava because he is a great devotee. The denizens of the planet Siddhaloka, where the residents can fly in the sky without airplanes, were anxious over Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s welfare in the battlefield. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says, therefore, that not only is a devotee well protected by the Supreme Lord, but all the demigods, and even ordinary men, are anxious for his security and safety. The comparison given here that Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja appeared to merge in the ocean of the Yak\u1e63as is also significant. When the sun sets on the horizon, it appears that the sun drowns in the ocean, but factually the sun has no difficulty. Similarly, although Dhruva appeared to drown in the ocean of the Yak\u1e63as, he had no difficulty. As the sun rises again in due course at the end of night, so Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, although he might have been in difficulty (because, after all, it was a fight, and in any fighting activities there are reverses), that did not mean that he was defeated."

A devotee is always protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His inspiration only, the sages came to encourage Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and assure him that there was no danger because he was a soul fully surrendered to the Supreme Lord.

He never has to come back for repetition of birth and death. Simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can surpass the ocean of death, so Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was certainly able to surpass the illusory magical feats of the Yak\u1e63as, which for the time being disturbed his mind."
