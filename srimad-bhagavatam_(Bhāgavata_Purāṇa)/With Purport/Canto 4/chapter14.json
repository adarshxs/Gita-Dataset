All the great sages headed by Bh\u1e5bgu were always thinking of how to elevate all the people of the universe to the spiritual platform. Indeed, they advised the kings of every planet to rule the people with that ultimate goal of life in mind. The great sages used to advise the head of the state, or the king, and he used to rule the populace in accordance with their instruction. After the disappearance of King A\u1e45ga, there was no one to follow the instructions of the great sages. Consequently all the citizens became unruly, so much so that they could be compared to animals. As described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13), human society must be divided into four orders according to quality and work. In every society there must be an intelligent class, administrative class, productive class and worker class. In modern democracy these scientific divisions are turned topsy-turvy, and by vote \u015b\u016bdras, or workers, are chosen for administrative posts. Having no knowledge of the ultimate goal of life, such persons whimsically enact laws without knowledge of life\u2019s purpose. The result is that no one is happy."

It should be understood that sages, saintly persons and devotees are not unconcerned with the people\u2019s welfare. Ordinary karm\u012bs are busy acquiring money for sense gratification, and ordinary j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are socially aloof when they speculate on liberation, but actual devotees and saintly persons are always anxious to see how the people can be made happy both materially and spiritually. Therefore the great sages began to consult one another on how to get out of the dangerous atmosphere created by King Vena."

By taking their advice, he can become the greatest executive power, and everyone in his kingdom will be happy, peaceful and prosperous. The great kings were very responsible in taking the instructions given by great saintly personalities. The kings used to accept the instructions given by great sages like Par\u0101\u015bara, Vy\u0101sadeva, N\u0101rada, Devala and Asita. In other words, they would first accept the authority of saintly persons and then execute their monarchical power. Unfortunately, in the present Age of Kali, the head of government does not follow the instructions given by the saintly persons; therefore neither the citizens nor the men of government are very happy. Their duration of life is shortened, and almost everyone is wretched and bereft of bodily strength and spiritual power. If citizens want to be happy and prosperous in this democratic age, they should not elect rascals and fools who have no respect for saintly persons."

Thus a pious king can certainly enjoy himself in this world as well as in the life after death.",
        "purport": " The duty of a pious king is described very nicely in this verse. His first and foremost duty is to give protection to the citizens from thieves and rogues as well as from ministers who are no better than thieves and rogues. Formerly, ministers were appointed by the king and were not elected. Consequently, if the king was not very pious or strict, the ministers would become thieves and rogues and exploit the innocent citizens. It is the king\u2019s duty to see that there is no increase of thieves and rogues either in the government secretariat or in the departments of public affairs. If a king cannot give protection to citizens from thieves and rogues both in the government service and in public affairs, he has no right to exact taxes from them. In other words, the king or the government that taxes can levy taxes from the citizens only if the king or government is able to give protection to the citizens from thieves and rogues. In the Twelfth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.1.40) there is a description of these thieves and rogues in government service. As stated, praj\u0101s te bhak\u1e63ayi\u1e63yanti mlecch\u0101 r\u0101janya-r\u016bpi\u1e47a\u1e25: \u201cThese proud mlecchas [persons who are less than \u015b\u016bdras], representing themselves as kings, will tyrannize their subjects, and their subjects, on the other hand, will cultivate the most vicious practices. Thus practicing evil habits and behaving foolishly, the subjects will be like their rulers.\u201d The idea is that in the democratic days of Kali-yuga, the general population will fall down to the standard of \u015b\u016bdras. As stated (kalau \u015b\u016bdra-sambhava\u1e25), practically the whole population of the world will be \u015b\u016bdra. A \u015b\u016bdra is a fourth-class man who is only fit to work for the three higher social castes. Being fourth-class men, \u015b\u016bdras are not very intelligent. Since the population is fallen in these democratic days, they can only elect a person in their category, but a government cannot run very well when it is run by \u015b\u016bdras. The second class of men, known as k\u1e63atriyas, are especially meant for governing a country under the direction of saintly persons (br\u0101hma\u1e47as) who are supposed to be very intelligent. In other ages \u2014 in Satya-yuga, Tret\u0101-yuga and Dv\u0101para-yuga \u2014 the general populace was not so degraded, and the head of government was never elected. The king was the supreme executive personality, and if he caught any ministers stealing like thieves and rogues, he would at once have them killed or dismissed from service. As it was the duty of the king to kill thieves and rogues, it was similarly his duty to immediately kill dishonest ministers in government service. By such strict vigilance, the king could run the government very well, and the citizens would be happy to have such a king. The conclusion is that unless the king is perfectly able to give protection to the citizens from rogues and thieves, he has no right to levy taxes from the citizens for his own sense gratification. However, if he gives all protection to the citizens and levies taxes on them, he can live very happily and peacefully in this life, and at the end of this life be elevated to the heavenly kingdom or even to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas, where he will be happy in all respects."

        "purport": " The state\u2019s duty and the citizen\u2019s duty are very nicely explained in this verse. The activities of the government head, or king, as well as the activities of the citizens, should be so directed that ultimately everyone engages in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The king, or government head, is supposed to be the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is therefore supposed to see that things go on nicely and that the citizens are situated in the scientific social order comprised of four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is stated that unless people are educated or situated in the scientific social order comprised of four var\u1e47as (br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra) and four \u0101\u015bramas (brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa), society can never be considered real human society, nor can it make any advancement towards the ultimate goal of human life. It is the duty of the government to see that things go on in terms of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama. As stated herein, bhagav\u0101n yaj\u00f1a-p\u016bru\u1e63a\u1e25: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the yaj\u00f1a-p\u016bru\u1e63a. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29): bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101m. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate purpose of all sacrifice. He is also the enjoyer of all sacrifices; therefore He is known as yaj\u00f1a-p\u016bru\u1e63a. The word yaj\u00f1a-p\u016bru\u1e63a indicates Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or any Personality of Godhead in the category of vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva. In perfect human society, people are situated in the orders of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama and are engaged in worshiping Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u by their respective activities. Every citizen engaged in an occupation renders service by the resultant actions of his activities. That is the perfection of life. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.46): \u201cBy worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, man can, in the performance of his own duty, attain perfection.\u201d Thus the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, \u015b\u016bdras and vai\u015byas must execute their prescribed duties as these duties are stated in the \u015b\u0101stras. In this way everyone can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The king, or government head, has to see that the citizens are thus engaged. In other words, the state or the government must not deviate from its duty by declaring that the state is a secular one, which has no interest in whether or not the people advance in var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. Today people engaged in government service and people who rule over the citizens have no respect for the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. They complacently feel that the state is secular. In such a government, no one can be happy. The people must follow the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, and the king must see that they are following it nicely."

        "purport": " It is a fact that the government\u2019s duty is to see that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by the activities of the people as well as by the activities of the government. There is no possibility of happiness if the government or citizenry have no idea of Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the original cause of the cosmic manifestation, or if they have no knowledge of bh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana, who is vi\u015bv\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supersoul, the soul of everyone\u2019s soul. The conclusion is that without engaging in devotional service, neither the citizens nor the government can be happy in any way. At the present moment neither the king nor the governing body is interested in seeing that the people are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, they are more interested in advancing the machinery of sense gratification. Consequently they are becoming more and more implicated in the complex machinery of the stringent laws of nature. People should be freed from the entanglement of the three modes of material nature, and the only process by which this is possible is surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is advised in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Unfortunately neither the government nor the people in general have any idea of this; they are simply interested in sense gratification and in being happy in this life. The word nija-\u015b\u0101sane (\u201cin his own governmental duty\u201d) indicates that both the government and the citizens are responsible for the execution of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. Once the populace is situated in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, there is every possibility of real life and prosperity both in this world and in the next."

        "purport": " All Vedic civilization is summarized in this verse: all living entities, either on this planet or on other planets, have to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by their respective duties. When He is satisfied, all necessities of life are automatically supplied. In the Vedas it is also stated: eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13). From the Vedas we understand that He is supplying everyone\u2019s necessities, and we can actually see that the lower animals \u2014 the birds and the beasts \u2014 have no business or profession yet are not dying for want of food. They are all living in nature\u2019s way, and they all have the necessities of life provided, namely eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Human society, however, has artificially created a type of civilization which makes one forgetful of his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Modern society even enables one to forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s grace and mercy. Consequently modern civilized man is always unhappy and in need of things. People do not know that the ultimate goal of life is to approach Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and satisfy Him. They have taken this materialistic way of life as everything and have become captivated by materialistic activities. Indeed, their leaders are always encouraging them to follow this path, and the general populace, being ignorant of the laws of God, are following their blind leaders down the path of unhappiness. In order to rectify this world situation, all people should be trained in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and act in accordance with the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system. The state should also see that the people are engaged in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the primary duty of the state. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement was started to convince the general populace to adopt the best process by which to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus solve all problems."

We can appreciate the extent to which the saintly sages actually controlled the king. If the king or government becomes demonic, it is the duty of a saintly person to upset the government and replace it with deserving persons who follow the orders and instructions of saintly persons."

        "purport": " Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the topmost section of human society, are mostly devotees. They are generally unaware of the happenings within the material world because they are always busy in their activities for spiritual advancement. Nonetheless, when there is a calamity in human society, they cannot remain impartial. If they do not do something to relieve the distressed condition of human society, it is said that due to such neglect their spiritual knowledge diminishes. Almost all the sages go to the Him\u0101layas for their personal benefit, but Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said that he did not want liberation alone. He decided to wait until he was able to deliver all the fallen souls of the world. In their elevated condition, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are called Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. There are two types of br\u0101hma\u1e47as \u2014 namely, br\u0101hma\u1e47a-pa\u1e47\u1e0dita and br\u0101hma\u1e47a-vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. A qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a is naturally very learned, but when his learning is advanced in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes a br\u0101hma\u1e47a-vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Unless one becomes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, one\u2019s perfection of brahminical culture is incomplete. The saintly persons considered very wisely that although King Vena was very sinful, he was born in a family descending from Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Therefore the semen in the family must be protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Ke\u015bava. As such, the sages wanted to take some steps to relieve the situation. For want of a king, everything was being disturbed and turned topsy-turvy."

Unless this purificatory process is strictly observed, especially by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the family descendants become impure, and gradually sinful activities become visible in the family. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja A\u1e45ga was very pure because of the purification of semen in the family of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva. However, his semen became contaminated in association with his wife, Sun\u012bth\u0101, who happened to be the daughter of death personified. Because of this polluted semen, King Vena was produced. This was a catastrophe in the family of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja.

Consequently, the ingredients by which another body could be produced were there in the body of King Vena. By a certain process, when the thighs of the dead body were churned, another body came out. Although dead, the body of King Vena was preserved by drugs and by mantras chanted by King Vena\u2019s mother. In this way the ingredients for the production of another body were there. When the body of the person named B\u0101huka came out of the dead body of King Vena, it was really not very astonishing. It was simply a question of knowing how to do it.

Engagement in the transcendental loving devotional service of the Lord can make anyone, however sinful he may be, fit to return home, back to Godhead. One has only to become free from all contamination by the process of devotional service. In this way everyone can become fit to return home, back to Godhead.
