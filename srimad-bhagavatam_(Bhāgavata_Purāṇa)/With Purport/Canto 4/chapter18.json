        "translation": "To benefit all human society, not only in this life but in the next, the great seers and sages have prescribed various methods conducive to the prosperity of the people in general.",
        "purport": " Vedic civilization takes advantage of the perfect knowledge presented in the Vedas and presented by great sages and br\u0101hma\u1e47as for the benefit of human society. Vedic injunctions are known as \u015bruti, and the additional supplementary presentations of these principles, as given by the great sages, are known as sm\u1e5bti. They follow the principles of Vedic instruction. Human society should take advantage of the instructions from both \u015bruti and sm\u1e5bti. If one wants to advance in spiritual life, he must take these instructions and follow the principles. In Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that if one poses himself as advanced in spiritual life but does not refer to the \u015brutis and sm\u1e5btis he is simply a disturbance in society. One should follow the principles laid down in \u015brutis and sm\u1e5btis not only in one\u2019s spiritual life but in material life as well. As far as human society is concerned, it should follow the Manu-sm\u1e5bti as well, for these laws are given by Manu, the father of mankind. In the Manu-sm\u1e5bti it is stated that a woman should not be given independence, but should be given protection by her father, husband and elderly sons. In all circumstances a woman should remain dependent upon some guardian. Presently women are given full independence like men, but actually we can see that such independent women are no happier than those women who are placed under guardians. If people follow the injunctions given by the great sages, \u015brutis and sm\u1e5btis, they can actually be happy in both this life and the next. Unfortunately rascals are manufacturing so many ways and means to be happy. Everyone is inventing so many methods. Consequently human society has lost the standard ways of life, both materially and spiritually, and as a result people are bewildered and there is no peace or happiness in the world. Although they are trying to solve the problems of human society in the United Nations, they are still baffled. Because they do not follow the liberated instructions of the Vedas, they are unhappy. Two significant words used in this verse are asmin and amu\u1e63min. Asmin means \u201cin this life,\u201d and amu\u1e63min means \u201cin the next life.\u201d Unfortunately, in this age even exalted professors and learned men believe that there is no next life and that everything is finished in this life. Since they are rascals and fools, what advice can they give? Still they are passing as learned scholars and professors. In this verse the word amu\u1e63min is very explicit. It is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will have a profitable next life. Just as a boy is educated in order to become happy later, one should be educated in this life in order to attain an eternal and prosperous life after death. It is therefore essential that people follow what is given in the \u015brutis and sm\u1e5btis to make sure that the human mission is successful."

This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement directly receives instructions from the Supreme Personality of Godhead via persons who are strictly following His instructions. Although a follower may not be a liberated person, if he follows the supreme, liberated Personality of Godhead, his actions are naturally liberated from the contamination of the material nature. Lord Caitanya therefore says, \u201cBy My order you may become a spiritual master.\u201d One can immediately become a spiritual master by having full faith in the transcendental words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by following His instructions. Materialistic men are not interested in taking directions from a liberated person, but they are very much interested in their own concocted ideas, which make them repeatedly fail in their attempts.

All necessities grown on earth \u2014 namely fruits, flowers, trees, grains, animals and animal by-products \u2014 were created for use in sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. However, the planet earth in the shape of a cow herein submits that all these utilities are being used by nondevotees, who have no plans for spiritual understanding. Although there are immense potencies within the earth for the production of grains, fruits and flowers, this production is checked by the earth itself when it is misused by nondevotees, who have no spiritual goals. Everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and everything can be used for His satisfaction. Things should not be used for the sense gratification of the living entities. This is the whole plan of material nature according to the directions of this material nature. In this verse the words asadbhi\u1e25 and adh\u1e5bta-vratai\u1e25 are important. The word asadbhi\u1e25 refers to the nondevotees. The nondevotees have been described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as du\u1e63k\u1e5btina\u1e25 (miscreants), m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25 (asses or rascals), nar\u0101dham\u0101\u1e25 (lowest of mankind) and m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 (those who have lost their knowledge to the power of the illusory energy). All these persons are asat, nondevotees. Nondevotees are also called g\u1e5bha-vrata, whereas the devotee is called dh\u1e5bta-vrata. The whole Vedic plan is that the misguided conditioned souls who have come to lord it over material nature should be trained to become dh\u1e5bta-vrata. This means that they should take a vow to satisfy their senses or enjoy material life only by satisfying the senses of the Supreme Lord. Activities intended to satisfy the senses of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are called k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101rthe\u00a0\u2019khila-ce\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25. This indicates that one can attempt all kinds of work, but one should do so to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma. The word yaj\u00f1a indicates Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. We should work only for His satisfaction. In modern times (Kali-yuga), however, people have forgotten Vi\u1e63\u1e47u altogether, and they conduct their activities for sense gratification. Such people will gradually become poverty-stricken, for they cannot use things which are to be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord for their own sense gratification. If they continue like this, there will ultimately be a state of poverty, and no grains, fruits or flowers will be produced. Indeed, it is stated in the Twelfth Canto of Bh\u0101gavatam that at the end of Kali-yuga people will be so polluted that there will no longer be any grains, wheat, sugarcane or milk."

Indeed, I am being neglected by kings who are not punishing these rascals who have turned into thieves by using grains for sense gratification.

        "purport": " That which happened during the time of P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and his father, King Vena, is also happening at this present moment. A huge arrangement exists for the production of large-scale industrial and agricultural products, but all these products are meant for sense gratification. Therefore despite such productive capacities there is scarcity because the world\u2019s population is full of thieves. The word cor\u012b-bh\u016bte indicates that the population has turned to thievery. According to Vedic understanding, men are transformed into thieves when they plan economic development for sense gratification. It is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that if one eats food grains without offering them to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Yaj\u00f1a, he is a thief and liable to be punished. According to spiritual communism, all properties on the surface of the globe belong to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The population has a right to use goods only after offering them to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the process of accepting pras\u0101da. Unless one eats pras\u0101da, he is certainly a thief. It is the duty of governors and kings to punish such thieves and maintain the world nicely. If this is not done, grains will no longer be produced, and people will simply starve. Indeed, not only will people be obliged to eat less, but they will kill one another and eat each other\u2019s flesh. They are already killing animals for flesh, so when there will no longer be grains, vegetables and fruits, they will kill their own sons and fathers and eat their flesh for sustenance."

        "purport": " When there is a scarcity of grain, the government should follow the methods prescribed in the \u015b\u0101stra and approved by the \u0101c\u0101ryas; thus there will be a sufficient production of grains, and food scarcity and famine can be checked. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 recommends that we perform yaj\u00f1a, sacrifices. By the performance of yaj\u00f1a, sufficient clouds gather in the sky, and when there are sufficient clouds, there is also sufficient rainfall. In this way agricultural matters are taken care of. When there is sufficient grain production, the general populace eats the grains, and animals like cows, goats and other domestic animals eat the grasses and grains also. According to this arrangement, human beings should perform the sacrifices recommended in the \u015b\u0101stras, and if they do so there will no longer be food scarcity. In Kali-yuga, the only sacrifice recommended is sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. In this verse there are two significant words: yogena, \u201cby the approved method,\u201d and d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dena, \u201cas exemplified by the former \u0101c\u0101ryas.\u201d One is mistaken if he thinks that by applying modern machines such as tractors, grains can be produced. If one goes to a desert and uses a tractor, there is still no possibility of producing grains. We may adopt various means, but it is essential to know that the planet earth will stop producing grains if sacrifices are not performed. The earth has already explained that because nondevotees are enjoying the production of food, she has reserved food seeds for the performance of sacrifice. Now, of course, atheists will not believe in this spiritual method of producing grains, but whether they believe or not, the fact remains that we are not independent to produce grain by mechanical means. As far as the approved method is concerned, it is enjoined in the \u015b\u0101stras that intelligent men in this age will take to the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement, and by so doing they shall worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Caitanya, whose bodily complexion is golden and who is always accompanied by His confidential devotees to preach this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement all over the world. In its present condition, the world can only be saved by introducing this sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. As we have learned from the previous verse, one who is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is considered a thief. Even though he may be materially very advanced, a thief cannot be placed in a comfortable position. A thief is a thief, and he is punishable. Because people are without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, they have become thieves, and consequently they are being punished by the laws of material nature. No one can check this, not even by introducing so many relief funds and humanitarian institutions. Unless the people of the world take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there will be a scarcity of food and much suffering."

The ungodly human being, ignorant of his duty to give protection and food to the animals, kills them to compensate for the insufficient production of grains. Thus no one is satisfied, and that is the cause for the present condition in today\u2019s world."

        "translation": "The fortunate inhabitants of Pit\u1e5bloka, who preside over the funeral ceremonies, made Aryam\u0101 into a calf. With great faith they milked kavya, food offered to the ancestors, into an unbaked earthen pot.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25) it is said, pit\u1e5dn y\u0101nti pit\u1e5b-vrat\u0101\u1e25. Those who are interested in family welfare are called pit\u1e5b-vrat\u0101\u1e25. There is a planet called Pit\u1e5bloka, and the predominating deity of that planet is called Aryam\u0101. He is somewhat of a demigod, and by satisfying him one can help ghostly family members develop a gross body. Those who are very sinful and attached to their family, house, village or country do not receive a gross body made of material elements but remain in a subtle body, composed of mind, ego and intelligence. Those who live in such subtle bodies are called ghosts. This ghostly position is very painful because a ghost has intelligence, mind and ego and wants to enjoy material life, but because he doesn\u2019t have a gross material body, he can only create disturbances for want of material satisfaction. It is the duty of family members, especially the son, to offer oblations to the demigod Aryam\u0101 or to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. From time immemorial in India, the son of a dead man goes to Gay\u0101 and, at a Vi\u1e63\u1e47u temple there, offers oblations for the benefit of his ghostly father. It is not that everyone\u2019s father becomes a ghost, but the oblations of pi\u1e47\u1e0da are offered to the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u so that if a family member happens to become a ghost, he will be favored with a gross body. However, if one is habituated to taking the pras\u0101da of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, there is no chance of his becoming a ghost or anything lower than a human being. In Vedic civilization there is a performance called \u015br\u0101ddha by which food is offered with faith and devotion. If one offers oblations with faith and devotion \u2014 either to the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or to His representative in Pit\u1e5bloka, Aryam\u0101 \u2014 one\u2019s forefathers will attain material bodies to enjoy whatever material enjoyment is due them. In other words, they do not have to become ghosts."

Just as fish can swim within water, the residents of Vidy\u0101dhara-loka can swim in the ocean of air. As far as the inhabitants of Siddhaloka are concerned, they are endowed with all mystic powers. The yog\u012bs in this planet practice the eightfold yogic mysticism \u2014 namely yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na and sam\u0101dhi. By regularly practicing the yogic processes one after another, the yog\u012bs attain various perfections; they can become smaller than the smallest, heavier than the heaviest, etc. They can even manufacture a planet, get whatever they like and control whatever man they want. All the residents of Siddhaloka are naturally endowed with these mystic yogic powers. It is certainly a very wonderful thing if we see a person on this planet flying in the sky without a vehicle, but in Vidy\u0101dhara-loka such flying is as commonplace as a bird\u2019s flying in the sky. Similarly, in Siddhaloka all the inhabitants are great yog\u012bs, perfect in mystic powers. The name of Kapila Muni is significant in this verse because He was the expounder of the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophical system, and His father, Kardama Muni, was a great yog\u012b and mystic. Indeed, Kardama Muni prepared a great airplane, which was as large as a small town and had various gardens, palatial buildings, servants and maidservants. With all this paraphernalia, Kapiladeva\u2019s mother, Devah\u016bti, and His father, Kardama Muni, traveled all over the universes and visited different planets."

Thus they got fresh green grasses to eat. Ferocious animals like tigers transformed a lion into a calf, and thus they were able to get flesh for milk. The birds made a calf out of Garu\u1e0da and took milk from the planet earth in the form of moving insects and nonmoving plants and grasses.",

Indeed, there is a particular type of bird that is very fond of eating monkeys, and eagles are fond of eating goats. Of course, many birds eat only fruits and berries. Therefore the words caram, referring to moving animals, and acaram, referring to grasses, fruits and vegetables, are mentioned in this verse."

In India we can see regular planning methods evident in very old cities. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam there are many descriptions of such ancient cities. Even five thousand years ago, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s capital, Dv\u0101rak\u0101, was well planned, and similar other cities \u2014 Mathur\u0101 and Hastin\u0101pura (now New Delhi) \u2014 were also well planned. Thus the planning of cities and towns is not a modern innovation but was existing in bygone ages."
