Kum\u0101r\u012b, or unmarried girls untouched by the hand of any member of the opposite sex, are auspicious members of society.

They are very carefully protected by their parents while unmarried, after marriage they are protected by their young husbands, and when elderly they are protected by their children. When thus protected, women as a class remain an always auspicious source of energy to man."

Besides that, as exemplified by King P\u1e5bthu, he must develop the earth for the greatest possible production of food grains. There are different types of great personalities \u2014 some are positive great personalities, some comparative and some superlative \u2014 but King P\u1e5bthu exceeded all of them.

Similarly, br\u0101hma\u1e47as, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras can discharge their respective duties perfectly and thus at the ultimate end of life be promoted to the transcendental world, which is called para\u1e41 padam. Para\u1e41 padam, or the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, can be achieved only by devotional service. The impersonal Brahman region is also called para\u1e41 padam, but unless one is attached to the Personality of Godhead one must again fall down to the material world from the impersonal para\u1e41 padam situation. It is said, therefore, \u0101ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25: the impersonalists endeavor very strenuously to achieve the para\u1e41 padam, or impersonal brahmajyoti, but unfortunately, being bereft of a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they come down again to the material world. If one flies in outer space he can go very high up, but unless he reaches a planet he must come down again to earth. Similarly, because the impersonalists who reach the para\u1e41 padam of the impersonal brahmajyoti do not enter into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, they come down again to this material world and are given shelter in one of the material planets. Although they may attain Brahmaloka, or Satyaloka, all such planets are situated in the material world."

Thus blessed by them, he ruled over the earth and exploited its resources for the greatest satisfaction of the people in general.

Regardless of whether the chief executive is a king or president, or whether the government is monarchical or democratic, this process is so perfect that if it is followed, everyone will become happy, and thus it will be very easy for all to execute devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Because he was very opulent, it appeared that he was enjoying his destined fortune in order to diminish the results of his past pious activities.",
        "purport": " The terms \u201cpious\u201d and \u201cimpious\u201d are applicable only in reference to the activities of an ordinary living being. But Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was a directly empowered incarnation of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; therefore he was not subject to the reactions of pious or impious activities. As we have already explained previously, when a living being is specifically empowered by the Supreme Lord to act for a particular purpose, he is called a \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba-avat\u0101ra. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was not only a \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba-avat\u0101ra but also a great devotee. A devotee is not subjected to the reactions resulting from past deeds. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said, karm\u0101\u1e47i nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bh\u0101j\u0101m: for devotees the results of past pious and impious activities are nullified by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words \u0101rabdh\u0101n eva mean \u201cas if achieved by past deeds,\u201d but in the case of P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja there was no question of reaction to past deeds, and thus the word eva is used here to indicate comparison to ordinary persons. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25. This means that sometimes people misunderstand an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be an ordinary man. The Supreme Godhead, His incarnations or His devotees may pose themselves as ordinary men, but they are never to be considered as such. Nor should an ordinary man not supported by authorized statements of the \u015b\u0101stras and \u0101c\u0101ryas be accepted as an incarnation or devotee. By the evidence of \u015b\u0101stra, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b detected Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu to be a direct incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although Lord Caitanya never disclosed the fact. It is therefore generally recommended that the \u0101c\u0101rya, or guru, should not be accepted as an ordinary man."

        "translation": "Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was an unrivaled king and possessed the scepter for ruling all the seven islands on the surface of the globe. No one could disobey his irrevocable orders but the saintly persons, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the descendants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead [the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas].",
        "purport": " Sapta-dv\u012bpa refers to the seven great islands or continents on the surface of the globe: (1) Asia, (2) Europe, (3) Africa, (4) North America, (5) South America, (6) Australia and (7) Oceania. In the modern age people are under the impression that during the Vedic period or the prehistoric ages America and many other parts of the world had not been discovered, but that is not a fact. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja ruled over the world many thousands of years before the so-called prehistoric age, and it is clearly mentioned here that in those days not only were all the different parts of the world known, but they were ruled by one king, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu. The country where P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja resided must have been India because it is stated in the eleventh verse of this chapter that he lived in the tract of land between the rivers Ganges and Yamun\u0101. This tract of land, which is called Brahm\u0101varta, consists of what is known in the modern age as portions of Punjab and northern India. It is clear that the kings of India once ruled all the world and that their culture was Vedic. The word askhalita indicates that orders by the king could not be disobeyed by anyone in the entire world. Such orders, however, were never issued to control saintly persons or the descendants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Supreme Lord is known as Acyuta, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is addressed as such by Arjuna in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (senayor ubhayor madhye ratha\u1e41 sth\u0101paya me\u00a0\u2019cyuta). Acyuta refers to one who does not fall because He is never influenced by the modes of material nature. When a living entity falls down to the material world from his original position, he becomes cyuta, which means that he forgets his relationship with Acyuta. Actually every living entity is a part and parcel, or a son, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When influenced by the modes of material nature, a living entity forgets this relationship and thinks in terms of different species of life; but when he again comes to his original consciousness, he does not observe such bodily designations. This is indicated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.18) by the words pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25 sama-dar\u015bina\u1e25. Material designations create differentiation in terms of caste, color, creed, nationality, etc. Different gotras, or family designations, are distinctions in terms of the material body, but when one comes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness he immediately becomes one of the Acyuta-gotra, or descendants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus becomes transcendental to all considerations of caste, creed, color and nationality. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had no control over the br\u0101hma\u1e47a-kula, which refers to the learned scholars in Vedic knowledge, nor over the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, who are above the considerations of Vedic knowledge. It is therefore said: \u201cOne who thinks the Deity in the temple to be made of wood or stone, who thinks of the spiritual master in the disciplic succession as an ordinary man, who thinks the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava in the Acyuta-gotra to belong to a certain caste or creed or who thinks of cara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta or Ganges water as ordinary water is taken to be a resident of hell.\u201d (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a) From the facts presented in this verse, it appears that people in general should be controlled by a king until they come to the platform of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who are not under the control of anyone. Br\u0101hma\u1e47a refers to one who knows Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth, and a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is one who serves the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

He did not, however, present himself as a royal authority empowered to command everyone, for he wanted to present his statement in humble submission before the assembly of great sages and saintly persons. As a great king of the entire world, he could have given them orders, but he was so humble, meek and honest that he presented his statement for approval in order to clarify his mature decision.

        "purport": " A king is supposed to be appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to look after the interests of his particular planet. On every planet there is a predominating person, just as we now see that in every country there is a president. If one is president or king, it should be understood that this opportunity has been given to him by the Supreme Lord. According to the Vedic system, the king is considered a representative of Godhead and is offered respects by the citizens as God in the human form of life. Actually, according to Vedic information, the Supreme Lord maintains all living entities, and especially human beings, to elevate them to the highest perfection. After many, many births in lower species, when a living entity evolves to the human form of life and in particular to the civilized human form of life, his society must be divided into four gradations, as ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam, etc.). The four social orders \u2014 the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras \u2014 are natural divisions of human society, and as declared by P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, every man in his respective social order must have proper employment for his livelihood. It is the duty of the king or the government to insure that the people observe the social order and that they are also employed in their respective occupational duties. In modern times, since the protection of the government or the king has been withdrawn, social order has practically collapsed. No one knows who is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who is a k\u1e63atriya, who is a vai\u015bya or who is a \u015b\u016bdra, and people claim to belong to a particular social order by birthright only. It is the duty of the government to reestablish social order in terms of occupational duties and the modes of material nature, for that will make the entire world population actually civilized. If it does not observe the institutional functions of the four social orders, human society is no better than animal society, in which there is never tranquillity, peace and prosperity but only chaos and confusion. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, as an ideal king, strictly observed the maintenance of the Vedic social order. Praj\u0101yate iti praj\u0101. The word praj\u0101 refers to one who takes birth. Therefore P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja guaranteed protection for praj\u0101n\u0101m \u2014 all living entities who took birth in his kingdom. Praj\u0101 refers not only to human beings but also to animals, trees and every other living entity. It is the duty of the king to give all living entities protection and food. The fools and rascals of modern society have no knowledge of the extent of the responsibility of the government. Animals are also citizens of the land in which they happen to be born, and they also have the right to continue their existence at the cost of the Supreme Lord. The disturbance of the animal population by wholesale slaughter produces a catastrophic future reaction for the butcher, his land and his government."

        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu gives special stress to the word brahma-v\u0101dina\u1e25, \u201cby the experts in the Vedic knowledge.\u201d Brahma refers to the Vedas, which are also known as \u015babda-brahma, or transcendental sound. Transcendental sound is not ordinary language, although it appears to be written in ordinary language. Evidence from the Vedic literature should be accepted as final authority. In the Vedic literature there is much information, and of course there is information about the execution of a king\u2019s duty. A responsible king who executes his appointed duty by giving proper protection to all living entities on his planet is promoted to the heavenly planetary system. This is also dependent upon the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. It is not that if one executes his duty properly he is automatically promoted, for promotion depends upon the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It must ultimately be concluded that one can achieve the desired result of his activities upon satisfying the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed in the First Canto, Second Chapter, of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: The perfection of one\u2019s execution of his appointed duties is the ultimate satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. The word k\u0101ma-sandoh\u0101\u1e25 means \u201cachievement of the desired result.\u201d Everyone desires to achieve the ultimate goal of life, but in modern civilization the great scientists think that man\u2019s life has no plan. This gross ignorance is very dangerous and makes civilization very risky. People do not know the laws of nature, which are the rulings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they are atheists of the first order, they have no faith in the existence of God and His rulings and therefore do not know how nature is working. This gross ignorance of the mass of people, including even the so-called scientists and philosophers, makes life a risky situation in which human beings do not know whether they are making progress in life. According to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (7.5.30), they are simply progressing to the darkest region of material existence (ad\u0101nta-gobhir vi\u015bat\u0101\u1e41 tamisram). The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has therefore been started to give philosophers, scientists, and people in general the proper knowledge about the destiny of life. Everyone should take advantage of this movement and learn the real goal of life."

The laws of nature are very subtle. For example, if one eats in a place which is very sinful, he shares in the resultant reaction of the sinful activities performed there. (It is a Vedic system, therefore, for a householder to call br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas to eat at ceremonial performances in his house because the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas can immunize him from sinful activities.

Otherwise, why should there be persons who are unusually beautiful and powerful both in this life and in the life after death?",
        "purport": " P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s sole aim in ruling his kingdom was to raise the citizens to the standard of God consciousness. Since there was a great assembly in the arena of sacrifice, there were different types of men present, but he was especially interested in speaking to those who were not atheists. It has already been explained in the previous verses that P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja advised the citizens to become adhok\u1e63aja-dhiya\u1e25, which means God conscious, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, and in this verse he specifically presents the authority of \u015b\u0101stra, even though his father was a number-one atheist who did not abide by the injunctions mentioned in the Vedic \u015b\u0101stras, who practically stopped all sacrificial performances, and who so disgusted the br\u0101hma\u1e47as that they not only dethroned him but cursed and killed him. Atheistic men do not believe in the existence of God, and thus they understand everything which is happening in our daily affairs to be due to physical arrangement and chance. Atheists believe in the atheistic S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy of the combination of prak\u1e5bti and puru\u1e63a. They believe only in matter and hold that matter under certain conditions of amalgamation gives rise to the living force, which then appears as puru\u1e63a, the enjoyer; then, by a combination of matter and the living force, the many varieties of material manifestation come into existence. Nor do atheists believe in the injunctions of the Vedas. According to them, all the Vedic injunctions are simply theories that have no practical application in life. Taking all this into consideration, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja suggested that theistic men will solidly reject the views of the atheists on the grounds that there cannot be many varieties of existence without the plan of a superior intelligence. Atheists very vaguely explain that these varieties of existence occur simply by chance, but the theists who believe in the injunctions of the Vedas must reach all their conclusions under the direction of the Vedas. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said that the entire var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution is meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The rules and regulations set up for the execution of the duties of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras or brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, g\u1e5bhasthas, v\u0101naprasthas and sanny\u0101s\u012bs are all meant to satisfy the Supreme Lord. At the present moment, although the so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras have lost their original culture, they claim to be br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras by birthright. Yet they have rejected the proposition that such social and spiritual orders are especially meant for worship of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The dangerous M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da theory set forth by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya \u2014 that God is impersonal \u2014 does not tally with the injunctions of the Vedas. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore described the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers as the greatest offenders against the Personality of Godhead. According to the Vedic system, one who does not abide by the orders of the Vedas is called a n\u0101stika, or atheist. When Lord Buddha preached his theory of nonviolence, he was obliged to deny the authority of the Vedas, and for this reason he was considered by the followers of the Vedas to be a n\u0101stika. But although \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu very clearly enunciated that the followers of Lord Buddha\u2019s philosophy are n\u0101stikas, or atheists, because of their denial of the authority of the Vedas, He considered the \u015aa\u1e45karites, who wanted to establish Vedic authority by trickery and who actually followed the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy of Buddha\u2019s school, to be more dangerous than the Buddhists themselves. The \u015aa\u1e45karite philosophers\u2019 theory that we have to imagine a shape of God is more dangerous than denial of the existence of God. Notwithstanding all the philosophical theorizing by atheists or M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, the followers of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness rigidly live according to the injunctions given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which is accepted as the essence of all Vedic scripture. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.46) it is said: \u201cBy worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, man can, in the performance of his own duty, attain perfection.\u201d This indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original source of everything, as described in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25). The Lord Himself also confirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25: \u201cI am the origin of everything.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original source of all emanations, and at the same time, as Param\u0101tm\u0101, He is spread all over existence. The Absolute Truth is therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and every living being is meant to satisfy the Supreme Godhead by performing his respective duty (sva-karma\u1e47\u0101 tam abhyarcya). Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu wanted to introduce this formula amongst his citizens. The most important point in human civilization is that while one engages in different occupational duties, he must try to satisfy the Supreme Lord by the execution of such duties. That is the highest perfection of life. Svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhitasya dharmasya sa\u1e41siddhir hari-to\u1e63a\u1e47am: by discharging one\u2019s prescribed duty, one can become very successful in life if he simply satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The vivid example is Arjuna. He was a k\u1e63atriya, his duty was to fight, and by executing his prescribed duty he satisfied the Supreme Lord and therefore became perfect. Everyone should follow this principle. The atheists, who do not, are condemned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.19) by the following statement: t\u0101n aha\u1e41 dvi\u1e63ata\u1e25 kr\u016br\u0101n sa\u1e41s\u0101re\u1e63u nar\u0101dham\u0101n. In this verse it is clearly said that persons who are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are the lowest of mankind and are very mischievous. Under the regulative principles of the Supreme, such mischievous persons are thrown into the darkest region of material existence and are born of asuras, or atheists. Birth after birth, such asuras go still further down, finally to animal forms like those of tigers or similar ferocious beasts. Thus for millions of years they have to remain in darkness without knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as Puru\u1e63ottama, or the best of all living entities. He is a person like all other living entities, but He is the leader or the best of all living beings. That is stated in the Vedas also: nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m. He is the chief of all eternals, the chief of all living entities, and He is complete and full. He has no need to derive benefit by interfering with the affairs of other living entities, but because He is the maintainer of all, He has the right to bring them to the proper standard so that all living entities may become happy. A father wants all of his children to become happy under his direction. Similarly, God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has the right to see that all living entities are happy. There is no possibility of becoming happy within this material world. The father and the sons are eternal, but if a living entity does not come to the platform of his eternal life of bliss and knowledge, there is no question of happiness. Although Puru\u1e63ottama, the best of all living entities, has no benefit to derive from the common living entities, He does have the right to discriminate between their right and wrong ways. The right way is the path of activities meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as we have already discussed (svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhitasya dharmasya sa\u1e41siddhir hari-to\u1e63a\u1e47am). A living entity may engage in any occupational duty, but if he wants to have perfection in his duties, he must satisfy the Supreme Lord. As such, one who pleases Him gets better facilities for living, but one who displeases Him gets involved in undesirable situations. It is therefore concluded that there are two kinds of duties \u2014 mundane duty and duty performed for the sake of yaj\u00f1a, or sacrifice (yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma). Any karma (activity) one performs which is not for the purpose of yaj\u00f1a is a cause of bondage. Yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o \u2019nyatra loko \u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25: \u201cWork done as a sacrifice for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has to be performed; otherwise work binds one to this material world.\u201d (Bg. 3.9) Karma-bandhana\u1e25, or the bondage of karma, is administered under the regulations of the stringent laws of material nature. Material existence is a struggle to conquer the impediments put forth by material nature. The asuras are always fighting to overcome these impediments, and by the illusory power of material nature the foolish living entities work very hard within this material world and take this to be happiness. This is called m\u0101y\u0101. In that hard struggle for existence, they deny the existence of the supreme authority, Puru\u1e63ottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In order to regulate the activities of the living entities, God has given us codes, just as a king gives codes of law in a state, and whoever breaks the law is punished. Similarly, the Lord has given the infallible knowledge of the Vedas, which are not contaminated by the four defects of human life \u2014 namely the tendency to commit mistakes, to be illusioned, to cheat and to have imperfect senses. If we do not take direction from the Vedas but act whimsically according to our own choice, we are sure to be punished by the laws of the Lord, who offers different types of bodies in the 8,400,000 species of forms. Material existence, or the sense gratification process, is conducted according to the type of body we are given by prak\u1e5bti, or material nature. As such, there must be divisions of pious and impious activities (pu\u1e47ya and p\u0101pa). In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.28) it is clearly stated: \u201cOne who has completely surpassed the resultant activities of the impious path of life [this is possible only when one engages exclusively in pious activities] can understand his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one engages in the Lord\u2019s transcendental loving service.\u201d This life of engaging always in the loving service of the Lord is called adhok\u1e63aja-dhiya\u1e25, or a life of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which King P\u1e5bthu meant his citizens to follow. The different varieties of life and of material existence do not come about by chance and necessity; they are different arrangements made by the Supreme Lord in terms of the pious and impious activities of the living entities. By performing pious activities one can take birth in a good family in a good nation, one can get a beautiful body, or one can become very well educated or very rich. We see, therefore, that in different places and in different planets there are different standards of life, bodily features and educational statuses, all awarded by the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to pious or impious activities. Varieties of life, therefore, develop not by chance but by prearrangement. There is a plan, which is already outlined in the Vedic knowledge. One has to take advantage of this knowledge and mold his life in such a way that at the end, especially in the human form of life, he may go back home, back to Godhead, by practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The theory of chance can best be explained in the Vedic literature by the words aj\u00f1\u0101ta-suk\u1e5bti, which refer to pious activities performed without the actor\u2019s knowledge. But these are also planned. For example, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes like an ordinary human being, He comes as a devotee like Lord Caitanya, or He sends His representative, the spiritual master, or pure devotee. This is also the planned activity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They come to canvass and educate, and thus a person in the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord gets a chance to mix with them, talk with them and take lessons from them, and somehow or other if a conditioned soul surrenders to such personalities and by intimate association with them chances to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he is saved from the material conditions of life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore instructs: \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\u201d (Bg. 18.66) The word sarva-p\u0101pebhya\u1e25 means \u201cfrom all sinful activities.\u201d A person who surrenders unto Him by utilizing the chance to associate with the pure devotee, spiritual master or other authorized incarnations of Godhead, like P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, is saved by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then his life becomes successful."

        "purport": " King Vena, the father of P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, was condemned by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and saintly persons because of his denying the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and rejecting the method of satisfying Him by performance of Vedic sacrifice. In other words, he was an atheist, who did not believe in the existence of God, and who consequently stopped all Vedic ritualistic ceremonies in his kingdom. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja considered King Vena\u2019s character abominable because Vena was foolish regarding the execution of religious performances. Atheists are of the opinion that there is no need to accept the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be successful in religion, economic development, sense gratification or liberation. According to them, dharma, or religious principles, are meant to establish an imaginary God to encourage one to become moral, honest and just so that the social orders may be maintained in peace and tranquillity. Furthermore, they say that actually there is no need to accept God for this purpose, for if one follows the principles of morality and honesty, that is sufficient. Similarly, if one makes nice plans and works very hard for economic development, automatically the result of economic development will come. Similarly, sense gratification also does not depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for if one earns enough money by any process, one will have sufficient opportunity for sense gratification. Insofar as liberation is concerned, they say that there is no need to talk of liberation because after death everything is finished. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, did not accept the authority of such atheists, headed by his father, who was the grandson of death personified. Generally, a daughter inherits the qualities of her father, and a son gets the qualities of his mother. Thus M\u1e5btyu\u2019s daughter, Sun\u012bth\u0101, got all the qualities of her father, and Vena inherited the qualities of his mother. A person who is always subjected to the rules and regulations of repeated birth and death cannot accommodate anything beyond materialistic ideas. Since King Vena was such a man, he did not believe in the existence of God. Modern civilization agrees with the principles of King Vena, but factually if we scrutinizingly study all the conditions of religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation, we must accept the principles of the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Vedic literature, religion consists only of the codes of law given by God. If one does not accept the authority of the Supreme Godhead in matters of religion and morality, one must explain why two persons of the same moral standard achieve different results. It is generally found that even if two men have the same moral standards of ethics, honesty and morality, their positions are still not the same. Similarly, in economic development it is seen that if two men work very hard day and night, still the results are not the same. One person may enjoy great opulence without even working, whereas another person, although working very hard, does not even get two sufficient meals a day. Similarly, in the matter of sense gratification, sometimes one who has sufficient food is still not happy in his family affairs or sometimes is not even married, whereas another person, even though not economically well off, has the greatest opportunity for sense gratification. Even an animal like a hog or a dog may have greater opportunities for sense gratification than a human being. Aside from liberation, even if we consider only the preliminary necessities of life \u2014 dharma, artha and k\u0101ma (religion, economic development and sense gratification) \u2014 we will see that they are not the same for everyone. Therefore it must be accepted that there is someone who determines the different standards. In conclusion, not only for liberation must one depend on the Lord, but even for ordinary necessities in this material world. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore indicated that in spite of having rich parents, children are sometimes not happy. Similarly, in spite of valuable medicine administered by a competent physician, sometimes a patient dies; or in spite of having a big safe boat, sometimes a man drowns. We may thus struggle to counteract impediments offered by material nature, but our attempts cannot be successful unless we are favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "translation": "By the inclination to serve the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, suffering humanity can immediately cleanse the dirt which has accumulated in their minds during innumerable births. Like the Ganges water, which emanates from the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord, such a process immediately cleanses the mind, and thus spiritual or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness gradually increases.",
        "purport": " In India, one can actually see that a person who takes a bath in the Ganges waters daily is almost free from all kinds of diseases. A very respectable br\u0101hma\u1e47a in Calcutta never took a doctor\u2019s medicine. Even though he sometimes felt sick, he would not accept medicine from the physician but would simply drink Ganges water, and he was always cured within a very short time. The glories of Ganges water are known to Indians and to ourselves also. The river Ganges flows by Calcutta. Sometimes within the water there are many stools and other dirty things which are washed away from neighboring mills and factories, but still thousands of men take baths in the Ganges water, and they are very healthy as well as spiritually inclined. That is the effect of Ganges water. The Ganges is glorified because it emanates from the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord. Similarly, if one takes to the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, or takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is immediately cleansed of the many dirty things which have accumulated in his innumerable births. We have seen that in spite of the very black record of their past lives, persons who take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness become perfectly cleansed of all dirty things and make spiritual progress very swiftly. Therefore P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja advises that without the benediction of the Supreme Lord one cannot make advancement, either in so-called morality, economic development or sense gratification. One should therefore take to the service of the Lord, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thus very soon become a perfect man, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (k\u1e63ipra\u1e41 bhavati dharm\u0101tm\u0101 \u015ba\u015bvac-ch\u0101nti\u1e41 nigacchati). Being a responsible king, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja recommends that everyone take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus be immediately purified. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that simply by surrendering unto Him one is immediately relieved of all sinful reactions. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a takes away all the sinful reactions of a person immediately upon his surrender unto Him, similarly the external manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who acts as the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, takes all the resultant actions of the sinful life of the disciple immediately after the disciple\u2019s initiation. Thus if the disciple follows the principles instructed by the spiritual master, he remains purified and is not contaminated by the material infection. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore stated that the spiritual master who plays the part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s representative has to consume all the sinful reactions of his disciple. Sometimes a spiritual master takes the risk of being overwhelmed by the sinful reactions of the disciples and undergoes a sort of tribulation due to their acceptance. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore advised that one not accept many disciples."

        "translation": "When a devotee takes shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is completely cleansed of all misunderstanding or mental speculation, and he manifests renunciation. This is possible only when one is strengthened by practicing bhakti-yoga. Once having taken shelter at the root of the lotus feet of the Lord, a devotee never comes back to this material existence, which is full of the threefold miseries.",
        "purport": " As stated by Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu in His \u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka instructions, by the chanting of the holy name of the Lord \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 or by the process of hearing and chanting of the glories of the Lord, one\u2019s mind is gradually cleansed of all dirt. Due to our material association since time immemorial, we have accumulated heaps of dirty things in our minds. The total effect of this takes place when a living entity identifies himself with his body and is thus entrapped by the stringent laws of material nature and put into the cycle of repeated birth and death under the false impression of bodily identification. When one is strengthened by practicing bhakti-yoga, his mind is cleansed of this misunderstanding, and he is no longer interested in material existence or in sense gratification. Bhakti, or devotional service, is characterized by vair\u0101gya and j\u00f1\u0101na. J\u00f1\u0101na refers to understanding that one is not his body, and vair\u0101gya means disinterest in sense gratification. These two primary principles of separation from material bondage can be realized on the strength of bhakti-yoga. Thus when a devotee is fixed in the loving service of the lotus feet of the Lord, he will never come back to this material existence after quitting his body, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the Lord (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so\u00a0\u2019rjuna). In this verse the word vij\u00f1\u0101na is specifically important. J\u00f1\u0101na, the knowledge of spiritual identity that one attains when he does not consider himself to be the body, is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as brahma-bh\u016bta, the revival of spiritual realization. In the conditioned state of material existence one cannot be spiritually realized because he identifies himself materially. The understanding of the distinction between material existence and spiritual existence is called j\u00f1\u0101na. After coming to the platform of j\u00f1\u0101na, or the brahma-bh\u016bta state, one ultimately comes to devotional service, in which he completely understands his own position and the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This understanding is explained here as vij\u00f1\u0101na-vi\u015be\u1e63a. The Lord says, therefore, that knowledge of Him is vij\u00f1\u0101na, science. In other words, when one is strengthened by scientific knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his position of liberation is guaranteed. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.2), the science of devotional service is described as pratyak\u1e63\u0101vagama\u1e41 dharmyam, direct understanding of the principles of religion by realization. By practicing bhakti-yoga, one can directly perceive his advancement in spiritual life. In other practices \u2014 like karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and dhy\u0101na-yoga \u2014 one may not be confident about his progress, but in bhakti-yoga one can become directly aware of his progress in spiritual life, just as a person who eats can understand that his hunger is satisfied. Our false appetite for enjoyment and lordship of the material world is due to a prominence of passion and ignorance. By bhakti-yoga these two qualities are diminished, and one becomes situated in the mode of goodness. Gradually surpassing the mode of goodness, one is situated in pure goodness, which is not contaminated by the material qualities. When thus situated, a devotee no longer has any doubts; he knows that he will not come back to this material world."

According to your abilities and the occupations in which you are situated, you should engage your service at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with full confidence and without reservation. Then you will surely be successful in achieving the final objective in your lives.",
        "purport": " As stated in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sva-karma\u1e47\u0101 tam abhyarcya: one has to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead by one\u2019s occupational duties. This necessitates accepting the principle of four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore says, gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 sva-karmabhi\u1e25. This phrase is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. C\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25: \u201cThe four castes (the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras) are created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the material modes of nature and the particular duties discharged in those modes.\u201d A person who is situated in the mode of goodness is certainly more intelligent than others. Therefore he can practice the brahminical activities \u2014 namely speaking the truth, controlling the senses, controlling the mind, remaining always clean, practicing tolerance, having full knowledge about one\u2019s self-identity, and understanding devotional service. In this way, if he engages himself in the loving service of the Lord as an actual br\u0101hma\u1e47a, his aim to achieve the final interest of life is attained. Similarly, the k\u1e63atriya\u2019s duties are to give protection to the citizens, to give all his possessions in charity, to be strictly Vedic in the management of state affairs and to be unafraid to fight whenever there is an attack by enemies. In this way, a k\u1e63atriya can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his occupational duties. Similarly, a vai\u015bya can satisfy the Supreme Godhead by properly executing his occupational duties \u2014 engaging himself in producing foodstuffs, giving protection to cows, and trading if necessary when there is an excess of agricultural production. Similarly, because \u015b\u016bdras do not have ample intelligence, they should simply engage as workers to serve the higher statuses of social life. Everyone\u2019s aim should be to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by engaging his mind in thinking always of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his words in always offering prayers to the Lord or preaching about the glories of the Lord, and his body in executing the service required to satisfy the Lord. As there are four divisions within our body \u2014 the head, the arms, the belly and the legs \u2014 similarly, human society, taken as a whole, is divided into four classes of men according to their material qualities and occupational duties. Thus the brahminical or intelligent men have to execute the duty of the head, the k\u1e63atriyas must fulfill the duty of the arms, the vai\u015bya class must fulfill the duty of the belly, and the \u015b\u016bdras must fulfill the duty of the legs. In executing the prescribed duties of life, no one is higher or lower; there are such divisions as \u201chigher\u201d and \u201clower,\u201d but since there is actually a common interest \u2014 to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 there are no distinctions between them. The question may be raised that since the Lord is supposed to be worshiped by great demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and others, how can an ordinary human being on this planet serve Him? This is clearly explained by P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja by the use of the word yath\u0101dhik\u0101ra, \u201caccording to one\u2019s ability.\u201d If one sincerely executes his occupational duty, that will be sufficient. One does not need to become like Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, Indra, Lord Caitanya or R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, whose capabilities are certainly far above ours. Even a \u015b\u016bdra, who is in the lowest stage of life according to the material qualities, can achieve the same success. Anyone can become successful in devotional service provided he displays no duplicity. It is explained here that one must be very frank and open-minded (am\u0101yina\u1e25). To be situated in a lower status of life is not a disqualification for success in devotional service. The only qualification is that whether one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra, he must be open, frank and free from reservations. Then, by performing his particular occupational duty under the guidance of a proper spiritual master, he can achieve the highest success in life. As confirmed by the Lord Himself, striyo vai\u015by\u0101s tath\u0101 \u015b\u016bdr\u0101s te\u00a0\u2019pi y\u0101nti par\u0101\u1e41 gatim (Bg. 9.32). It does not matter what one is, whether a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, \u015b\u016bdra or a degraded woman. If one engages himself seriously in devotional service, working with body, mind and intelligence, he is sure to be successful in going back home, back to Godhead. The Lord\u2019s lotus feet are described here as k\u0101ma-dugh\u0101\u1e45ghri-pa\u1e45kajam because they have all power to fulfill the desires of everyone. A devotee is happy even in this life because although in material existence we have many needs, all his material needs are satisfied, and when he at last quits his body, he goes back home, back to Godhead, without a doubt."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental and not contaminated by this material world. But although He is concentrated spirit soul without material variety, for the benefit of the conditioned soul He nevertheless accepts different types of sacrifice performed with various material elements, rituals and mantras and offered to the demigods under different names according to the interests and purposes of the performers.",
        "purport": " For material prosperity there are recommendations in the Vedas for various types of yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice). In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.10) it is confirmed that Lord Brahm\u0101 created all living entities, including human beings and demigods, and advised them to perform yaj\u00f1a according to their material desires (saha-yaj\u00f1\u0101\u1e25 praj\u0101\u1e25 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101). These performances are called yaj\u00f1as because their ultimate goal is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The purpose of performing yaj\u00f1as is to get material benefit, but because the aim is to simultaneously satisfy the Supreme Lord, such yaj\u00f1as have been recommended in the Vedas. Such performances are, of course, known as karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, or material activities, and all material activities are certainly contaminated by the three modes of material nature. Generally the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da ritualistic ceremonies are performed in the mode of passion, yet the conditioned souls, both human beings and demigods, are obliged to perform these yaj\u00f1as because without them one cannot be happy at all. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments that these karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da ritualistic ceremonies, although contaminated, contain touches of devotional service because whenever there is a performance of any yaj\u00f1a, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is given a central position. This is very important because even a little endeavor to please Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is bhakti and is of great value. A tinge of bhakti purifies the material nature of the performances, which by devotional service gradually come to the transcendental position. Therefore although such yaj\u00f1as are superficially material activities, the results are transcendental. Such yaj\u00f1as as S\u016brya-yaj\u00f1a, Indra-yaj\u00f1a and Candra-yaj\u00f1a are performed in the names of the demigods, but these demigods are bodily parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demigods cannot accept sacrificial offerings for themselves, but they can accept them for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as a departmental tax collector of a government cannot collect taxes for his personal account but can realize them for the government. Any yaj\u00f1a performed with this complete knowledge and understanding is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as brahm\u0101rpa\u1e47am, or a sacrifice offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since no one but the Supreme Lord can enjoy the results of sacrifice, the Lord says that He is the actual enjoyer of all sacrifices (bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram). Sacrifices should be performed with this view in mind. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.24): \u201cA person who is fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is sure to attain the spiritual kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities, in which the consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the same spiritual nature.\u201d The performer of sacrifices must always keep in view that the sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas are meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vi\u1e63\u1e47ur \u0101r\u0101dhyate panth\u0101\u1e25 (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 3.8.9). Anything material or spiritual done for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord is understood to be an actual yaj\u00f1a, and by performing such yaj\u00f1as one gets liberation from material bondage. The direct method of getting liberation from material bondage is devotional service, comprising the nine following methods: This ninefold process is described in this verse as vi\u015buddha-vij\u00f1\u0101na-ghana\u1e25, or satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly by transcendental knowledge concentrated on the form of the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This is the best method for satisfying the Supreme Lord. One who cannot take to this direct process, however, should take the indirect process of performing yaj\u00f1as for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Yaj\u00f1a. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is therefore called yaj\u00f1a-pati. \u015ariya\u1e25 pati\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-pati\u1e41 jagat-patim (Bh\u0101g. 2.9.15). The Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s deep scientific knowledge is concentrated to the supreme point. For example, medical science knows some things superficially, but doctors do not know exactly how things happen in the body. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, knows everything in detail. Therefore His knowledge is vij\u00f1\u0101na-ghana because it does not have any of the defects of material science. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is vi\u015buddha-vij\u00f1\u0101na-ghana, concentrated transcendental knowledge; therefore, even though He accepts karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bya materialistic yaj\u00f1as, He always remains in a transcendental position. Therefore, the mention of aneka-gu\u1e47a refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s many transcendental qualities, for He is not affected by the material qualities. The different kinds of material paraphernalia or physical elements are also gradually transformed into spiritual understanding because ultimately there is no difference between material and spiritual qualities, for everything emanates from the Supreme Spirit. This is realized by a gradual process of realization and purification. One vivid example of this is Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who took to meditation in the forest to achieve material benefit but ultimately became spiritually advanced and did not want any benediction for material profit. He was simply satisfied with the association of the Supreme Lord. \u0100\u015baya means \u201cdetermination.\u201d Generally a conditioned soul has the determination for material profit, but when these desires for material profit are satisfied through performance of yaj\u00f1a, one gradually achieves the spiritual platform. Then his life becomes perfect. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.3.10) therefore recommends: Everyone \u2014 whether ak\u0101ma (a devotee), sarva-k\u0101ma (a karm\u012b) or mok\u1e63a-k\u0101ma (a j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b or yog\u012b) \u2014 is encouraged to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the direct method of devotional service. In this way one can get both material and spiritual profit simultaneously."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is all-pervading, but He is also manifested in different types of bodies which arise from a combination of material nature, time, desires and occupational duties. Thus different types of consciousness develop, just as fire, which is always basically the same, blazes in different ways according to the shape and dimension of firewood.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly lives with the individual soul as Param\u0101tm\u0101. The individual soul has awareness in accord with his material body, which he attains by virtue of prak\u1e5bti, or material nature. The material ingredients are activated by the force of time, and thus the three material modes of nature are manifested. According to his association with the three modes of nature, the living entity develops a particular type of body. In animal life, the material mode of ignorance is so prominent that there is very little chance of realizing the Param\u0101tm\u0101, who is also present within the heart of the animal; but in the human form of life, because of developed consciousness (cetan\u0101m), one can be transferred from ignorance and passion to goodness by the results of his activities (kriy\u0101-phalatvena). A human being is therefore advised to associate with spiritually advanced personalities. The Vedas (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.2.12) give the direction tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet: in order to reach the perfection of life or to understand the real constitutional position of the living entity, one must approach the spiritual master. Gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet \u2014 one must; it is not optional. It is imperative that one approach the spiritual master, for by such association one proportionately develops his consciousness toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The highest perfection of such consciousness is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. According to the body given by prak\u1e5bti, or nature, one\u2019s consciousness is present; according to the development of consciousness, one\u2019s activities are performed; and according to the purity of such activities, one realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone\u2019s heart. The example given herein is very appropriate: fire is always the same, but according to the size of the fuel or burning wood, the fire appears to be straight, curved, small, big, etc. According to the development of consciousness, God realization is present. In the human form of life it is recommended, therefore, that one undergo the different types of penances and austerities described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga). Like a staircase, yoga has different steps for reaching the topmost floor, and according to one\u2019s position upon the staircase, he is understood to be situated in karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga or bhakti-yoga. Of course, bhakti-yoga is the topmost step on the staircase of realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, according to one\u2019s development in consciousness, one realizes his spiritual identity, and thus when one\u2019s existential position is purified fully, he becomes situated in brahm\u0101nanda, which is ultimately unlimited. Therefore the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement contributed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Lord Caitanya is the direct and easiest process for coming to the purest form of consciousness \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the platform on which the Supreme Personality is fully realized. Directions for performing different types of yaj\u00f1as are specifically arranged for the highest realization of the Supreme Lord, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the Lord Himself. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is realized according to the proportion of one\u2019s surrender: ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham (Bg. 4.11). Full surrender, however, occurs when a man is perfectly in knowledge: bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate (Bg. 7.19)."

By dint of all these spiritual assets, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are more powerful than royalty. It is therefore advised that the princely order not exhibit its material prowess before these two communities and should avoid offending them.",
        "purport": " P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja has explained in the previous verse the importance of devotional service for both the rulers and the citizens of the state. Now he explains how one can be steadily fixed in devotional service. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, while instructing \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, has compared the devotional service of the Lord with a creeper. A creeper has a feeble stem and requires the support of a tree to grow, and while growing it requires sufficient protection so that it may not be lost. While describing the system of protection for the creeper of devotional service, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has especially stressed protection from offenses unto the lotus feet of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Such offenses are called vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dha. Apar\u0101dha means \u201coffense.\u201d If one commits vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dhas, all of his progress in devotional service will be checked. Even though one is very much advanced in devotional service, if he commits offenses at the feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, his advancement is all spoiled. In the \u015b\u0101stras it is found that a very great yog\u012b, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, committed a vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dha and thus for one full year had to travel all over the universe, even to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, to defend himself from the offense. At last, even when he approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, he was refused protection. Therefore one should be very careful about committing offenses at the feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. The most grievous type of vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dha is called gurv-apar\u0101dha, which refers to offenses at the lotus feet of the spiritual master. In the chanting of the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this gurv-apar\u0101dha is considered the most grievous offense. Guror avaj\u00f1\u0101 \u015bruti-\u015b\u0101stra-nindanam (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a). Among the ten offenses committed against the chanting of the holy name, the first offenses are disobedience of the spiritual master and blasphemy of the Vedic literature. The simple definition of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is given by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: a person who immediately reminds one of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. In this verse, both Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and br\u0101hma\u1e47as are mentioned. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is a learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a and is therefore designated as br\u0101hma\u1e47a-vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, br\u0101hma\u1e47a-pa\u1e47\u1e0dita or as a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and br\u0101hma\u1e47a. In other words, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is supposed to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a already, but a br\u0101hma\u1e47a may not be a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. When a person understands his pure identity, brahma-j\u0101n\u0101ti, he immediately becomes a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. In the br\u0101hma\u1e47a stage, one\u2019s understanding of the Absolute Truth is mainly based on the impersonal view. When a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, however, rises to the platform of personal understanding of the Supreme Godhead, he becomes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is transcendental even to a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. In the material conception, the position of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is the highest in human society, but a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is transcendental even to a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Both the br\u0101hma\u1e47a and Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava are spiritually advanced. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s qualifications are mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as truthfulness, mental equanimity, control of the senses, the power of tolerance, simplicity, knowledge of the Absolute Truth, firm faith in the scriptures, and practical application of the brahminical qualities in life. In addition to all these qualifications, when one fully engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he becomes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja warns his citizens who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Lord to take care against offenses to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Offenses at their lotus feet are so destructive that even the descendants of Yadu who were born in the family of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were destroyed due to offenses at their feet. The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot tolerate any offense at the lotus feet of br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Sometimes, due to their powerful positions, princes or government servants neglect the position of br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, not knowing that because of their offense they will be ruined."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ancient, eternal Godhead, who is foremost amongst all great personalities, obtained the opulence of His staunch reputation, which purifies the entire universe, by worshiping the lotus feet of those br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Person is described herein as brahma\u1e47ya-deva. Brahma\u1e47ya refers to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas or the brahminical culture, and deva means \u201cworshipable Lord.\u201d Therefore unless one is on the transcendental platform of being a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava or on the highest platform of material goodness (as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a), he cannot appreciate the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the lower stages of ignorance and passion, it is difficult to appreciate or understand the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Lord is described herein as the worshipable Deity for persons in brahminical and Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava culture: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the prime protector of brahminical culture and the cow. Without knowing and respecting these, one cannot realize the science of God, and without this knowledge, any welfare activities or humanitarian propaganda cannot be successful. The Lord is puru\u1e63a, or the supreme enjoyer. Not only is He the enjoyer when He appears as a manifested incarnation, but He is the enjoyer since time immemorial, from the very beginning (pur\u0101tana\u1e25), and eternally (nityam). Yac-cara\u1e47\u0101bhivandan\u0101t: P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead attained this opulence of eternal fame simply by worshiping the lotus feet of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that the Lord does not need to work to achieve material gain. Since He is perpetually supremely perfect, He does not need to obtain anything, but still it is said that He obtained His opulences by worshiping the lotus feet of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. These are His exemplary actions. When Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, He offered His respects by bowing down at the lotus feet of N\u0101rada. When Sud\u0101m\u0101 Vipra came to His house, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally washed his feet and gave him a seat on His personal bed. Although He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a offered His respects to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and Kunt\u012b. The Lord\u2019s exemplary behavior is to teach us. We should learn from His personal behavior how to give protection to the cow, how to cultivate brahminical qualities and how to respect the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.21), yad yad \u0101carati \u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dhas tat tad evetaro jana\u1e25: \u201cIf the leading personalities behave in a certain manner, others follow them automatically.\u201d Who can be more of a leading personality than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and whose behavior could be more exemplary? It is not that He needed to do all these things to acquire material gain, but all of these acts were performed just to teach us how to behave in this material world. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described herein as mahattama-agra\u1e47\u012b\u1e25. Within this material world, the mahattamas, or great personalities, are Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, but He is above them all. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 paro \u2019vyakt\u0101t: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in a transcendental position, above everything created within this material world. His opulence, His riches, His beauty, His wisdom, His knowledge, His renunciation and His reputation are all jagat-pavitram, universally purifying. The more we discuss His opulences, the more the universe becomes purer and purer. In the material world, the opulences possessed by a material person are never fixed. Today one may be a very rich man, but tomorrow he may become poor; today one is very famous, but tomorrow he may be infamous. Materially obtained opulences are never fixed, but all six opulences perpetually exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not only in the spiritual world, but also in this material world. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s reputation is fixed, and His book of wisdom, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is still honored. Everything pertaining to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally existing."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.65) it is said, pras\u0101de sarva-du\u1e25kh\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u0101nir asyopaj\u0101yate. Unless one is self-satisfied, he cannot be free from the miserable conditions of material existence. Therefore it is essential to render service to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas to achieve the perfection of self-satisfaction. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore says: \u201cBirth after birth I desire to serve the lotus feet of the \u0101c\u0101ryas and live in a society of devotees.\u201d A spiritual atmosphere can be maintained only by living in a society of devotees and by serving the orders of the \u0101c\u0101ryas. The spiritual master is the best br\u0101hma\u1e47a. At present, in the Age of Kali, it is very difficult to render service to the br\u0101hma\u1e47a-kula, or the br\u0101hma\u1e47a class. The difficulty, according to the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a, is that demons, taking advantage of Kali-yuga, have taken birth in br\u0101hma\u1e47a families. R\u0101k\u1e63as\u0101\u1e25 kalim \u0101\u015britya j\u0101yante brahma-yoni\u1e63u (Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a). In other words, in this age there are many so-called caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as and caste gosv\u0101m\u012bs who, taking advantage of the \u015b\u0101stra and of the innocence of people in general, claim to be br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas by hereditary right. One will not derive any benefit by rendering service to such false br\u0101hma\u1e47a-kulas. One must therefore take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and his associates and should also render service to them, for such activity will greatly help the neophyte in attaining full satisfaction. This has been very clearly explained by \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura in his explanation of the verse vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101 buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana (Bg. 2.41). By actually following the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga as recommended by \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, one can very quickly come to the transcendental platform of liberation, as explained in this verse (atyanta-\u015bamam). The particular use of the word anativelam, \u201cwithout delay,\u201d is very significant because simply by serving br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas one can get liberation. There is no need to undergo severe penances and austerities. The vivid example of this is N\u0101rada Muni himself. In his previous birth, he was simply a maidservant\u2019s son, but he got the opportunity to serve exalted br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, and thus in his next life he not only became liberated, but became famous as the supreme spiritual master of the entire Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava disciplic succession. According to the Vedic system, therefore, it is customarily recommended that after performing a ritualistic ceremony one should feed the br\u0101hma\u1e47as."

        "translation": "Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Ananta, eats through the fire sacrifices offered in the names of the different demigods, He does not take as much pleasure in eating through fire as He does in accepting offerings through the mouths of learned sages and devotees, for then He does not leave the association of devotees.",
        "purport": " According to Vedic injunctions, a fire sacrifice is held in order to give food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the names of the different demigods. While performing a fire sacrifice, one pronounces the word sv\u0101h\u0101 in mantras such as indr\u0101ya sv\u0101h\u0101 and \u0101dity\u0101ya sv\u0101h\u0101. These mantras are uttered to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead through demigods such as Indra and \u0100ditya, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead says: \u201cI am not in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha nor in the hearts of the yog\u012bs. I remain where My devotees engage in glorifying My activities.\u201d It is to be understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not leave the company of His devotees. Fire is certainly devoid of life, but devotees and br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the living representatives of the Supreme Lord. Therefore to feed br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas is to feed the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly. It may be concluded that instead of offering fire sacrifices, one should offer foodstuffs to br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, for that process is more effective than fire yaj\u00f1a. The vivid example of this principle in action was given by Advaita Prabhu. When He performed the \u015br\u0101ddha ceremony for His father, He first of all called Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura and offered him food. It is the practice that after finishing the \u015br\u0101ddha ceremony one should offer food to an elevated br\u0101hma\u1e47a. But Advaita Prabhu offered food first to Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, who had taken his birth in a Muhammadan family. Therefore Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura asked Advaita Prabhu why He was doing something which might jeopardize His position in br\u0101hma\u1e47a society. Advaita Prabhu replied that He was feeding millions of first-class br\u0101hma\u1e47as by offering the food to Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura. He was prepared to talk with any learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a on this point and prove definitely that by offering food to a pure devotee like Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, He was equally as blessed as He would have been by offering food to thousands of learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as. When performing sacrifices, one offers oblations to the sacrificial fire, but when such oblations are offered to Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, they are certainly more effective."

        "translation": "In brahminical culture a br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental position is eternally maintained because the injunctions of the Vedas are accepted with faith, austerity, scriptural conclusions, full sense and mind control, and meditation. In this way the real goal of life is illuminated, just as one\u2019s face is fully reflected in a clear mirror.",
        "purport": " Since it is described in the previous verse that feeding a living br\u0101hma\u1e47a is more effective than offering oblations in a fire sacrifice, in this verse it is now clearly described what br\u0101hma\u1e47ism is and who a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is. In the Age of Kali, taking advantage of the fact that by feeding a br\u0101hma\u1e47a one obtains a more effective result than by performing sacrifices, a class of men with no brahminical qualifications claim the eating privilege known as br\u0101hma\u1e47a-bhojana simply on the basis of their birth in br\u0101hma\u1e47a families. In order to distinguish this class of men from the real br\u0101hma\u1e47as, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu is giving an exact description of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and brahminical culture. One should not take advantage of his position simply to live like a fire without light. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a must be fully conversant with the Vedic conclusion, which is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25 (Bg. 15.15). The Vedic conclusion \u2014 the ultimate understanding, or Ved\u0101nta understanding \u2014 is knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Actually that is a fact because simply by understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is, as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (janma karma ca me divyam eva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25), one becomes a perfect br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a who knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a perfectly well is always in a transcendental position. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service and who does not fall down in any circumstance at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d Therefore a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually a perfect br\u0101hma\u1e47a. His situation is transcendental, for he is free from the four defects of conditional life, which are the tendencies to commit mistakes, to be illusioned, to cheat and to possess imperfect senses. A perfect Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, is always in this transcendental position because he speaks according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His representative. Because Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas speak exactly according to the tune of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whatever they say is free from these four defects. For example, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that everyone should always think of Him, everyone should become His devotee, offer Him obeisances and worship Him, and ultimately everyone should surrender unto Him. These devotional activities are transcendental and free from mistakes, illusion, cheating and imperfection. Therefore anyone who is a sincere devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who preaches this cult, speaking only on the basis of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions, is understood to be virajam, or free from the defects of material contamination. A genuine br\u0101hma\u1e47a or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava therefore depends eternally on the conclusion of the Vedas or Vedic versions presented by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Only from Vedic knowledge can we understand the actual position of the Absolute Truth, who, as described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, is manifested in three features \u2014 namely impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and, at last, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This knowledge is perfect from time immemorial, and the brahminical or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava culture depends on this principle eternally. One should therefore study the Vedas with faith, not only for one\u2019s personal knowledge, but for the sake of spreading this knowledge and these activities through real faith in the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Vedas. In this verse the word ma\u1e45gala, \u201causpicious,\u201d is very significant. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b quotes that to do what is good and to reject what is not good is called ma\u1e45gala, or auspicious. To do what is good means to accept everything favorable to the discharge of devotional service, and to reject what is not good means to reject everything not favorable for discharging devotional service. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, we accept this principle by rejecting four prohibited items \u2014 namely illicit sex life, intoxication, gambling and flesh-eating \u2014 and accepting the daily chanting of at least sixteen rounds of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra and meditation three times a day by chanting the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra. In this way one can keep his brahminical culture and spiritual strength intact. By following these principles of devotional service strictly, chanting twenty-four hours a day the mah\u0101-mantra \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 one makes positive progress in spiritual life and ultimately becomes completely fit to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. Because the ultimate goal of studying or understanding the Vedic knowledge is to find K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one who follows the Vedic principles as described above can from the very beginning see all the features of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Absolute Truth, very distinctly, as one can see one\u2019s own face completely reflected in a clear mirror. The conclusion is, therefore, that a br\u0101hma\u1e47a does not become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a simply because he is a living entity or is born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family; he must possess all the qualities mentioned in the \u015b\u0101stras and practice the brahminical principles in his life. Thus he ultimately becomes a fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person and can understand what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. How a devotee continuously sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a face to face within his heart is described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38) as follows: The devotee, by development of pure love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, constantly sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is known as \u015ay\u0101masundara, within his heart. That is the perfectional stage of brahminical culture."

A great soul who has fully surrendered to the Supreme Lord after understanding Him fully and after repeatedly undergoing austerities and penances for many, many lives is very rare. The crown of a king is simply a big load if the king or head of the state does not actually bear the dust of the lotus feet of br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas.

        "translation": "Whoever acquires the brahminical qualifications \u2014 whose only wealth is good behavior, who is grateful, and who takes shelter of experienced persons \u2014 gets all the opulence of the world. I therefore wish that the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His associates be pleased with the br\u0101hma\u1e47a class, with the cows and with me.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped with the prayer namo brahma\u1e47ya-dev\u0101ya go-br\u0101hma\u1e47a-hit\u0101ya ca. Thus it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead respects and protects the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and brahminical culture, as well as the cows; in other words, wherever there are br\u0101hma\u1e47as and brahminical culture, there are cows and cow protection. In a society or civilization in which there are no br\u0101hma\u1e47as or brahminical culture, cows are treated as ordinary animals and slaughtered, at the sacrifice of human civilization. The specific mention of the word gav\u0101m by P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is significant because the Lord is always associated with cows and His devotees. In pictures Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always seen with cows and His associates such as the cowherd boys and the gop\u012bs. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot be alone. Therefore P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said, s\u0101nucara\u015b ca, indicating that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always associated with His followers and devotees. A devotee acquires all the good qualities of the demigods; he is gu\u1e47\u0101yanam, the reservoir of all good qualities. His only asset is good behavior, and he is grateful. Gratitude for the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is one of the qualities of br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Everyone should feel grateful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He is maintaining all living entities and supplying all their necessities. As stated in the Vedas (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13), eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n: the supreme one is supplying all necessities to the living entities. The living entity who is therefore grateful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly qualified with good characteristics. The word v\u1e5bddh\u0101\u015brayam is very significant in this verse. V\u1e5bddha refers to one who is advanced in knowledge. There are two kinds of old men: those who are advanced in years and those who are experienced in knowledge. One who is advanced in knowledge is actually v\u1e5bddha (j\u00f1\u0101na-v\u1e5bddha); one does not become v\u1e5bddha simply by advancing in age. V\u1e5bddh\u0101\u015brayam, a person who takes shelter of a superior person who is advanced in knowledge, can acquire all the good qualities of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and be trained in good behavior. When one actually attains good qualities, becomes grateful for the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and takes shelter of a bona fide spiritual master, he is endowed with all opulence. Such a person is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Therefore P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja invokes the blessings and mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with His associates, devotees, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, br\u0101hma\u1e47as and cows."

The purpose of accepting a wife in religious marriage, as sanctioned in the Vedas, is to have a putra, a son qualified to deliver his father from the darkest region of hellish life. Marriage is not intended for sense gratification but for getting a son fully qualified to deliver his father.

The rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in expectation of a good reward is deprecated by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja as mercantile business. Because Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he did not ask a benediction for his personal self but was very affectionate toward his father. Although his father tortured him and would have killed him had he himself not been killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja begged pardon for him from the Lord. This favor was immediately granted by the Lord, and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was delivered from the darkest region of hellish life, and he returned back home, back to Godhead, by the grace of his son. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is the topmost example of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, who is always compassionate toward sinful persons suffering a hellish life within this material world.

Like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, all pure devotees of the Lord come to this material world with full compassion to deliver the sinful. They undergo all kinds of tribulations, suffering them with tolerance, because that is another qualification of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, who tries to deliver all sinful persons from the hellish conditions of material existence. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are therefore offered the following prayer: The chief concern of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is to deliver the fallen souls."

The br\u0101hma\u1e47as should live by spreading knowledge and should therefore take contributions from their disciples, whereas a king should give protection to the citizens for their development to the highest standard of life, and he can therefore levy taxes from them; businessmen or mercantile men, because they produce foodstuffs for the whole of society, can take a little profit from this, whereas the \u015b\u016bdras, who cannot work as either br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas or vai\u015byas, should give service to the higher classes of society and be provided by them with a supply of the necessities of life. The symptom of a qualified king or political leader is mentioned herein: he must be very merciful and compassionate to the people and see to their prime interest, which is to become elevated devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Great souls are naturally inclined to do good to others, and a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava especially is the most compassionate and merciful personality in society. Therefore we offer our respects to a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava leader as follows: Only a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava leader can fulfill all the desires of the people (v\u0101\u00f1ch\u0101-kalpataru), and he is compassionate because he is the contributor of the greatest benefit to human society. He is patita-p\u0101vana, the deliverer of all fallen souls, because if the king or the head of the government follows in the footsteps of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, who are naturally leaders in missionary work, the vai\u015byas will also follow in the footsteps of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and the \u015b\u016bdras will give them service.

        "purport": " Without the spread of brahminical culture and without proper protection from the government, no social standard can be maintained properly. This is admitted in this verse by the citizens of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, who could maintain the wonderful situation of his government due to his position in pure goodness. The word viv\u1e5bddha-sattv\u0101ya is significant. In the material world there are three qualities, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. One has to be raised from the platform of ignorance to the platform of goodness by devotional service. There is no other means for elevating one from the lowest stage of life to the highest stage but the execution of devotional service; as advised in the previous chapters of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, one can raise himself from the lowest position to the highest simply by associating with devotees and hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam regularly from their mouths: \u201cWhen one engages in devotional service in the first stages of hearing and chanting, the Lord, who is in everyone\u2019s heart, helps the devotee in cleansing his heart.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.17) In the gradual cleansing process, one is relieved of the influence of passion and ignorance and is situated on the platform of goodness. The result of association with the qualities of passion and ignorance is that one becomes lusty and greedy. But when one is elevated to the platform of goodness, he is satisfied in any condition of life and is without lust and greed. This mentality indicates one\u2019s situation on the platform of goodness. One has to transcend this goodness and raise himself to the pure goodness called viv\u1e5bddha-sattva, or the advanced stage of goodness. In the advanced stage of goodness one can become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu is addressed here as viv\u1e5bddha-sattva, or one who is situated in the transcendental position. But Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, although situated in the transcendental position of a pure devotee, came down to the position of br\u0101hma\u1e47a and k\u1e63atriya for the benefit of human society and thus gave protection to the entire world by his personal prowess. Although he was a king, a k\u1e63atriya, because he was a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava he was also a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. As a br\u0101hma\u1e47a he could give proper instruction to the citizens, and as a k\u1e63atriya he could rightly give protection to all of them. Thus the citizens of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu were protected in all respects by the perfect king."
