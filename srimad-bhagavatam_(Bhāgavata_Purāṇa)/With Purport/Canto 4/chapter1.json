By his grace we have finished three cantos already, and we are just trying to begin the Fourth Canto. By his divine grace let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Lord Caitanya, who began this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement of Bh\u0101gavata-dharma five hundred years ago, and through His grace let us offer our obeisances to the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, and then let us offer our obeisances to R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the spiritual couple who enjoy eternally in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana with Their cowherd boys and damsels in Vrajabh\u016bmi. Let us also offer our respectful obeisances to all the devotees and eternal servitors of the Supreme Lord. In this Fourth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam there are thirty-one chapters, and all these chapters describe the secondary creation by Brahm\u0101 and the Manus. The Supreme Lord Himself does the real creation by agitating His material energy, and then, by His order, Brahm\u0101, the first living creature in the universe, attempts to create the different planetary systems and their inhabitants, expanding the population through his progeny, like Manu and other progenitors of living entities, who work perpetually under the order of the Supreme Lord. In the First Chapter of this Fourth Canto there are descriptions of the three daughters of Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu and their descendants. The next six chapters describe the sacrifice performed by King Dak\u1e63a and how it was spoiled. Thereafter the activities of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva are described in five chapters. Then, in eleven chapters, the activities of King P\u1e5bthu are described, and the next eight chapters are devoted to the activities of the Pracet\u0101 kings. As described in the first verse of this chapter, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu had three daughters, named \u0100k\u016bti, Devah\u016bti and Pras\u016bti. Of these three daughters, one daughter, Devah\u016bti, has already been described, along with her husband, Kardama Muni, and her son, Kapila Muni. In this chapter the descendants of the first daughter, \u0100k\u016bti, will specifically be described. Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu was the son of Brahm\u0101. Brahm\u0101 had many other sons, but Manu\u2019s name is specifically mentioned first because he was a great devotee of the Lord. In this verse there is also the word ca, indicating that besides the three daughters mentioned, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu also had two sons."

        "purport": " Sometimes a sonless person offers his daughter to a husband on the condition that his grandson be returned to him to be adopted as his son and inherit his property. This is called putrik\u0101-dharma, which means that by execution of religious rituals one gets a son, although one is sonless by one\u2019s own wife. But here we see extraordinary behavior in Manu, for in spite of his having two sons, he handed over his first daughter to Praj\u0101pati Ruci on the condition that the son born of his daughter be returned to him as his son. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments in this connection that King Manu knew that the Supreme Personality of Godhead would take birth in the womb of \u0100k\u016bti; therefore, in spite of having two sons, he wanted the particular son born of \u0100k\u016bti because he was ambitious to have the Supreme Personality of Godhead appear as his son and grandson. Manu is the lawgiver of mankind, and since he personally executed the putrik\u0101-dharma, we may accept that such a system may be adopted by mankind also. Thus, even though one has a son, if one wants to have a particular son from one\u2019s daughter, one may give one\u2019s daughter in charity on that condition. That is the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b."

        "purport": " The word brahma-varcasv\u012b is very significant. Ruci was a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and he executed the brahminical duties very rigidly. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the brahminical qualifications are control of the senses, control of the mind, cleanliness within and without, development of spiritual and material knowledge, simplicity, truthfulness, faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, etc. There are many qualities which indicate a brahminical personality, and it is understood that Ruci followed all the brahminical principles rigidly. Therefore he is specifically mentioned as brahma-varcasv\u012b. One who is born of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a father but does not act as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is called, in Vedic language, a brahma-bandhu, and is calculated to be on the level of \u015b\u016bdras and women. Thus in the Bh\u0101gavatam we find that Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was specifically compiled by Vy\u0101sadeva for str\u012b-\u015b\u016bdra-brahma-bandhu. Str\u012b means women, \u015b\u016bdra means the lower class of civilized human society, and brahma-bandhu means persons who are born in the families of br\u0101hma\u1e47as but do not follow the rules and regulations carefully. All of these three classes are called less intelligent; they have no access to the study of the Vedas, which are specifically meant for persons who have acquired the brahminical qualifications. This restriction is based not upon any sectarian distinction but upon qualification. The Vedic literatures cannot be understood unless one has developed the brahminical qualifications. It is regrettable, therefore, that persons who have no brahminical qualifications and have never been trained under a bona fide spiritual master nevertheless comment on Vedic literatures like the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and other Pur\u0101\u1e47as, for such persons cannot deliver their real message. Ruci was considered a first-class br\u0101hma\u1e47a; therefore he is mentioned here as brahma-varcasv\u012b, one who had full prowess in brahminical strength."

Therefore it is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9), yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47a\u1e25: one should act, but one should perform one\u2019s prescribed duties only for the sake of Yaj\u00f1a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. lf one does not act for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or if one does not perform devotional service, then there will be reactions to all one\u2019s activities. It does not matter if the reaction is good or bad; if our activities are not dovetailed with the desire of the Supreme Lord, or if we do not act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then we shall be responsible for the results of all our activities. There is always a reaction to every kind of action, but if actions are performed for Yaj\u00f1a, there is no reaction. Thus if one acts for Yaj\u00f1a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is not entangled in the material condition, for it is mentioned in the Vedas and also in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the Vedas and the Vedic rituals are all meant for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. From the very beginning one should try to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; that will free one from the reactions of material activities."

        "purport": " An ideal husband and wife are generally called Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a to compare them to the Lord and the goddess of fortune, for it is significant that Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a are forever happy as husband and wife. A wife should always remain satisfied with her husband, and a husband should always remain satisfied with his wife. In the C\u0101\u1e47akya-\u015bloka, the moral instructions of C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, it is said that if a husband and wife are always satisfied with one another, then the goddess of fortune automatically comes. In other words, where there is no disagreement between husband and wife, all material opulence is present, and good children are born. Generally, according to Vedic civilization, the wife is trained to be satisfied in all conditions, and the husband, according to Vedic instruction, is required to please the wife with sufficient food, ornaments and clothing. Then, if they are satisfied with their mutual dealings, good children are born. In this way the entire world can become peaceful, but unfortunately in this Age of Kali there are no ideal husbands and wives; therefore unwanted children are produced, and there is no peace and prosperity in the present-day world."

Soma was a partial representation of Lord Brahm\u0101, Datt\u0101treya was a partial representation of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and Durv\u0101s\u0101 was a partial representation of Lord \u015aiva.",
        "purport": " In this verse we find the words \u0101tma-\u012b\u015ba-brahma-sambhav\u0101n. \u0100tma means the Supersoul, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, \u012b\u015ba means Lord \u015aiva, and brahma means the four-headed Lord Brahm\u0101. The three sons born of Anas\u016by\u0101 \u2014 Datt\u0101treya, Durv\u0101s\u0101 and Soma \u2014 were born as partial representations of these three demigods. \u0100tma is not in the category of the demigods or living entities because He is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; therefore He is described as vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m. The Supersoul, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is the seed-giving father of all living entities, including Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. Another meaning of the word \u0101tma may be accepted in this way: the principle who is the Supersoul in every \u0101tm\u0101 \u2014 or, one may say, the soul of everyone \u2014 became manifested as Datt\u0101treya, because the word a\u1e41\u015ba, \u201cpart and parcel,\u201d is used here. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the individual souls are also described as parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or Supersoul, so why not accept that Datt\u0101treya was one of those parts? Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 are also described here as parts, so why not accept all of them as ordinary individual souls? The answer is that the manifestations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and those of the ordinary living entities are certainly all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and no one is equal to Him, but among the parts and parcels there are different categories. In the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is nicely explained that some of the parts are sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba and some are vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba. Vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba parts are called j\u012bvas, and sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba parts are in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u category. In the j\u012bva category, the vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba parts and parcels, there are also gradations. That is explained in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, where it is clearly stated that the individual parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord are subject to being covered by the external energy, called illusion, or m\u0101y\u0101. Such individual parts and parcels, who can travel to any part of the Lord\u2019s creation, are called sarva-gata and are suffering the pangs of material existence. They are proportionately freed from the coverings of ignorance under material existence according to different levels of work and under different influences of the modes of material nature. For example, the sufferings of j\u012bvas situated in the mode of goodness are less than those of j\u012bvas situated in the mode of ignorance. Pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is the birthright of all living entities because every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The consciousness of the Lord is also in the part and parcel, and according to the proportion to which that consciousness is cleared of material dirt, the living entities are differently situated. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, the living entities of different gradations are compared to candles or lamps with different candlepower. For example, some electric bulbs have the power of one thousand candles, some have the power of five hundred candles, some the power of one hundred candles, some fifty candles, etc., but all electric bulbs have light. Light is present in every bulb, but the gradations of light are different. Similarly, there are gradations of Brahman. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47u sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba expansions of the Supreme Lord in different Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms are like lamps, Lord \u015aiva is also like a lamp, and the supreme candlepower, or the one-hundred-percent light, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva has ninety-four percent, the \u015biva-tattva has eighty-four percent, Lord Brahm\u0101 has seventy-eight percent, and the living entities are also like Brahm\u0101, but in the conditioned state their power is still more dim. There are gradations of Brahman, and no one can deny this fact. Therefore the words \u0101tme\u015ba-brahma-sambhav\u0101n indicate that Datt\u0101treya was directly part and parcel of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, whereas Durv\u0101s\u0101 and Soma were parts and parcels of Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101."

Of course, he must have been conversant with the Vedic information that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead who is the creator of the universe, from whom everything emanated, who maintains this created manifestation, and in whom the entire manifestation is conserved after dissolution. Yato v\u0101 im\u0101ni bh\u016bt\u0101ni (Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad 3.1.1). The Vedic mantras give us information of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so Atri Muni concentrated his mind upon that Supreme Personality of Godhead, even without knowing His name, just to beg from Him a child exactly on His level. This kind of devotional service, in which knowledge of God\u2019s name is lacking, is also described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 where the Lord says that four kinds of men with backgrounds of pious activities come to Him asking for what they need. Atri Muni wanted a son exactly like the Lord, and therefore he is not supposed to have been a pure devotee, because he had a desire to be fulfilled, and that desire was material. Although he wanted a son exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this desire was material because he did not want the Personality of Godhead Himself, but only a child exactly like Him. If he had desired the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his child, he would have been completely free of material desires because he would have wanted the Supreme Absolute Truth, but because he wanted a similar child, his desire was material. Thus Atri Muni cannot be counted among the pure devotees."

The Lord must exist before the creation; otherwise how could He be its Lord? If someone constructs a big building, this indicates that he must have existed before the building was constructed. Therefore the Supreme Lord, the creator of the universe, must be transcendental to the material modes of nature. But it is known that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u takes charge of the mode of goodness, Brahm\u0101 takes charge of the mode of passion, and Lord \u015aiva takes charge of the mode of ignorance. Therefore Atri Muni said, \u201cThat jagad-\u012b\u015bvara, the Lord of the universe, must be one of you, but since three of you have appeared, I cannot recognize whom I have called. You are all so kind. Please let me know who is actually jagad-\u012b\u015bvara, the Lord of the universe.\u201d In fact, Atri \u1e5a\u1e63i was doubtful about the constitutional position of the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but he was quite certain that the Lord of the universe cannot be one of the creatures created by m\u0101y\u0101. His very inquiry about whom he had called indicates that he was in doubt about the constitutional position of the Lord. Therefore he prayed to all three, \u201cKindly let me know who is the transcendental Lord of the universe.\u201d He was certain, of course, that not all of them could be the Lord but that the Lord of the universe was one of the three."

        "translation": "The three deities told Atri Muni: Dear br\u0101hma\u1e47a, you are perfect in your determination, and therefore as you have decided, so it will happen; it will not happen otherwise. We are all the same person upon whom you were meditating, and therefore we have all come to you.",
        "purport": " Atri Muni unspecifically thought of the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of the universe, although he had no clear idea of the Lord of the universe nor of His specific form. Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, from whose breathing millions of universes emanate and into whom they are again withdrawn, may be accepted as the Lord of the universe. Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, from whose abdomen sprouted the lotus flower which is the birthplace of Brahm\u0101, may also be considered the Lord of the universe. Similarly, K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is the Supersoul of all living entities, may also be considered the Lord of the universe. Then, under the order of K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form within this universe, Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva may also be accepted as the Lords of the universe. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Lord of the universe because He is its maintainer. Similarly, Brahm\u0101 creates the different planetary systems and the population, so he also may be considered the Lord of the universe. Or Lord \u015aiva, who is ultimately the destroyer of the universe, also may be considered its Lord. Therefore, since Atri Muni did not specifically mention whom he wanted, all three \u2014 Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Lord \u015aiva \u2014 came before him. They said, \u201cSince you were thinking of having a son exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord of the universe, your determination will be fulfilled.\u201d In other words, one\u2019s determination is fulfilled according to the strength of one\u2019s devotion. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25): y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n pit\u1e5dn y\u0101nti pit\u1e5b-vrat\u0101\u1e25. If one is attached to a particular demigod, one is promoted to the abode of that demigod; if one is attached to the Pit\u0101s, or forefathers, one is promoted to their planet; and similarly if one is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is promoted to the abode of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Atri Muni had no clear conception of the Lord of the universe; therefore the three presiding deities who are actually the lords of the universe in the three departments of the modes of nature all came before him. Now, according to the strength of his determination for a son, his desire would be fulfilled by the grace of the Lord."

In space there are innumerable varieties of planets and also the air, and in the air there are variously colored clouds, and sometimes we see airplanes running from one place to another. Thus the entire cosmic manifestation is full of variety, but actually that variety is a manifestation of the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and that energy is situated in Him. Now the Lord Himself, after manifesting His energy, appeared within the creation of His energy, which is simultaneously one with and different from Himself, and therefore the demigods offered their respects to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who manifests Himself in such varieties. There are some philosophers, called nondualists, who because of their impersonal conception think that varieties are false. In this verse it is specifically stated, yo m\u0101yay\u0101 viracitam. This indicates that the varieties are a manifestation of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus because the energy is nondifferent from the Godhead, the varieties are also factual. The material varieties may be temporary, but they are not false. They are a reflection of the spiritual varieties. Here the word praticak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101ya, \u201cthere are varieties,\u201d announces the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u1e5a\u1e63i and who is the origin of all varieties of material nature."
