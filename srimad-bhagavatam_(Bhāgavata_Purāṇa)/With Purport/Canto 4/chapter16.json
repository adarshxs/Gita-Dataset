Although Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was simply enthroned on the royal seat and was not at that time exhibiting his godly powers, the reciters like the s\u016bta, the m\u0101gadha and the vand\u012b understood that King P\u1e5bthu was an incarnation of God. They could understand this by the instructions given by the great sages and learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as. We have to understand the incarnations of God by the instructions of authorized persons. We cannot manufacture a God by our own concoctions. As stated by Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, s\u0101dhu-\u015b\u0101stra-guru: one has to test all spiritual matters according to the instructions of saintly persons, scriptures and the spiritual master. The spiritual master is one who follows the instructions of his predecessors, namely the s\u0101dhus, or saintly persons. A bona fide spiritual master does not mention anything not mentioned in the authorized scriptures. Ordinary people have to follow the instructions of s\u0101dhu, \u015b\u0101stra and guru. Those statements made in the \u015b\u0101stras and those made by the bona fide s\u0101dhu or guru cannot differ from one another. Reciters like the s\u016bta and the m\u0101gadha were confidentially aware that King P\u1e5bthu was an incarnation of the Personality of Godhead. Although the King denied such praise because he was not at that time exhibiting his godly qualities, the reciters did not stop praising him. Rather, they were very pleased with the King, who, although actually an incarnation of God, was so humble and delightful in his dealings with devotees. In this connection we may note that previously (4.15.21) it was mentioned that King P\u1e5bthu was smiling and was in a pleasant mood while speaking to the reciters. Thus we have to learn from the Lord or His incarnation how to become gentle and humble. The King\u2019s behavior was very pleasing to the reciters, and consequently the reciters continued their praise and even foretold the King\u2019s future activities, as they had been instructed by the s\u0101dhus and sages."

        "translation": "The reciters continued: Dear King, you are a direct incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and by His causeless mercy you have descended to this earth. Therefore it is not possible for us to actually glorify your exalted activities. Although you have appeared through the body of King Vena, even great orators and speakers like Lord Brahm\u0101 and other demigods cannot exactly describe the glorious activities of Your Lordship.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word m\u0101yay\u0101 means \u201cby your causeless mercy.\u201d The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers explain the word m\u0101y\u0101 as meaning \u201cillusion\u201d or \u201cfalseness.\u201d However, there is another meaning of m\u0101y\u0101 \u2014 that is, \u201ccauseless mercy.\u201d There are two kinds of m\u0101y\u0101: yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 and mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101. Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 is an expansion of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, and both these m\u0101y\u0101s are different expressions of the Lord\u2019s internal potencies. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord appears through His internal potencies (\u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101). We should therefore reject the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da explanation that the Lord appears in a body given by the external potency, the material energy. The Lord and His incarnation are fully independent and can appear anywhere and everywhere by virtue of the internal potency. Although born out of the so-called dead body of King Vena, King P\u1e5bthu was still an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the Lord\u2019s internal potency. The Lord can appear in any family. Sometimes He appears as a fish incarnation (matsya-avat\u0101ra) or a boar incarnation (var\u0101ha-avat\u0101ra). Thus the Lord is completely free and independent to appear anywhere and everywhere by His internal potency. It is stated that Ananta, an incarnation of the Lord who has unlimited mouths, cannot reach the end of His glorification of the Lord, although Ananta has been describing the Lord since time immemorial. So what to speak of demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and others? It is said that the Lord is \u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam \u2014 always worshiped by demigods like Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. If the demigods cannot find adequate language to express the glories of the Lord, then what to speak of others? Consequently reciters like the s\u016bta and m\u0101gadha felt inadequate to speak about King P\u1e5bthu. By glorifying the Lord with exalted verses, one becomes purified. Although we are unable to offer prayers to the Lord in an adequate fashion, our duty is to make the attempt in order to purify ourselves. It is not that we should stop our glorification because demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva cannot adequately glorify the Lord. Rather, as stated by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, everyone should glorify the Lord according to his own ability. If we are serious and sincere devotees, the Lord will give us the intelligence to offer prayers properly."

Thus he will maintain the upper planetary system by inducing the populace to perform Vedic sacrifices. In due course of time he will also maintain this earthly planet by discharging proper rainfall.",
        "purport": " The demigods in charge of the various departmental activities that maintain this world are but assistants to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When an incarnation of Godhead descends to this planet, demigods like the sun-god, the moon-god or the King of heaven, Indra, all join Him. Consequently the incarnation of Godhead is able to act for the departmental demigods to keep the planetary systems in order. The protection of the earthly planet is dependent on proper rainfall, and as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and other scriptures, sacrifices are performed to please those demigods who are in charge of rainfall: \u201cAll living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by performance of yaj\u00f1a [sacrifice], and yaj\u00f1a is born of prescribed duties.\u201d (Bg. 3.14) Thus the proper execution of yaj\u00f1a, sacrifice, is required. As indicated herein, King P\u1e5bthu alone would induce all the citizens to engage in such sacrificial activities so that there would not be scarcity or distress. In Kali-yuga, however, in the so-called secular state, the executive branch of government is in the charge of so-called kings and presidents who are all fools and rascals, ignorant of the intricacies of nature\u2019s causes and ignorant of the principles of sacrifice. Such rascals simply make various plans, which always fail, and the people subsequently suffer disturbances. To counteract this situation, the \u015b\u0101stras advise: Thus in order to counteract this unfortunate situation in government, the general populace is advised to chant the mah\u0101-mantra: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."

The example of the sun in this verse is very appropriate. The sun is many millions of miles away from the earth, and although the sun does not actually touch the earth, it manages to distribute land all over the planet by exacting water from the oceans and seas, and it also manages to make that land fertile by distributing water during the rainy season.

The king of that underwater kingdom is Varu\u1e47a. Just as no one can understand what is going on beneath the sea, no one could understand what policy King P\u1e5bthu was following to make everything successful. Indeed, King P\u1e5bthu\u2019s path of diplomacy was very grave. His success was made possible because he was a reservoir of unlimited glorified qualities. The word upagupta-vitta\u1e25 is very significant in this verse. It indicates that no one would know the extent of the riches King P\u1e5bthu would confidentially keep. The idea is that not only the king but everyone should keep his hard-earned money confidentially and secretly so that in due course of time the money can be spent for good, practical purposes. In Kali-yuga, however, the king or government has no well-protected treasury, and the only means of circulation is currency notes made of paper. Thus in times of distress the government artificially inflates the currency by simply printing papers, and this artificially raises the price of commodities, and the general condition of the citizens becomes very precarious. Thus keeping one\u2019s money very secretly is an old practice, for we find this practice present even during the reign of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu. Just as the king has the right to keep his treasury confidential and secret, the people should also keep their individual earnings a secret. There is no fault in such dealings. The main point is that everyone should be trained in the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma so that the money is spent only for good causes and nothing else."

One should execute what he has learned in his personal life. These learned characteristics were verily manifest in the life of King P\u1e5bthu. Although he was the king, he treated himself as a servant of the Lord\u2019s devotees. According to Vedic etiquette, if a devotee came to a king\u2019s palace, the king would immediately offer his own seat to him. The word brahma-v\u0101din\u0101m is very significant. Brahma-v\u0101d\u012b refers to the devotees of the Lord. Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n are different terms for the Supreme Brahman, and the Supreme Brahman is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is accepted in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.12) by Arjuna (para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma). Thus the word brahma-v\u0101din\u0101m refers to the devotees of the Lord. The state should always serve the devotees of the Lord, and the ideal state should conduct itself according to the instructions of the devotee. Because King P\u1e5bthu followed this principle, he is highly praised."

Being a liberated soul and completely learned, he sees all material varieties as meaningless because their basic principle is nescience.",
        "purport": " The reciters of these prayers are describing the transcendental qualities of P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. These qualities are summarized in the words s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagav\u0101n. This indicates that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead and therefore possesses unlimited good qualities. Being an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu could not be equaled in his excellent qualities. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is fully equipped with six kinds of opulences, and King P\u1e5bthu was also empowered in such a way that he could display these six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in full. The word k\u016b\u1e6da-stha, meaning \u201cwithout change,\u201d is also very significant. There are two kinds of living entities \u2014 nitya-mukta and nitya-baddha. A nitya-mukta never forgets his position as the eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who does not forget this position and knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord is nitya-mukta. Such a nitya-mukta living entity represents the Supersoul as His expansion. As stated in the Vedas, nityo nity\u0101n\u0101m. Thus the nitya-mukta living entity knows that he is an expansion of the supreme nitya, or the eternal Supreme Personality of Godhead. Being in such a position, he sees the material world with a different vision. The living entity who is nitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned, sees the material varieties as being actually different from one another. In this connection we should remember that the embodiment of the conditioned soul is considered to be like a dress. One may dress in different ways, but a really learned man does not take dresses into consideration. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.18): \u201cThe humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].\u201d Thus a learned man does not look upon the dresses that externally cover the living entity, but sees the pure soul within the varieties of dress and knows very well that the varieties of dress are the creation of nescience (avidy\u0101-racitam). Being a \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba-avat\u0101ra, empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not change his spiritual position, and consequently there was no possibility of his viewing the material world as reality."

This is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and also in other parts of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. In the Fifth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that the sun rotates in its own orbit at the rate of sixteen thousand miles per second. Similarly, Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 states, yasy\u0101j\u00f1ay\u0101 bhramati sambh\u1e5bta-k\u0101la-cakra\u1e25: the sun rotates in its own orbit according to the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conclusion is that the sun is not fixed in one place. As far as P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is concerned, it is indicated that his ruling power would extend all over the world. The Him\u0101laya Mountains, from which the sunrise is first seen, are called uday\u0101cala or uday\u0101dri. It is herein indicated that P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s reign over the world would cover even the Him\u0101laya Mountains and extend to the borders of all oceans and seas. In other words, his reign would cover the entire planet. Another significant word in this verse is naradeva. As described in previous verses, the qualified king \u2014 be he King P\u1e5bthu or any other king who rules over the state as an ideal king \u2014 should be understood to be God in human form. According to Vedic culture, the king is honored as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because he represents N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, who also gives protection to the citizens. He is therefore n\u0101tha, or the proprietor. Even San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b gave respect to the Nawab Hussain Shah as naradeva, although the Nawab was Muhammadan. A king or governmental head must therefore be so competent to rule over the state that the citizens will worship him as God in human form. That is the perfectional stage for the head of any government or state."

Then he will be recognized all over the world. At that time both the suras and the asuras will undoubtedly glorify his magnanimous activities.",
        "purport": " At the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, the world was ruled by one emperor, although there were many subordinate states. Just as there are many united states in various parts of the world, in olden days the entire world was ruled through many states, but there was a supreme emperor who ruled over all subsidiary states. As soon as there were some discrepancies in the maintenance of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, the emperor would immediately take charge of the small states. The word utp\u0101\u1e6dita-loka-\u015balya\u1e25 indicates that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu completely uprooted all the miseries of his citizens. The word \u015balya means \u201cpiercing thorns.\u201d There are many kinds of miserable thorns that pierce the citizens of a state, but all competent rulers, even up to the reign of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, uprooted all the miserable conditions of the citizens. It is stated that during the reign of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira there did not even exist severe cold or scorching heat, nor did the citizens suffer from any kind of mental anxiety. This is the standard of good government. Such a peaceful and prosperous government, devoid of anxiety, was established by P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Thus the inhabitants of both saintly and demoniac planets were all engaged in glorifying the activities of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu. Persons or nations anxious to spread their influence all over the world should consider this point. If one is able to eradicate completely the threefold miseries of the citizens, he should aspire to rule the world. One should not aspire to rule for any political or diplomatic consideration."
