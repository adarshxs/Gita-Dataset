Since the living entities cannot realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead by material names, activities or qualities, He remains everlastingly unknown to the conditioned soul.",
        "purport": " Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unknown to the conditioned soul, He is sometimes described in Vedic literatures as nir\u0101k\u0101ra, avij\u00f1\u0101ta or av\u0101\u1e45-m\u0101nasa-gocara. Actually it is a fact that the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be perceived by material senses as far as His form, name, quality, pastimes or paraphernalia are concerned. However, when one is spiritually advanced, one can understand the name, form, qualities, pastimes and paraphernalia of the Supreme Lord. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55). Bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25: one can understand in truth the Supreme Personality of Godhead only when one is engaged in devotional service. Ordinary persons engaged in pious and impious activities cannot understand the form, name and activities of the Lord. The devotee, however, can know the Personality of Godhead in many respects. He can understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that His address is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and that His activities are all spiritual. Because the Lord\u2019s form and activities cannot be understood by materialistic people, He is described by the \u015b\u0101stras as nir\u0101k\u0101ra, that is, one whose form cannot be ascertained by a materialistic person. This does not mean that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no form; it means that it is not understood by the karm\u012bs, or fruitive actors. His form is described in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. As confirmed by the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a:"

In this verse the words pumbhir n\u0101mabhir v\u0101 kriy\u0101-gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 are especially significant because God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has many names, activities and qualities, although none of them are material. Despite the fact that all these names, activities and pastimes are mentioned in the \u015b\u0101stras and understood by the devotees, the karm\u012bs (fruitive laborers) cannot understand them. Nor can the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs (mental speculators) understand them. Although there are thousands of names of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs intermingle the names of the Supreme Godhead with the names of demigods and human beings. Because they cannot understand the actual name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they take it for granted that any name can be accepted. They believe that since the Absolute Truth is impersonal, they can call Him by any name. Otherwise, they maintain, He has no name. This is not a fact. Here it is clearly stated: n\u0101mabhir v\u0101 kriy\u0101-gu\u1e47ai\u1e25. The Lord has specific names such as R\u0101ma, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Govinda, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Adhok\u1e63aja. There are indeed many names, but the conditioned soul cannot understand them."

A particular type of animal may have a strong tendency to enjoy one kind of sense enjoyment, but in the human form one can enjoy all the senses. The human form has the facility to utilize all the senses for gratification.

When this is done, the Supreme Personality of Godhead from within gives one the real intelligence by which one can return home, back to Godhead. Intelligence in the material world is described in this verse as pramad\u0101 because in material existence the living entity falsely claims things to be his. He thinks, \u201cI am the monarch of all I survey.\u201d This is ignorance. Actually, nothing belongs to him. Even the body and the senses do not belong to him, for they are given to him by the grace of the Lord to satisfy his different propensities through the material energy. Nothing actually belongs to the living entity, but he becomes mad after everything, claiming, \u201cThis is mine. This is mine. This is mine.\u201d Janasya moho\u00a0\u2019yam aha\u1e41 mameti.

Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu recommends that this false intelligence be purified (ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam). When the mirror of intelligence is polished, the real activities of the living entity begin. This means that when a person comes to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his real intelligence acts. At that time he knows that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and nothing belongs to him. As long as one thinks that everything belongs to him, he is in material consciousness, and when he knows perfectly that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Even in such a sacred place as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, India, unintelligent men pass off this rectal and genital business as spiritual activity. Such people are called sahajiy\u0101. According to their philosophy, through sexual indulgence one can elevate oneself to the spiritual platform. From these verses of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, however, we understand that the desires for sexual satisfaction are meant for the arv\u0101k, the lowest among men. To rectify these rascals and fools is very difficult. After all, the sex desires of the common man are condemned in these verses. The word durmada means \u201cwrongly directed,\u201d and nir\u1e5bti means \u201csinful activity.\u201d Although this clearly indicates that sex indulgence is abominable and misdirected even from the ordinary point of view, the sahajiy\u0101s nonetheless pass themselves off as devotees conducting spiritual activities. For this reason, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is no longer visited by intelligent men. We are often asked why we have made our center in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. From the external point of view, it can be concluded that V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana has become degenerate due to these sahajiy\u0101 activities, yet from the spiritual point of view, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is the only place where all these sinful persons can be rectified by means of taking birth in the forms of dogs, hogs and monkeys. By living in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as a dog, hog or monkey, the living entity can be elevated to the spiritual platform in the next life."

Intelligence is the chariot driver. The heart is the sitting place in the chariot, and the dualities of life, such as pleasure and pain, are the knotting place. The seven elements are the coverings of the chariot, and the working senses are the five external processes. The eleven senses are the soldiers.

In the words of Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura: The living entity struggles very hard due to the influence of fruitive activity and mental speculation and simply gets a different type of body life after life. He eats all kinds of nonsense and is condemned by his activities of sense enjoyment. If one really wants to progress in life, he must give up the ways of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da and j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, fruitive activities and mental speculation. Being fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can become free from the entanglement of birth and death and the vain struggle for existence. In these verses the words m\u1e5bga-t\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 pradh\u0101vati are very significant because the living entity is influenced by a thirst for sense enjoyment. He is like a deer that goes to the desert to search out water. In a desert an animal simply searches in vain for water. Of course there is no water in the desert, and the animal simply sacrifices his life in an attempt to find it. Everyone is planning for future happiness, thinking that if he can somehow or other reach a certain point he will be happy. In actuality, however, when he comes to that point he sees that there is no happiness. He then plans to go further and further to another point. This is called m\u1e5bga-t\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101, and its basis is sense enjoyment in this material world."

Prajv\u0101ra represents the two types of fever: extreme heat and extreme cold \u2014 typhoid and pneumonia. The living entity lying down within the body is disturbed by many tribulations pertaining to providence, to other living entities and to his own body and mind. Despite all kinds of tribulations, the living entity, subjected to the necessities of the body, mind and senses and suffering from various types of disease, is carried away by many plans due to his lust to enjoy the world. Although transcendental to this material existence, the living entity, out of ignorance, accepts all these material miseries under the pretext of false egoism (\u201cI\u201d and \u201cmine\u201d). In this way he lives for a hundred years within this body.",
        "purport": " In the Vedas it is stated: asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25: the living entity is actually separate from material existence, for the soul is not material. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is also said that the living entity is the superior energy and the material elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air and so on \u2014 are the inferior energy. The material elements are also described as bhinna, or separated energy. When the internal or superior energy comes in contact with the external energy, it is subjected to so many tribulations. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14) the Lord also says, m\u0101tr\u0101-spar\u015b\u0101s tu kaunteya \u015b\u012bto\u1e63\u1e47a-sukha-du\u1e25kha-d\u0101\u1e25: because of the material body, the living entity is subjected to many tribulations brought about by air, water, fire, extreme heat, extreme cold, sunshine, excessive eating, unhealthy food, maladjustments of the three elements of the body (kapha, pitta and v\u0101yu), and so on. The intestines, the throat, the brain and the other parts of the body are affected by all kinds of diseases that are so powerful that they become sources of extreme suffering for the living entity. The living entity, however, is different from all these material elements. The two types of fever described in this verse can be explained in contemporary language as pneumonia and typhoid. When there is an extreme fever in the body, there is typhoid and pneumonia, and they are described as Prajv\u0101ra. There are also other miseries created by other living entities \u2014 the state exacts taxes, and there are also many thieves, rogues and cheaters. Miseries brought about by other living entities are called adhibhautika. There are also miseries in the form of famine, pestilence, scarcity, war, earthquakes and so on. These are caused by the demigods or other sources beyond our control. Actually there are many enemies of the living entities, and these are all described to point out how miserable this material existence is."

        "translation": "The followers of Yavane\u015bvara [Yamar\u0101ja] are called the soldiers of death, and they are known as the various types of disturbances that pertain to the body and mind. Prajv\u0101ra represents the two types of fever: extreme heat and extreme cold \u2014 typhoid and pneumonia. The living entity lying down within the body is disturbed by many tribulations pertaining to providence, to other living entities and to his own body and mind. Despite all kinds of tribulations, the living entity, subjected to the necessities of the body, mind and senses and suffering from various types of disease, is carried away by many plans due to his lust to enjoy the world. Although transcendental to this material existence, the living entity, out of ignorance, accepts all these material miseries under the pretext of false egoism (\u201cI\u201d and \u201cmine\u201d). In this way he lives for a hundred years within this body.",
        "purport": " In the Vedas it is stated: asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25: the living entity is actually separate from material existence, for the soul is not material. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is also said that the living entity is the superior energy and the material elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air and so on \u2014 are the inferior energy. The material elements are also described as bhinna, or separated energy. When the internal or superior energy comes in contact with the external energy, it is subjected to so many tribulations. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14) the Lord also says, m\u0101tr\u0101-spar\u015b\u0101s tu kaunteya \u015b\u012bto\u1e63\u1e47a-sukha-du\u1e25kha-d\u0101\u1e25: because of the material body, the living entity is subjected to many tribulations brought about by air, water, fire, extreme heat, extreme cold, sunshine, excessive eating, unhealthy food, maladjustments of the three elements of the body (kapha, pitta and v\u0101yu), and so on. The intestines, the throat, the brain and the other parts of the body are affected by all kinds of diseases that are so powerful that they become sources of extreme suffering for the living entity. The living entity, however, is different from all these material elements. The two types of fever described in this verse can be explained in contemporary language as pneumonia and typhoid. When there is an extreme fever in the body, there is typhoid and pneumonia, and they are described as Prajv\u0101ra. There are also other miseries created by other living entities \u2014 the state exacts taxes, and there are also many thieves, rogues and cheaters. Miseries brought about by other living entities are called adhibhautika. There are also miseries in the form of famine, pestilence, scarcity, war, earthquakes and so on. These are caused by the demigods or other sources beyond our control. Actually there are many enemies of the living entities, and these are all described to point out how miserable this material existence is. Knowing the basic misery of material existence, one should be induced to get out of the material clutches and return home, back to Godhead. Actually the living entity is not at all happy in this material body. Because of the body, he suffers thirst and hunger and is influenced by the mind, by words, by anger, by the belly, by the genitals, by the rectum, and so on. Manifold miseries encircle the transcendental living entity simply because he desires to satisfy his senses in this material world. If he simply withdraws from activities of sense gratification and applies his senses in the service of the Lord, all the problems of material existence will immediately diminish. With the advancement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness he will be freed from all tribulations, and after giving up the body he will go back home, back to Godhead."

Those who are influenced by the mode of passion engage in various types of productive activities in the planetary systems where human beings live. Similarly, those influenced by the mode of darkness are subjected to various types of misery and live in the animal kingdom.",
        "purport": " There are three planetary systems \u2014 upper, middle and lower. Those influenced by the mode of goodness are given places in the upper planetary systems \u2014 Brahmaloka (Satyaloka), Tapoloka, Janaloka and Maharloka. Those influenced by the mode of passion are given places in the Bh\u016brloka and Bhuvarloka. Those influenced by the mode of ignorance are given places in Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Tal\u0101tala, Mah\u0101tala, Ras\u0101tala, P\u0101t\u0101la or the animal kingdom. Qualitatively the living entity is the same as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because of his forgetfulness he gets different bodies in different planetary systems. At the present moment human society is overly influenced by the mode of passion, and consequently people are engaged in working in big factories. They forget how distressful it is to live in such places. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 such activities are described as ugra-karma, that is, distressful activities. Those who utilize the energies of the worker are called capitalists, and those who actually perform the work are called laborers. In actuality they are both capitalists, and the workers are in the modes of passion and ignorance. The result is that there is always a distressful situation. In contrast to these men are those influenced by the mode of goodness \u2014 the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs. The karm\u012bs, under the direction of Vedic instructions, try to elevate themselves to higher planetary systems. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs try to merge into the existence of Brahman, the impersonal feature of the Lord. In this way all classes of living entities in various species of life are existing within this material world. This explains superior and inferior life-forms within the material world."

The living entity is never material, and his material conception is simply a mistake due to forgetfulness. He is as brilliant as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Both the sun and the sunshine are very brilliant. The Lord is like the full shining sun, and the living entities are like the small particles of that sun which constitute the all-pervasive sunshine. When these small particles are covered by the cloud of m\u0101y\u0101, they lose their shining capacity. When the cloud of m\u0101y\u0101 is gone, the particles again become brilliant and shining. As soon as the living entity is covered by the ignorance of m\u0101y\u0101, or darkness, he cannot understand his relationship with the Supreme God. Somehow or other, if he comes before the Lord, he can see himself shining like the Supreme Lord, although he is not as extensive as the Lord. Because the living entity desires to imitate the Supreme Lord, he is covered by m\u0101y\u0101. We cannot imitate the Lord, nor can we become the supreme enjoyer. This is not possible, and when we think it is, we become conditioned by m\u0101y\u0101. Thus the encagement of the living entity under the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 is brought about by forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord. Under the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, the living entity becomes exactly like a person haunted by a ghost. Such a person speaks all kinds of nonsense. When the living entity is covered by the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, he becomes a so-called scientist, philosopher, politician or socialist, and at every moment presents different plans for the benefit of human society. All these plans are ultimately failures because they are illusory. In this way the living entity forgets his position as an eternal servant of the Lord. He instead becomes a servant of m\u0101y\u0101. In any case he remains a servant. It is his misfortune that by forgetting his real contact with the Supreme Lord, he becomes a servant of m\u0101y\u0101. As servant of m\u0101y\u0101, he sometimes becomes a king, sometimes an ordinary citizen, sometimes a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a \u015b\u016bdra, and so on. Sometimes he is a happy man, sometimes a prosperous man, sometimes a small insect. Sometimes he is in heaven and sometimes in hell. Sometimes he is a demigod, and sometimes he is a demon. Sometimes he is a servant, and sometimes he is a master. In this way the living entity wanders all over the universe. Only when he comes in contact with the bona fide spiritual master can he understand his real constitutional position. He then becomes disgusted with material existence. At that time, in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he regrets his past experiences in material existence. This regret is very beneficial because it purifies the living entity of material, conditional life. He then prays to the Lord to engage in His service, and at that time, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a grants liberation from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): \u201cThis divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.

It is not possible to get out by mental speculation or other activities. When the living entity understands his real position by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he keeps himself always fit in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and acts accordingly. Thus he gradually becomes completely free from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. When he is strong in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, m\u0101y\u0101 cannot touch him.

        "purport": " The living entity\u2019s position is herein likened to a dog\u2019s. By chance a dog may have a very rich owner, and by chance he may become a street dog. As the dog of a rich man, he will live very opulently. Sometimes in Western countries we hear of a master leaving millions of dollars to a dog in his will. Of course, there are many dogs loitering in the street without food. Therefore, to liken the conditional existence of the living entity to that of a dog is very appropriate. An intelligent human being, however, can understand that if he has to live the life of a dog, he had best become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s dog. In the material world a dog is sometimes elevated and is sometimes on the street, but in the spiritual world, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s dog is perpetually, eternally happy. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has therefore sung, vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u1e6dh\u0101kura, tom\u0101ra kukura, baliy\u0101 j\u0101naha more. In this way Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura offers to become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u2019s dog. A dog always keeps himself at his master\u2019s door and does not allow any person unfavorable to the master to enter. Similarly, one should engage in the service of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and try to please him in every respect. Unless one does so, he does not make spiritual advancement. Apart from spiritual advancement, in the material world if one does not develop his qualities in goodness, he cannot be promoted to the higher planetary system.

As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.18) One should simply try to develop his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and not waste his time trying to improve his material condition. Actually the material condition cannot be improved. The process of improvement means accepting another miserable condition. However, if we endeavor to improve our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the distresses of material life will disappear without extraneous endeavor. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore promises, kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.\u201d (Bg. 9.31) One who takes to the path of devotional service will never be vanquished, despite all miseries of the body and mind and despite all misery brought about by other living entities and providence, miseries which are beyond our control."

This does not mean that he has become freed from the strains of carrying the burden. Similarly, human society in the name of civilization is creating one kind of trouble to avoid another kind of trouble. In contemporary civilization we see that there are many automobiles manufactured to carry us swiftly from one place to another, but at the same time we have created other problems. We have to construct so many roads, and yet these roads are insufficient to cope with automobile congestion and traffic jams. There are also the problems of air pollution and fuel shortage. The conclusion is that the processes we manufacture to counteract or minimize our distresses do not actually put an end to our pains. It is all simply illusion. We simply place the burden from the head to the shoulder. The only real way we can minimize our problems is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead and give ourselves up to His protection. The Lord, being all-powerful, can make arrangements to mitigate our painful life in material existence."

No one can counteract the effects of fruitive activity simply by manufacturing a different activity devoid of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. All such activity is due to our ignorance. When we have a troublesome dream, we cannot relieve it with a troublesome hallucination. One can counteract a dream only by awaking. Similarly, our material existence is due to our ignorance and illusion. Unless we awaken to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we cannot be relieved of such dreams. For the ultimate solution to all problems, we must awaken to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
        "purport": " There are two kinds of fruitive activity: we can place the burden on the head, or we can place it on the shoulder. Actually, keeping the burden in either place is the same. The transferal, however, is taking place under the name of counteraction. In this connection Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said that fools and rascals in the material world plan so gorgeously for bodily comfort without knowing that such arrangements, even if successful, are only m\u0101y\u0101. People are working hard day and night for the illusory happiness of the body. This is not a way to achieve happiness. One has to get out of this material entanglement and return home, back to Godhead. That is real happiness. The Vedas therefore enjoin: \u201cDon\u2019t remain in the darkness of this material world. Go to the light of the spiritual world.\u201d To counteract the distress of this material body, one has to take on another distressed condition. Both situations are only illusion. There is no gain in taking on one trouble to counteract another trouble. The conclusion is that one cannot be perpetually happy as long as one exists in this material world. The only remedy is to get out of this material world altogether and return home, back to Godhead."

The secret of success in the cultivation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is hearing from the right person. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is never disturbed by the bodily necessities, namely eating, sleeping, mating and defending."

        "purport": " Unless one is associated with devotees, he cannot cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Nirjana-bhajana, cultivating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in a solitary place, is not possible for the neophyte, for he will be disturbed by the bodily necessities \u2014 eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Being so disturbed, one cannot cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We therefore see that devotees known as sahajiy\u0101, who make everything very easy, do not associate with advanced devotees. Such persons, in the name of devotional activities, are addicted to all kinds of sinful acts \u2014 illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. There are many so-called devotees passing themselves off as devotees while engaging in these sinful activities. In other words, one who is influenced by sinful activity cannot be accepted as a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A person addicted to sinful life cannot develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as indicated in this verse."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood not by advanced knowledge but by pure devotional service, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55). Bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25: unless one takes to pure, transcendental devotional service, he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in truth. Everyone has some imperfect ideas about the Lord. So-called scientists and philosophical speculators are unable to understand the Supreme Lord by virtue of their knowledge. Knowledge is not perfect unless one comes to the platform of devotional service. This is confirmed by the Vedic version: The speculators, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, go on speculating about the Supreme Personality of Godhead for many, many hundreds of thousands of years, but unless one is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot understand His supreme glories. All the great sages mentioned in this verse have their planets near Brahmaloka, the planet where Lord Brahm\u0101 resides along with four great sages \u2014 Sanaka, San\u0101tana, Sanandana and Sanat-kum\u0101ra. These sages reside in different stars known as the southern stars, which circle the polestar. The polestar, called Dhruvaloka, is the pivot of this universe, and all planets move around this polestar. All the stars are planets, as far as we can see, within this one universe. According to Western theory, all the stars are different suns, but according to Vedic information, there is only one sun within this universe. All the so-called stars are but different planets. Besides this universe, there are many millions of other universes, and each of them contains similar innumerable stars and planets."

Each demigod has a particular power. For instance, the demigod Indra, the King of heaven, has power to shower rain on the surface of the globe to give sufficient vegetation to the earth. This demigod is described in the Vedas: vajra-hasta\u1e25 purandara\u1e25. Indra rules the water supply with a thunderbolt in his hand. The thunderbolt itself is controlled by Indra. Similarly, other demigods \u2014 Agni, Varu\u1e47a, Candra, S\u016brya \u2014 have particular powers. All these demigods are worshiped in the Vedic hymns through a symbolic weapon.

In these two verses both the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are described as unfit to understand Him. As described by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, only when one is completely free from mental speculation and fruitive activity (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam) can one engage in pure devotional service without being polluted by material desires. The significant word \u0101tma-bh\u0101vita\u1e25 indicates that the Lord is awakened in one\u2019s mind if one constantly thinks of Him. A pure devotee is always thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25). A pure devotee cannot remain a moment without being absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This constant thinking of the Lord is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as satata-yukt\u0101n\u0101m, always engaging in the Lord\u2019s service. Bhajat\u0101\u1e41 pr\u012bti-p\u016brvakam: this is devotional service in love and affection. Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead dictates to the pure devotee from within, the devotee is saved from all material activities. Even the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies are considered material activities because by such activities one is simply elevated to other planetary systems, the residential abodes of the demigods. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25): \u201cThose who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with Me.\u201d The word \u0101tma-bh\u0101vita\u1e25 also indicates that a devotee is always engaged in preaching to deliver conditioned souls. It is said of the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, n\u0101n\u0101-\u015b\u0101stra-vic\u0101ra\u1e47aika-nipu\u1e47au sad-dharma-sa\u1e41sth\u0101pakau lok\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 hita-k\u0101ri\u1e47au. A pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always thinking of how the fallen, conditioned souls can be delivered. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, influenced by the merciful devotees\u2019 attempt to deliver fallen souls, enlightens the people in general from within by His causeless mercy. If a devotee is blessed by another devotee, he becomes free from karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da and j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da activities. As confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, vede\u1e63u durlabham: the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be realized through karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da and j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. Adurlabham \u0101tma-bhaktau: the Lord is realized only by a sincere devotee. This material world, the cosmic manifestation, is created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the living entities have come here to enjoy themselves. The Vedic instructions guide them according to different regulative principles, and intelligent people take advantage of these instructions. They thus enjoy material life without being disturbed. This is actually illusion, and to get out of this illusion by one\u2019s own endeavor is very difficult. The general populace is engaged in material activities, and when people are a little advanced, they become attracted by the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas. However, when one is frustrated in the performance of these ritualistic ceremonies, he again comes to material activities. In this way both the followers of the Vedic rituals and the followers of material activities are entangled in conditional life. These people get the seed of devotional service only by the good will of the guru and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is confirmed in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta: guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja. When one is engaged in devotional service, he is no longer attracted to material activities. When a man is covered by different designations, he cannot engage in devotional service. One has to become freed from such designative activities (sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmuktam) and become pure in order to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead through purified senses.

The sincere devotee is always helped by the Supersoul, who resides within the heart of every living entity, as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d This is the stage of becoming free from the contamination of the material world. At such a time a devotee makes friends with another devotee, and his engagement in material activities ceases completely. At that time, he attains the favor of the Lord and loses his faith in material civilization, which begins with var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu speaks clearly of one\u2019s becoming liberated from the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, the most exalted system of human civilization. At such a time one feels himself to be perpetually the servant of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, a position taken by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu Himself:"

This verse indicates, however, that such sacrifices are to be taken as illusory. Actually the aim of human life should be God realization, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The Vedic performances are, of course, very glittering and pleasing to hear about, but they do not serve the real purpose of life."

Actually, anything that is done which does not lead to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a sinful activity, and any education that does not lead one to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is false education.

In Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said: \u201cEven if a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is very learned in Vedic scriptures and knows the six occupational duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he cannot become a guru, or spiritual master, unless he is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, if one is born in a family of dog-eaters but is a pure devotee of the Lord, he can become a spiritual master.\u201d The conclusion is that one cannot become a spiritual master unless he is a pure devotee of the Lord. One who is a spiritual master in accordance with the above descriptions of devotional service is to be understood as the Supreme Personality of Godhead personally present. According to the words mentioned here (gurur hari\u1e25), consulting a bona fide spiritual master means consulting the Supreme Personality of Godhead personally. One should therefore take shelter of such a bona fide spiritual master. Success in life means accepting a spiritual master who knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the only supreme beloved personality. One should worship such a confidential devotee of the Lord."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni is personally acting as the spiritual master of King Barhi\u1e63m\u0101n. It was N\u0101rada Muni\u2019s intention that through his instructions the King would immediately give up all engagement in fruitive activity and take to devotional service. However, although the King understood everything, he was still not prepared to give up his engagements. As the following verses will show, the King was contemplating sending for his sons, who were away from home executing austerities and penances; after their return he would entrust his kingdom to them and then leave home. This is the position of most people: they accept a bona fide spiritual master and listen to him, but when the spiritual master indicates that they should leave home and fully engage in devotional service, they hesitate. The duty of the spiritual master is to instruct the disciple as long as he does not come to the understanding that this materialistic way of life, fruitive activity, is not at all beneficial. Actually, one should take to devotional service from the beginning of life, as Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja advised: kaum\u0101ra \u0101caret pr\u0101j\u00f1o dharm\u0101n bh\u0101gavat\u0101n iha (Bh\u0101g. 7.6.1). According to all the instructions of the Vedas, we can understand that unless one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service, he is simply wasting his time engaging in the fruitive activities of material existence. N\u0101rada Muni therefore decided to relate another allegory to the King so that he might be induced to give up family life within material existence."

        "translation": "My dear King, woman, who is very attractive in the beginning but in the end very disturbing, is exactly like the flower, which is attractive in the beginning and detestable at the end. With woman, the living entity is entangled with lusty desires, and he enjoys sex, just as one enjoys the aroma of a flower. He thus enjoys a life of sense gratification \u2014 from his tongue to his genitals \u2014 and in this way the living entity considers himself very happy in family life. United with his wife, he always remains absorbed in such thoughts. He feels great pleasure in hearing the talks of his wife and children, which are like the sweet humming of bumblebees that collect honey from flower to flower. He forgets that before him is time, which is taking away his life span with the passing of day and night. He does not see the gradual diminishing of his life, nor does he care about the superintendent of death, who is trying to kill him from behind. Just try to understand this. You are in a precarious position and are threatened from all sides.",
        "purport": " Materialistic life means forgetting one\u2019s constitutional position as the eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this forgetfulness is especially enhanced in the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. In the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama a young man accepts a young wife who is very beautiful in the beginning, but in due course of time, after giving birth to many children and becoming older and older, she demands many things from the husband to maintain the entire family. At such a time the wife becomes detestable to the very man who accepted her in her younger days. One becomes attached to the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama for two reasons only: the wife cooks palatable dishes for the satisfaction of her husband\u2019s tongue, and she gives him sexual pleasure at night. A person attached to the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama is always thinking of these two things \u2014 palatable food and sex enjoyment. The talks of the wife, which are enjoyed as a family recreation, and the talks of the children both attract the living entity. He thus forgets that he has to die someday and has to prepare for the next life if he wants to be put into a congenial body."

        "translation": "My dear King, woman, who is very attractive in the beginning but in the end very disturbing, is exactly like the flower, which is attractive in the beginning and detestable at the end. With woman, the living entity is entangled with lusty desires, and he enjoys sex, just as one enjoys the aroma of a flower. He thus enjoys a life of sense gratification \u2014 from his tongue to his genitals \u2014 and in this way the living entity considers himself very happy in family life. United with his wife, he always remains absorbed in such thoughts. He feels great pleasure in hearing the talks of his wife and children, which are like the sweet humming of bumblebees that collect honey from flower to flower. He forgets that before him is time, which is taking away his life span with the passing of day and night. He does not see the gradual diminishing of his life, nor does he care about the superintendent of death, who is trying to kill him from behind. Just try to understand this. You are in a precarious position and are threatened from all sides.",
        "purport": " Materialistic life means forgetting one\u2019s constitutional position as the eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this forgetfulness is especially enhanced in the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. In the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama a young man accepts a young wife who is very beautiful in the beginning, but in due course of time, after giving birth to many children and becoming older and older, she demands many things from the husband to maintain the entire family. At such a time the wife becomes detestable to the very man who accepted her in her younger days. One becomes attached to the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama for two reasons only: the wife cooks palatable dishes for the satisfaction of her husband\u2019s tongue, and she gives him sexual pleasure at night. A person attached to the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama is always thinking of these two things \u2014 palatable food and sex enjoyment. The talks of the wife, which are enjoyed as a family recreation, and the talks of the children both attract the living entity. He thus forgets that he has to die someday and has to prepare for the next life if he wants to be put into a congenial body. The deer in the flower garden is an allegory used by the great sage N\u0101rada to point out to the King that the King himself is similarly entrapped by such surroundings. Actually everyone is surrounded by such a family life, which misleads one. The living entity thus forgets that he has to return home, back to Godhead. He simply becomes entangled in family life. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja has therefore hinted, hitv\u0101tma-p\u0101ta\u1e41 g\u1e5bham andha-k\u016bpa\u1e41 vana\u1e41 gato yad dharim \u0101\u015brayeta. Family life is considered a blind well (andha-k\u016bpam) into which a person falls and dies without help. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja recommends that while one\u2019s senses are there and one is strong enough, he should abandon the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama and take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, going to the forest of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. According to Vedic civilization, one has to give up family life at a certain age (the age of fifty), take v\u0101naprastha and eventually remain alone as a sanny\u0101s\u012b. That is the prescribed method of Vedic civilization known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. When one takes sanny\u0101sa after enjoying family life, he pleases the Supreme Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u."

        "translation": "My dear King, woman, who is very attractive in the beginning but in the end very disturbing, is exactly like the flower, which is attractive in the beginning and detestable at the end. With woman, the living entity is entangled with lusty desires, and he enjoys sex, just as one enjoys the aroma of a flower. He thus enjoys a life of sense gratification \u2014 from his tongue to his genitals \u2014 and in this way the living entity considers himself very happy in family life. United with his wife, he always remains absorbed in such thoughts. He feels great pleasure in hearing the talks of his wife and children, which are like the sweet humming of bumblebees that collect honey from flower to flower. He forgets that before him is time, which is taking away his life span with the passing of day and night. He does not see the gradual diminishing of his life, nor does he care about the superintendent of death, who is trying to kill him from behind. Just try to understand this. You are in a precarious position and are threatened from all sides.",
        "purport": " Materialistic life means forgetting one\u2019s constitutional position as the eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this forgetfulness is especially enhanced in the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. In the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama a young man accepts a young wife who is very beautiful in the beginning, but in due course of time, after giving birth to many children and becoming older and older, she demands many things from the husband to maintain the entire family. At such a time the wife becomes detestable to the very man who accepted her in her younger days. One becomes attached to the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama for two reasons only: the wife cooks palatable dishes for the satisfaction of her husband\u2019s tongue, and she gives him sexual pleasure at night. A person attached to the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama is always thinking of these two things \u2014 palatable food and sex enjoyment. The talks of the wife, which are enjoyed as a family recreation, and the talks of the children both attract the living entity. He thus forgets that he has to die someday and has to prepare for the next life if he wants to be put into a congenial body. The deer in the flower garden is an allegory used by the great sage N\u0101rada to point out to the King that the King himself is similarly entrapped by such surroundings. Actually everyone is surrounded by such a family life, which misleads one. The living entity thus forgets that he has to return home, back to Godhead. He simply becomes entangled in family life. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja has therefore hinted, hitv\u0101tma-p\u0101ta\u1e41 g\u1e5bham andha-k\u016bpa\u1e41 vana\u1e41 gato yad dharim \u0101\u015brayeta. Family life is considered a blind well (andha-k\u016bpam) into which a person falls and dies without help. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja recommends that while one\u2019s senses are there and one is strong enough, he should abandon the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama and take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, going to the forest of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. According to Vedic civilization, one has to give up family life at a certain age (the age of fifty), take v\u0101naprastha and eventually remain alone as a sanny\u0101s\u012b. That is the prescribed method of Vedic civilization known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. When one takes sanny\u0101sa after enjoying family life, he pleases the Supreme Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. One has to understand one\u2019s position in family or worldly life. That is called intelligence. One should not remain always trapped in family life to satisfy his tongue and genitals in association with a wife. In such a way, one simply spoils his life. According to Vedic civilization, it is imperative to give up the family at a certain stage, by force if necessary. Unfortunately, so-called followers of Vedic life do not give up their family even at the end of life, unless they are forced by death. There should be a thorough overhauling of the social system, and society should revert to the Vedic principles, that is, the four var\u1e47as and the four \u0101\u015bramas."

        "translation": "My dear King, just try to understand the allegorical position of the deer. Be fully conscious of yourself, and give up the pleasure of hearing about promotion to heavenly planets by fruitive activity. Give up household life, which is full of sex, as well as stories about such things, and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the mercy of the liberated souls. In this way, please give up your attraction for material existence.",
        "purport": " In one of his songs, \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura writes: \u201cFruitive activities and mental speculation are simply cups of poison. Whoever drinks of them, thinking them to be nectar, must struggle very hard, life after life, in different types of bodies. Such a person eats all kinds of nonsense and becomes condemned by his activities of so-called sense enjoyment.\u201d People are generally enamored of the fruitive results of worldly activity and mental speculation. They generally desire to be promoted to heavenly planets, merge into the existence of Brahman, or keep themselves in the midst of family life, enchanted by the pleasures of the tongue and genitals. The great sage N\u0101rada clearly instructs King Barhi\u1e63m\u0101n not to remain his entire life in the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. Being in the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama means being under the control of one\u2019s wife. One has to give up all this and put himself into the \u0101\u015brama of the paramaha\u1e41sa, that is, put himself under the control of the spiritual master. The paramaha\u1e41sa-\u0101\u015brama is the \u0101\u015brama of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, under whom the spiritual master has taken shelter. The symptoms of the bona fide spiritual master are stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.3.21): \u201cAny person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of a spiritual master is that he must have realized the conclusion of the scriptures by deliberation and arguments and thus be able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities, who have taken complete shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, are to be understood as bona fide spiritual masters.\u201d A paramaha\u1e41sa is one who has taken shelter of the Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one takes shelter of the paramaha\u1e41sa spiritual master, gradually, through training and instruction, he will become detached from worldly life and ultimately return home, back to Godhead. The particular mention of a\u1e45gan\u0101\u015bramam asattama-y\u016btha-g\u0101tham is very interesting. The whole world is in the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, being controlled by woman. Not only is one controlled by the woman who is one\u2019s wife, but one is also controlled by so many sex literatures. That is the cause of one\u2019s being entangled in the material world. One cannot give up this abominable association through one\u2019s own effort, but if one takes shelter of a bona fide spiritual master who is a paramaha\u1e41sa, he will gradually be elevated to the platform of spiritual life. The pleasing words of the Vedas that inspire one to elevate oneself to the heavenly planets or merge into the existence of the Supreme are for the less intelligent, who are described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25, \u201cthose whose knowledge is taken away by the illusory energy.\u201d Real knowledge means understanding the miserable condition of material life. One should take shelter of a bona fide liberated soul, the spiritual master, and gradually elevate himself to the spiritual platform and thus become detached from the material world. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, ha\u1e41sa-\u015bara\u1e47am refers to the cottage in which saintly persons live. Generally a saintly person lives in a remote place in the forest or in a humble cottage. However, we should note that the times have changed. It may be beneficial for a saintly person\u2019s own interest to go to the forest and live in a cottage, but if one becomes a preacher, especially in Western countries, he has to invite many classes of men who are accustomed to living in comfortable apartments. Therefore in this age a saintly person has to make proper arrangements to receive people and attract them to the message of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, perhaps for the first time, introduced motorcars and palatial buildings for the residence of saintly persons just to attract the general public in big cities. The main fact is that one has to associate with a saintly person. In this age people are not going to search out a saint in the forest, so the saints and sages have to come to the big cities to make arrangements to receive the people in general, who are accustomed to the modern amenities of material life. Gradually such persons will learn that palatial buildings or comfortable apartments are not at all necessary. The real necessity is to become free from material bondage in whatever way possible. According to the orders of \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: \u201cWhen one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is rightly situated above possessiveness.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.255) One should not be attached to material opulence, but material opulence may be accepted in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement to facilitate the propagation of the movement. In other words, material opulence may be accepted as yukta-vair\u0101gya, that is, for renunciation."

        "translation": "The King replied: My dear br\u0101hma\u1e47a, whatever you have said I have heard with great attention and, considering all of it, have come to the conclusion that the \u0101c\u0101ryas [teachers] who engaged me in fruitive activity did not know this confidential knowledge. If they were aware of it, why did they not explain it to me?",
        "purport": " Actually the so-called teachers or leaders of material society do not really know the goal of life. They are described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25. They appear to be very learned scholars, but actually the influence of the illusory energy has taken away their knowledge. Real knowledge means searching out K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). All Vedic knowledge is meant for searching out K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of everything (janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25). In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.2) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101\u1e41: \u201cI am the source of the demigods.\u201d Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin and beginning of all demigods, including Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and all others. The Vedic ritualistic ceremonies are concerned with satisfying different demigods, but unless one is very advanced, he cannot understand that the original personality is \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi). After hearing the instructions of N\u0101rada, King Barhi\u1e63m\u0101n came to his senses. The real goal of life is to attain devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The King therefore decided to reject the so-called priestly orders that simply engage their followers in the ritualistic ceremonies without giving effective instructions about the goal of life. At the present moment the churches, temples and mosques all over the world are not attracting people because foolish priests cannot elevate their followers to the platform of knowledge. Not being aware of the real goal of life, they simply keep their congregations in ignorance. Consequently, those who are well educated have become uninterested in the ritualistic ceremonies. At the same time, they are not benefited with real knowledge. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore very important for the enlightenment of all classes. Following in the footsteps of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Barhi\u1e63m\u0101n, everyone should take advantage of this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement and abandon the stereotyped ritualistic ceremonies that go under the garb of so many religions. The Gosv\u0101m\u012bs from the very beginning differed from the priestly class that was engaged in ritualistic ceremonies. Indeed, \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b compiled his Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa for the guidance of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, not caring for the lifeless activities of the priestly classes, take to full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and become perfect in this very life. That is described in the previous verse as paramaha\u1e41sa-\u015bara\u1e47am, taking shelter of the paramaha\u1e41sa, the liberated soul, and becoming successful in this life."

People generally are attracted by these activities, and very rarely is a person attracted to devotional service, as \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu confirms. Unless one is very, very fortunate, he does not take to devotional service. Even the so-called learned Vedic scholars are bewildered by devotional service. They are generally attracted to the rituals for sense gratification. In devotional service there is no sense gratification, but only transcendental loving service to the Lord. Consequently, the so-called priests engaged in sense gratification do not very much like devotional service. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the priests, have been against this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement since it began with Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. When Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu started this movement, the priestly class lodged complaints to the Kazi, the magistrate of the Muhammadan government. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu had to lead a civil disobedience movement against the propaganda of the so-called followers of Vedic principles. These people are described as karma-ja\u1e0da-sm\u0101rtas, which indicates that they are priests engaged in ritualistic ceremonies. It is here stated that such people become bewildered (\u1e5b\u1e63ayo\u00a0\u2019pi hi muhyanti).

I can now understand how even the great sages are bewildered by the real purpose of life. Of course, there is no question of sense gratification.",
        "purport": " King Barhi\u1e63m\u0101n was engaged in different types of sacrifice for elevation to the heavenly planets. People generally are attracted by these activities, and very rarely is a person attracted to devotional service, as \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu confirms. Unless one is very, very fortunate, he does not take to devotional service. Even the so-called learned Vedic scholars are bewildered by devotional service. They are generally attracted to the rituals for sense gratification. In devotional service there is no sense gratification, but only transcendental loving service to the Lord. Consequently, the so-called priests engaged in sense gratification do not very much like devotional service. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the priests, have been against this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement since it began with Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. When Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu started this movement, the priestly class lodged complaints to the Kazi, the magistrate of the Muhammadan government. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu had to lead a civil disobedience movement against the propaganda of the so-called followers of Vedic principles. These people are described as karma-ja\u1e0da-sm\u0101rtas, which indicates that they are priests engaged in ritualistic ceremonies. It is here stated that such people become bewildered (\u1e5b\u1e63ayo\u00a0\u2019pi hi muhyanti). To save oneself from the hands of these karma-ja\u1e0da-sm\u0101rtas, one should strictly follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\u201d (Bg. 18.66)"

        "translation": "The great sage N\u0101rada continued: The living entity acts in a gross body in this life. This body is forced to act by the subtle body, composed of mind, intelligence and ego. After the gross body is lost, the subtle body is still there to enjoy or suffer. Thus there is no change.",
        "purport": " The living entity has two kinds of body \u2014 the subtle body and the gross body. Actually he enjoys through the subtle body, which is composed of mind, intelligence and ego. The gross body is the instrumental outer covering. When the gross body is lost, or when it dies, the root of the gross body \u2014 the subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego \u2014 continues and brings about another gross body. Although the gross body apparently changes, the real root of the gross body is always there. The subtle body\u2019s activities, be they pious or impious, create another situation for the living entity to enjoy or suffer in the next gross body. Thus the subtle body continues, whereas the gross bodies change one after another. Since modern scientists and philosophers are too materialistic, and since their knowledge is taken away by the illusory energy, they cannot explain how the gross body is changing. The materialistic philosopher Darwin has tried to study the changes of the gross body, but because he had no knowledge of either the subtle body or the soul, he could not clearly explain how the evolutionary process is going on. One may change the gross body, but he works in the subtle body. People cannot understand the activities of the subtle body, and consequently they are bewildered as to how the actions of one gross body affect another gross body. The activities of the subtle body are also guided by the Supersoul, as explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): \u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\u201d Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is always guiding the individual soul, the individual soul always knows how to act according to the reactions of his past karma. In other words, the Supersoul reminds him to act in such a way. Therefore although there is apparently a change in the gross body, there is a continuation between the lives of an individual soul."

The Supreme Lord is always in His sac-cid-\u0101nanda form, but the living entity, although part and parcel of the Lord, becomes materially contaminated when he desires to come to the material world for material enjoyment. The prescription for returning home, back to Godhead, is given by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.34): \u201cAlways think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.\u201d"

Similarly, by the mental condition or consciousness of a person, one can understand his position in the previous life.",
        "purport": " There is an English proverb that says, \u201cThe face is the index of the mind.\u201d If one is angry, his anger is immediately expressed in his face. Similarly, other mental states are reflected by the actions of the gross body. In other words, the activities of the gross body are reactions of the mental condition. The mind\u2019s activities are thinking, feeling and willing. The willing portion of the mind is manifest by the activities of the body. The conclusion is that by the activities of the body and senses, we can understand the condition of the mind. The condition of the mind is affected by past activities in the past body. When the mind is joined with a particular sense, it immediately becomes manifest in a certain way. For instance, when there is anger in the mind, the tongue vibrates so many maledictions. Similarly, when the mind\u2019s anger is expressed through the hand, there is fighting. When it is expressed through the leg, there is kicking. There are so many ways in which the subtle activities of the mind are expressed through the various senses. The mind of a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness also acts in a similar way. The tongue chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the mah\u0101-mantra, the hands are raised in ecstasy, and the legs dance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. These symptoms are technically called a\u1e63\u1e6da-s\u0101ttvika-vik\u0101ra. S\u0101ttvika-vik\u0101ra is transformation of the mental condition in goodness or sometimes transcendental ecstasy."

According to time and circumstance, they combine so that in dreams we see something wonderful that we have never experienced. For instance, we may see an ocean on the peak of a mountain, or we may see that the ocean has dried up. These are simply combinations of different experiences in time and space. Sometimes we may see a golden mountain, and this is due to our having experienced gold and mountains separately. In the dream, under illusion, we combine these separate factors. In this way we are able to see golden mountains, or stars during the day.

        "purport": " Foolish people deny the existence of the soul, but it is a fact that when we sleep we forget the identity of the material body and when we awake we forget the identity of the subtle body. In other words, while sleeping we forget the activities of the gross body, and when active in the gross body we forget the activities of sleeping. Actually both states \u2014 sleeping and waking \u2014 are creations of the illusory energy. The living entity actually has no connection with either the activities of sleep or the activities of the so-called wakened state. When a person is in deep sleep or when he has fainted, he forgets his gross body. Similarly, under chloroform or some other anesthetic, the living entity forgets his gross body and does not feel pain or pleasure during a surgical operation. Similarly, when a man is suddenly shocked by some great loss, he forgets his identification with the gross body. At the time of death, when the temperature of the body rises to 107 degrees, the living entity falls into a coma and is unable to identify his gross body. In such cases, the life air that moves within the body is choked up, and the living entity forgets his identification with the gross body. Because of our ignorance of the spiritual body, of which we have no experience, we do not know of the activities of the spiritual body, and in ignorance we jump from one false platform to another. We act sometimes in relation to the gross body and sometimes in relation to the subtle body. If, by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grace, we act in our spiritual body, we can transcend both the gross and subtle bodies. In other words, we can gradually train ourselves to act in terms of the spiritual body.

In a dream a young man may experience the presence of a young woman because at that time the senses are active. Because of undeveloped senses, a child or boy will not see a young woman in his dreams. The senses are active in youth even when one dreams, and although there may be no young woman present, the senses may act and there may be a seminal discharge (nocturnal emission). The activities of the subtle and gross bodies depend on how developed conditions are. The example of the moon is very appropriate. On a dark-moon night, the full shining moon is still present, but it appears not to be present due to conditions. Similarly, the senses of the living entity are there, but they only become active when the gross body and the subtle body are developed. Unless the senses of the gross body are developed, they will not act on the subtle body. Similarly, because of the absence of desires in the subtle body, there may be no development in the gross body."

The effects of fruitive activities reserved in the subtle body appear in three concurrent stages. One is called b\u012bja (the root), another is called k\u016b\u1e6da-stha (the desire), and another is called phalonmukha (about to fructify). The manifest stage is called pr\u0101rabdha (already in action). In a conscious or unconscious state, the actions of the subtle or gross bodies may not be manifest, but such states cannot be called the liberated state. A child may be innocent, but this does not mean that he is a liberated soul. Everything is held in reservation, and everything will become manifest in due course of time. Even in the absence of certain manifestations in the subtle body, the objects of sense enjoyment may act. The example has been given of a nocturnal emission, in which the physical senses act even when the physical objects are not manifest. The three modes of material nature may not be manifest in the subtle body, but the contamination of the three modes remains conserved, and in due course of time, it becomes manifest. Even if the reactions of the subtle and gross bodies are not manifest, one does not become free from the material conditions. Therefore it is wrong to say that a child is as good as a liberated soul."

        "purport": " A living entity too much absorbed in material activity becomes very much attracted to the material body. Even at the point of death, he thinks of his present body and the relatives connected to it. Thus he remains fully absorbed in the bodily conception of life, so much so that even at the point of death he abhors leaving his present body. Sometimes it is found that a person on the verge of death remains in a coma for many days before giving up the body. This is common among so-called leaders and politicians who think that without their presence the entire country and all society will be in chaos. This is called m\u0101y\u0101. Political leaders do not like to leave their political posts, and they either have to be shot by an enemy or obliged to leave by the arrival of death. By superior arrangement a living entity is offered another body, but because of his attraction to the present body, he does not like to transfer himself to another body. Thus he is forced to accept another body by the laws of nature: \u201cThe bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.\u201d (Bg. 3.27) Material nature is very strong, and the material modes force one to accept another body. This force is visible when the living entity transmigrates from a superior body to an inferior one. One who acts like a dog or hog in the present body will certainly be forced to accept the body of a dog or hog in the next life. A person may be enjoying the body of a prime minister or a president, but when he understands that he will be forced to accept the body of a dog or hog, he chooses not to leave the present body. Therefore he lies in a coma many days before death. This has been experienced by many politicians at the time of death. The conclusion is that the next body is already determined by superior control. The living entity immediately gives up the present body and enters another. Sometimes in the present body the living entity feels that many of his desires and imaginations are not fulfilled. Those who are overly attracted to their life situation are forced to remain in a ghostly body and are not allowed to accept another gross body. Even in the body of a ghost, they create disturbances for neighbors and relatives. The mind is the prime cause of such a situation. According to one\u2019s mind, different types of bodies are generated, and one is forced to accept them. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.6): \u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.\u201d Within one\u2019s body and mind, one can think as either a dog or a god, and the next life is offered to him accordingly. This is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.22): \u201cThe living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.\u201d The living entity may transmigrate to either a superior or inferior body according to his association with the modes of material nature. If he associates with the mode of ignorance, he gets the body of an animal or an inferior man, but if he associates with the mode of goodness or passion, he gets a body accordingly. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.18):"

        "translation": "The caterpillar transports itself from one leaf to another by capturing one leaf before giving up the other. Similarly, according to his previous work, the living entity must capture another body before giving up the one he has. This is because the mind is the reservoir of all kinds of desires.",
        "purport": " A living entity too much absorbed in material activity becomes very much attracted to the material body. Even at the point of death, he thinks of his present body and the relatives connected to it. Thus he remains fully absorbed in the bodily conception of life, so much so that even at the point of death he abhors leaving his present body. Sometimes it is found that a person on the verge of death remains in a coma for many days before giving up the body. This is common among so-called leaders and politicians who think that without their presence the entire country and all society will be in chaos. This is called m\u0101y\u0101. Political leaders do not like to leave their political posts, and they either have to be shot by an enemy or obliged to leave by the arrival of death. By superior arrangement a living entity is offered another body, but because of his attraction to the present body, he does not like to transfer himself to another body. Thus he is forced to accept another body by the laws of nature: \u201cThe bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.\u201d (Bg. 3.27) Material nature is very strong, and the material modes force one to accept another body. This force is visible when the living entity transmigrates from a superior body to an inferior one. One who acts like a dog or hog in the present body will certainly be forced to accept the body of a dog or hog in the next life. A person may be enjoying the body of a prime minister or a president, but when he understands that he will be forced to accept the body of a dog or hog, he chooses not to leave the present body. Therefore he lies in a coma many days before death. This has been experienced by many politicians at the time of death. The conclusion is that the next body is already determined by superior control. The living entity immediately gives up the present body and enters another. Sometimes in the present body the living entity feels that many of his desires and imaginations are not fulfilled. Those who are overly attracted to their life situation are forced to remain in a ghostly body and are not allowed to accept another gross body. Even in the body of a ghost, they create disturbances for neighbors and relatives. The mind is the prime cause of such a situation. According to one\u2019s mind, different types of bodies are generated, and one is forced to accept them. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.6): \u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.\u201d Within one\u2019s body and mind, one can think as either a dog or a god, and the next life is offered to him accordingly. This is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.22): \u201cThe living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.\u201d The living entity may transmigrate to either a superior or inferior body according to his association with the modes of material nature. If he associates with the mode of ignorance, he gets the body of an animal or an inferior man, but if he associates with the mode of goodness or passion, he gets a body accordingly. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.18): \u201cThose situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.\u201d The root cause of one\u2019s association is the mind. This great K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is the greatest boon to human society because it is teaching everyone to think always of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by executing devotional service. In this way, at the end of life one may be transferred to the association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is technically called nitya-l\u012bl\u0101-pravi\u1e63\u1e6da, entering into the planet Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55) explains: \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d After the mind is completely absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can enter the planet known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. To enter the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one has to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The process of understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is devotional service. After understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is, one can become eligible to enter K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka and associate with Him. The mind is the cause of such an exalted position. The mind can also get one a body like those of dogs and hogs. To absorb the mind always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is therefore the greatest perfection of human life."

These plans are recorded in the spool of one\u2019s mind as b\u012bja, the root of fruitive activities. In conditional life the living entity creates a series of bodies one after another, and this is called karma-bandhana.

Instead of plunging oneself into the ocean of material activity, one should accept material activity only to maintain body and soul together. The rest of one\u2019s time should be devoted to engaging in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. In this way one can attain relief from the reactions of material activity."

In the material state the living entity is on the j\u012bva-bh\u016bta platform, but when he renders devotional service to the Lord, he is elevated to the brahma-bh\u016bta platform. On the brahma-bh\u016bta platform the living entity is liberated from material bondage, and he engages in the service of the Lord. In this verse the word dh\u012bra is sometimes read as v\u012bra.

The word dh\u012bra means \u201csober,\u201d and v\u012bra means \u201chero.\u201d One who is struggling against m\u0101y\u0101 is a hero, and one who is sober enough to understand his position is a dh\u012bra.

        "purport": " As indicated in verse 79, N\u0101rada Muni advised King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi to take to devotional service rather than waste time performing ritualistic ceremonies and fruitive activities. The vivid descriptions of the subtle and gross bodies in this chapter are most scientific, and because they are given by the great sage N\u0101rada, they are authoritative. Because these narrations are full of the glory of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they constitute the most effective process for the purification of the mind. As \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu confirmed, ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam. The more we talk of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and preach for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the more we become purified. This means we no longer have to accept a hallucinatory gross and subtle body, but instead attain our spiritual identity. One who tries to understand this instructive spiritual knowledge is delivered from this ocean of nescience. The word p\u0101rame\u1e63\u1e6dhyam is very significant in this connection. P\u0101rame\u1e63\u1e6dhyam is also called Brahmaloka; it is the planet on which Lord Brahm\u0101 lives. The inhabitants of Brahmaloka always discuss such narrations so that after the annihilation of the material world they can be directly transferred to the spiritual world. One who is transferred to the spiritual world does not have to go up and down within this material world. Sometimes spiritual activities are also called p\u0101rame\u1e63\u1e6dhyam."
