Thus Indra became very pleased with Vijit\u0101\u015bva at that time.

Although in human society such activities are considered abominable, the demigod Indra was not considered to be degraded by them. Although Antardh\u0101na could understand that King Indra was stealing the horse from his father, he did not kill Indra, for he knew that if one who is very powerful sometimes commits an abominable act, it should be disregarded. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.30) it is clearly stated: Thus the Lord says that even if a devotee commits an abominable act, he should be considered a s\u0101dhu, or a pious man, because of his unflinching devotion to the Lord. The devotees of the Lord never willingly commit any sinful act, but sometimes they commit something abominable due to their previous habits. Such acts should not be taken very seriously, however, because the devotees of the Lord are very powerful, whether they are on the heavenly planets or on this planet. If by chance they commit something abominable, it should not be taken into account, but should be overlooked."

The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has started performing sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a in different places, and it has been experienced that wherever sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a is performed, many thousands of people gather and take part in it.

The members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement should perform sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1as one after another, so much so that all the people of the world will either jokingly or seriously chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, and thus they will derive the benefit of cleansing the heart. The holy name of the Lord (harer n\u0101ma) is so powerful that whether it is chanted jokingly or seriously the effect of vibrating this transcendental sound will be equally distributed. It is not possible at the present moment to perform repeated yaj\u00f1as as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Barhi\u1e63at performed, but it is within our means to perform sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, which does not cost anything.

Her bodily features were completely beautiful, and she was very young. She was decorated with the proper garments, and when she came into the marriage arena and began circumambulating it, the fire-god Agni became so attracted to her that he desired her company, exactly as he had formerly desired to enjoy \u015auk\u012b.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word su\u1e63\u1e6dhv-ala\u1e45k\u1e5bt\u0101m is significant. According to the Vedic system, when a girl is married, she is very profusely and gorgeously decorated with costly saris and jewelry, and during the marriage ceremony the bride circumambulates the bridegroom seven times. After this, the bridegroom and bride look at one another and become attracted for life. When the bridegroom finds the bride very beautiful, the attraction between them immediately becomes very strongly fixed. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, men and women are naturally attracted to one another, and when they are united by marriage that attraction becomes very strong. Being so strongly attracted, the bridegroom attempts to set up a nice homestead and eventually a good field for producing grains. Then children come, then friends, and then wealth. In this way the male becomes more and more entangled in the material conceptions of life, and he begins to think, \u201cThis is mine,\u201d and \u201cIt is I who am acting.\u201d In this way the illusion of material existence is perpetuated. The words \u015buk\u012bm iva are also significant, for the fire-god Agni became attracted by the beauty of \u015aatadruti while she was circumambulating the bridegroom Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi, just as he had previously been attracted to the beauty of \u015auk\u012b, the wife of Saptar\u1e63i. When the fire-god had been present long ago at the assembly of Saptar\u1e63i, he was attracted by the beauty of \u015auk\u012b when she was circumambulating in the same way. Agni\u2019s wife, named Sv\u0101h\u0101, took the form of \u015auk\u012b and enjoyed sex life with Agni. Not only the fire-god Agni but the heavenly god Indra and sometimes even Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva \u2014 all very highly situated demigods \u2014 are subject to being attracted by sex at any time. The sex drive is so strong in the living entities that the whole material world is running on sex attraction only, and it is due to sex attraction that one remains in the material world and is obliged to accept different types of bodies. The attraction of sex life is more clearly explained in the next verse."

        "purport": " Generally a woman becomes more beautiful when, after an early marriage, she gives birth to a child. To give birth to a child is the natural function of a woman, and therefore a woman becomes more and more beautiful as she gives birth to one child after another. In the case of \u015aatadruti, however, she was so beautiful that she attracted the whole universe at her marriage ceremony. Indeed, she attracted all the learned and exalted demigods simply by the tinkling of her ankle bells. This indicates that all the demigods wanted to see her beauty completely, but they were not able to see it because she was fully dressed and covered with ornaments. Since they could only see the feet of \u015aatadruti, they became attracted by her ankle bells, which tinkled as she walked. In other words, the demigods became captivated by her simply by hearing the tinkling of her ankle bells. They did not have to see her complete beauty. It is sometimes understood that a person becomes lusty just by hearing the tinkling of bangles on the hands of women or the tinkling of ankle bells, or just by seeing a woman\u2019s sari. Thus it is concluded that woman is the complete representation of m\u0101y\u0101. Although Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra Muni was engaged in practicing mystic yoga with closed eyes, his transcendental meditation was broken when he heard the tinkling of bangles on the hands of Menak\u0101. In this way Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra Muni became a victim of Menak\u0101 and fathered a child who is universally celebrated as \u015aakuntal\u0101. The conclusion is that no one can save himself from the attraction of woman, even though he be an exalted demigod or an inhabitant of the higher planets. Only a devotee of the Lord, who is attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can escape the lures of woman. Once one is attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the illusory energy of the world cannot attract him."

        "purport": " Sometimes great sages and ascetics enter the Him\u0101laya Mountains in order to find seclusion from the turmoil of the world. It appears, however, that all the Pracet\u0101s, the sons of Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi, entered the depths of the ocean to perform austerity in a secluded place. Since they performed austerities for ten thousand years, this incident took place in the Satya-yuga, when people used to live for a hundred thousand years. It is also significant that by their austerity they worshiped the master of austerity, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one wants to perform austerities and penances in order to attain the supreme goal, one must attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one achieves the favor of the Supreme Lord, it is to be understood that he has finished all kinds of austerities and penances and has attained efficiency in their execution. On the other hand, if one does not attain the perfect stage of devotional service, all austerities and penances actually have no meaning, for without the Supreme Lord no one can attain the highest results derived from performing them. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29), Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all penances and sacrifices (bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram). Thus the desired result of performing austerities may be derived from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.33.7) it is stated: Even if a person is born in a family of ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las  \u2014 the lowest birth one can get in human society \u2014 he is glorious if he chants the holy names of the Lord, for it is to be understood that by such chanting a devotee definitely proves that he underwent all kinds of austerities in his previous life. By the grace of Lord Caitanya, one who chants the mah\u0101-mantra \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 attains the highest perfectional stage, which had previously been attained by people who entered the ocean and executed austerities for ten thousand years. In this Age of Kali, if a person does not take advantage of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, which is offered as a great concession to the fallen human beings of this age, it is to be understood that he is very much bewildered by the illusory energy of the Lord."

Lord \u015aiva actually became the spiritual master of the ten sons, and in turn his disciples took his words so seriously that simply by meditating upon his instructions (dhy\u0101yanta\u1e25) they became perfect. This is the secret of success. After being initiated and receiving the orders of the spiritual master, the disciple should unhesitatingly think about the instructions or orders of the spiritual master and should not allow himself to be disturbed by anything else. This is also the verdict of \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, who, while explaining the verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 beginning vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101 buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana (Bg. 2.41), points out that the order of the spiritual master is the life substance of the disciple. The disciple should not consider whether he is going back home, back to Godhead; his first business should be to execute the order of his spiritual master. Thus a disciple should always meditate on the order of the spiritual master, and that is perfectional meditation. Not only should he meditate upon that order, but he should find out the means by which he can perfectly worship and execute it."

Even great sages who have no material attachments do not contact him, despite their always being absorbed in meditation to attain his personal contact.",
        "purport": " Since Lord \u015aiva does not incarnate himself unless there is some special reason, it is very difficult for an ordinary person to contact him. However, Lord \u015aiva does descend on a special occasion when he is ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard, it is stated in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a that Lord \u015aiva appeared as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in the Age of Kali to preach the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy, which is nothing but a type of Buddhist philosophy. It is stated in Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: Lord \u015aiva, speaking to P\u0101rvat\u012b-dev\u012b, foretold that he would spread the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy in the guise of a sanny\u0101s\u012b br\u0101hma\u1e47a just to eradicate Buddhist philosophy. This sanny\u0101s\u012b was \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya. In order to overcome the effects of Buddhist philosophy and spread Ved\u0101nta philosophy, \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya had to make some compromise with the Buddhist philosophy, and as such he preached the philosophy of monism, for it was required at that time. Otherwise there was no need for his preaching M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy. At the present moment there is no need for M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy or Buddhist philosophy, and Lord Caitanya rejected both of them. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is spreading the philosophy of Lord Caitanya and rejecting the philosophy of both classes of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b. Strictly speaking, both Buddhist philosophy and \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s philosophy are but different types of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da dealing on the platform of material existence. Neither of these philosophies has spiritual significance. There is spiritual significance only after one accepts the philosophy of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which culminates in surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally people worship Lord \u015aiva for some material benefit, and although they cannot see him personally, they derive great material profit by worshiping him."

        "translation": "Lord \u015aiva, the most powerful demigod, second only to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is self-sufficient. Although he has nothing to aspire for in the material world, for the benefit of those in the material world he is always busily engaged everywhere and is accompanied by his dangerous energies like the goddess K\u0101l\u012b and the goddess Durg\u0101.",
        "purport": " Lord \u015aiva is known as the greatest devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is known as the best of all types of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas (vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 yath\u0101 \u015bambhu\u1e25). Consequently, Lord \u015aiva has a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava samprad\u0101ya, the disciplic succession known as the Rudra samprad\u0101ya. Just as there is a Brahma samprad\u0101ya coming directly from Lord Brahm\u0101, the Rudra samprad\u0101ya comes directly from Lord \u015aiva. Lord \u015aiva is one of the twelve great personalities, as stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (6.3.20): These are twelve great authorities in preaching God consciousness. The name \u015aambhu means Lord \u015aiva. His disciplic succession is also known as the Vi\u1e63\u1e47usv\u0101mi samprad\u0101ya, and the current Vi\u1e63\u1e47usv\u0101mi samprad\u0101ya is also known as the Vallabha samprad\u0101ya. The current Brahma samprad\u0101ya is known as the Madhva-Gau\u1e0d\u012bya samprad\u0101ya. Even though Lord \u015aiva appeared to preach M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy, at the end of his pastimes in the form of \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya he preached the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy: bhaja govinda\u1e41 bhaja govinda\u1e41 bhaja govinda\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dha-mate. He stressed worshiping Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Govinda, three times in this verse and especially warned his followers that they could not possibly achieve deliverance, or mukti, simply by word jugglery and grammatical puzzles. If one is actually serious to attain mukti, he must worship Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s last instruction. Herein it is mentioned that Lord \u015aiva is always accompanied by his material energy (\u015bakty\u0101 ghoray\u0101). Material energy \u2014 goddess Durg\u0101, or goddess K\u0101l\u012b \u2014 is always under his control. Goddess K\u0101l\u012b and Durg\u0101 serve him by killing all the asuras, or demons. Sometimes K\u0101l\u012b becomes so infuriated that she indiscriminately kills all kinds of asuras. There is a popular picture of goddess K\u0101l\u012b in which she wears a garland composed of the heads of the asuras and holds in her left hand a captured head and in her right hand a great kha\u1e0dga, or chopper, for killing asuras. Great wars are symbolic representations of K\u0101l\u012b\u2019s devastation of the asuras and are actually conducted by the goddess K\u0101l\u012b: (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.44) Asuras try to pacify the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, or Durg\u0101, by worshiping her in material opulence, but when the asuras become too intolerable, the goddess K\u0101l\u012b does not discriminate in killing them wholesale. Asuras do not know the secret of the energy of Lord \u015aiva, and they prefer to worship the goddess K\u0101l\u012b or Durg\u0101 or Lord \u015aiva for material benefit. Due to their demoniac character, they are reluctant to surrender to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as indicated by Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.15): Lord \u015aiva\u2019s duty is very dangerous because he has to employ the energy of the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, or Durg\u0101. In another popular picture the goddess K\u0101l\u012b is sometimes seen standing on the prostrate body of Lord \u015aiva, which indicates that sometimes Lord \u015aiva has to fall down flat in order to stop the goddess K\u0101l\u012b from killing the asuras. Since Lord \u015aiva controls the great material energy (the goddess Durg\u0101), worshipers of Lord \u015aiva attain very opulent positions within this material world. Under Lord \u015aiva\u2019s direction, a worshiper of Lord \u015aiva gets all kinds of material facilities. In contrast, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or worshiper of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, gradually becomes poorer in material possessions because Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u does not trick His devotees into becoming materially entangled by possessions. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u gives His devotees intelligence from within, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d Thus Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u gives intelligence to His devotee so that the devotee can make progress on the path back home, back to Godhead. Since a devotee has nothing to do with any kind of material possession, he does not come under the control of the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, or the goddess Durg\u0101. Lord \u015aiva is also in charge of the tamo-gu\u1e47a, or the mode of ignorance in this material world. His potency, the goddess Durg\u0101, is described as keeping all living entities in the darkness of ignorance (y\u0101 dev\u012b sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u nidra-r\u016bpa\u1e41 sa\u1e41sthit\u0101). Both Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva are incarnations of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but Lord Brahm\u0101 is in charge of the creation whereas Lord \u015aiva is in charge of the destruction, which he carries out with the help of his material energy, goddess K\u0101l\u012b, or goddess Durg\u0101. Thus in this verse Lord \u015aiva is described as being accompanied by dangerous potencies (\u015bakty\u0101 ghoray\u0101), and that is the actual position of Lord \u015aiva."

The water of this lake was so calm and quiet that it seemed like the mind of a great soul, and its inhabitants, the aquatics, appeared very peaceful and happy to be under the protection of such a watery reservoir.",
        "purport": " The word sa-samudra means \u201cnear the sea.\u201d The reservoir of water was like a bay, for it was not very far from the sea. The word upa, meaning \u201cmore or less,\u201d is used in many ways, as in the word upapati, which indicates a husband \u201cmore or less,\u201d that is to say, a lover who is acting like a husband. Upa also means \u201cgreater,\u201d \u201csmaller\u201d or \u201cnearer.\u201d Considering all these points, the reservoir of water which was seen by the Pracet\u0101s while they were traveling was actually a large bay or lake. And unlike the sea or ocean, which has turbulent waves, this reservoir was very calm and quiet. Indeed, the water was so clear that it seemed like the mind of some great soul. There may be many great souls \u2014 j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, yog\u012bs and bhaktas, or pure devotees, are also called great souls \u2014 but they are very rarely found. One can find many great souls amongst yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, but a truly great soul, a pure devotee of the Lord, who is fully surrendered to the Lord, is very rarely found (sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25, Bg. 7.19). A devotee\u2019s mind is always calm, quiet and desireless because he is always any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam, having no desire other than to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as His personal servant, friend, father, mother or conjugal lover. Due to his association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, a devotee is always very calm and cool. It is also significant that within that reservoir all the aquatics were also very calm and quiet. Because the disciples of a devotee have taken shelter of a great soul, they become very calm and quiet and are not agitated by the waves of the material world. This material world is often described as an ocean of nescience. In such an ocean, everything is agitated. The mind of a great devotee is also like an ocean or a very large lake, but there is no agitation. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.41), vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101 buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana: those who are fixed in the service of the Lord are not agitated by anything. It is also stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.22), yasmin sthito na du\u1e25khena guru\u1e47\u0101pi vic\u0101lyate: even if he suffers some reversals in life, a devotee is never agitated. Therefore whoever takes shelter of a great soul, or a great devotee, becomes pacified. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 19.149) it is stated, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-bhakta \u2014 ni\u1e63k\u0101ma, ataeva\u00a0\u2018\u015b\u0101nta\u2019: a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always peaceful because he has no desire, whereas the yog\u012bs, karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs have so many desires to fulfill. One may argue that the devotees have desires, for they wish to go home, back to Godhead, but such a desire does not agitate the mind. Although he wishes to go back to Godhead, a devotee is satisfied in any condition of life. Consequently, the word mahan-mana\u1e25 is used in this verse to indicate that the reservoir of water was as calm and quiet as the mind of a great devotee."

        "purport": " The word \u0101karam, \u201cmine,\u201d is significant in this verse, for the reservoir of water appeared like a mine from which different types of lotus flowers were produced. Some of the lotus flowers grew during the day, some at night and some in the evening, and accordingly they had different names and different colors. All these flowers were present on that lake, and because the lake was so calm and quiet and filled with lotus flowers, superior birds, like swans, cakrav\u0101kas and k\u0101ra\u1e47\u1e0davas, stood on the shores and vibrated their different songs, making the entire scene attractive and beautiful. As there are different types of human beings, according to the association of the three qualities of material nature, there are similarly different types of birds, bees, trees, etc. Everything is divided according to the three qualities of material nature. Birds like swans and cranes, who enjoy clear waters and lotus flowers, are different from crows, who enjoy filthy places. Similarly, there are persons who are controlled by the modes of ignorance and passion and those who are controlled by the mode of goodness. The creation is so varied that there are always varieties found in every society. Thus on the bank of this lake all the superior birds lived to enjoy that atmosphere created by that great reservoir filled with lotus flowers."

They are very expert in musical science, and Lord \u015aiva is worshiped by them constantly. In pictures, Lord \u015aiva is generally painted white, but here we find that the color of his skin is not exactly white but like molten gold, or a glowing yellowish color. Because Lord \u015aiva is always very, very merciful, his name is \u0100\u015buto\u1e63a. Amongst all the demigods, Lord \u015aiva can be pacified even by the lowest class of men, who need only offer him obeisances and leaves of a bael tree. Thus his name is \u0100\u015buto\u1e63a, which means that he is pleased very quickly. Generally those who are very fond of material prosperity approach Lord \u015aiva for such benediction. The lord, being very merciful, quickly awards all the blessings the devotee asks of him. The demons take advantage of this leniency and sometimes take benedictions from Lord \u015aiva which can be very dangerous to others. For instance, V\u1e5bk\u0101sura took a benediction from Lord \u015aiva by which he could kill everyone he touched on the head. Although Lord \u015aiva sometimes very liberally gives such benedictions to his devotees, the difficulty is that the demons, being very cunning, sometimes want to experiment improperly with such benedictions. For instance, after receiving his benediction, V\u1e5bk\u0101sura tried to touch the head of Lord \u015aiva. Devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, however, have no desire for such benedictions, and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u does not give His devotees benedictions which would cause disturbance to the whole world."

        "purport": " By these words Lord \u015aiva indicates that what the princes were going to do was known to him. It is a fact that they were going to worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u by severe austerities and penances. Knowing this fact, Lord \u015aiva immediately became very pleased, as apparent by the next verse. This indicates that a person who is not yet a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead but who desires to serve the Supreme Lord receives the benedictions of the demigods, headed by the chief demigod, Lord \u015aiva. Thus a devotee of the Lord does not need to try to please the demigods separately. Simply by worshiping the Supreme Lord, a devotee can please all of them. Nor does he have to ask the demigods for material benedictions, for the demigods, being pleased with the devotee, automatically offer him everything that he needs. The demigods are servants of the Lord, and they are always prepared to help a devotee in all circumstances. Therefore \u015ar\u012bla Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura said that if one has unalloyed devotion for the Supreme Lord, the goddess of liberation is ready to serve him, to say nothing of the gods of material opulences. Indeed, all the demigods are simply waiting for an opportunity to serve the devotee. Thus there is no need for a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to endeavor for material opulence or liberation. By being situated in the transcendental position of devotional service, he receives all the benefits of dharma, artha, k\u0101ma and mok\u1e63a."

        "purport": " Now Lord \u015aiva explains the reason he has personally come before the princes. It is because all the princes are devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19): \u201cAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.\u201d Lord \u015aiva is rarely seen by common men, and similarly a person who is fully surrendered unto V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is also very rarely seen because a person who is fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord is very rare (sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25). Consequently, Lord \u015aiva came especially to see the Pracet\u0101s because they were fully surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva. V\u0101sudeva is also mentioned in the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam in the mantra o\u1e41 namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya. Since V\u0101sudeva is the ultimate truth, Lord \u015aiva openly proclaims that one who is a devotee of Lord V\u0101sudeva, who is surrendered to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is actually very dear to him. Lord V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is worshipable not only by ordinary living entities but by demigods like Lord \u015aiva, Lord Brahm\u0101 and others. Ya\u1e41 brahm\u0101-varu\u1e47endra-rudra-maruta\u1e25 stunvanti divyai\u1e25 stavai\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 12.13.1): K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshiped by Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, Varu\u1e47a, Indra, Candra and all other demigods. That is also the situation with a devotee. Indeed, one who takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness immediately becomes very dear to anyone who is simply finding out and beginning to understand what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness actually is. Similarly, all the demigods are also trying to find out who is actually surrendered to Lord V\u0101sudeva. Because the Pracet\u0101 princes were surrendered to V\u0101sudeva, Lord \u015aiva willingly came forth to see them. Lord V\u0101sudeva, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as Puru\u1e63ottama. Actually He is the enjoyer (puru\u1e63a) and the Supreme (uttama) as well. He is the enjoyer of everything \u2014 the prak\u1e5bti and the puru\u1e63a. Being influenced by the three modes of material nature, the living entity tries to dominate material nature, but actually he is not the puru\u1e63a (enjoyer) but prak\u1e5bti, as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.5): apareyam itas tv any\u0101\u1e41 prak\u1e5bti\u1e41 viddhi me par\u0101m. Thus the j\u012bva, or living entity, is actually prak\u1e5bti, or the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. Being associated with material energy, he tries to lord it over the material nature. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7): \u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\u201d By endeavoring to dominate material nature, the living entity simply struggles hard for existence. Indeed, he struggles so hard to enjoy himself that he cannot even enjoy the material resources. Thus he is sometimes called prak\u1e5bti, or j\u012bva, for he is situated in the marginal potency. When the living entity is covered with the three modes of material nature, he is called j\u012bva-sa\u1e41j\u00f1ita. There are two kinds of living entities: one is called k\u1e63ara, and the other is ak\u1e63ara. K\u1e63ara refers to those who have fallen down and become conditioned, and ak\u1e63ara refers to those who are not conditioned. The vast majority of living entities live in the spiritual world and are called ak\u1e63ara \u2014 they are in the position of Brahman, pure spiritual existence. They are different from those who have been conditioned by the three modes of material nature. Being above both the k\u1e63ara and ak\u1e63ara, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.18) as Puru\u1e63ottama. The impersonalists may say that V\u0101sudeva is the impersonal Brahman, but actually the impersonal Brahman is subordinate to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.27): brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham. That K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of the impersonal Brahman is also confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.40): yasya prabh\u0101 prabhavato jagada\u1e47\u1e0da-ko\u1e6di. The impersonal Brahman is nothing but the effulgence or bodily rays of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and in those bodily rays there are innumerable universes floating. Thus in all respects V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the Supreme Lord, and Lord \u015aiva is very satisfied with those who are completely surrendered to Him. Complete surrender is desired by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as He indicates in the last chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. The word s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t, meaning \u201cdirectly,\u201d is very significant. There are many so-called devotees, but actually they are only karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, for they are not directly devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The karm\u012bs sometimes offer the results of their activities to Lord V\u0101sudeva, and this offering is called karm\u0101rpa\u1e47am. These are considered to be fruitive activities, for the karm\u012bs consider Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to be one of the demigods like Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. Because they consider Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to be on the same level with the demigods, they contend that surrendering to the demigods is as good as surrendering unto V\u0101sudeva. This contention is denied herein because if it were true, Lord \u015aiva would have said that surrender unto him, Lord V\u0101sudeva, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or Brahm\u0101 is the same. However, Lord \u015aiva does not say this because he himself surrenders unto V\u0101sudeva, and whoever else surrenders unto V\u0101sudeva is very, very dear to him. This is expressed herein openly. The conclusion is that a devotee of Lord \u015aiva is not dear to Lord \u015aiva, but a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very dear to Lord \u015aiva."

        "purport": " This verse gives an idea of the highest perfection of the evolutionary process. As described by the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava poet Jayadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, pralaya-payodhi-jale dh\u1e5btav\u0101n asi vedam. Let us begin tracing the evolutionary process from the point of devastation (pralaya), when the whole universe is filled with water. At that time there are many fishes and other aquatics, and from these aquatics evolve creepers, trees, etc. From these, insects and reptiles evolve, and from them, birds, beasts and then human beings and finally civilized human beings. Now, the civilized human being is at a junction where he can make further evolutionary progress in spiritual life. Here it is stated (sva-dharma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e25) that when a living entity comes to a civilized form of life, there must be sva-dharma, social divisions according to one\u2019s work and qualifications. This is indicated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13): \u201cAccording to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.\u201d In civilized human society there must be the divisions of br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra, and everyone must properly execute his occupational duty in accordance with his division. Here it is described (sva-dharma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e25) that it does not matter whether one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra. If one sticks to his position and properly executes his particular duty, he is considered a civilized human being. Otherwise he is no better than an animal. It is also mentioned herein that whoever executes his occupational duty (sva-dharma) for one hundred births (for instance, if a br\u0101hma\u1e47a continues to act as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a) becomes eligible for promotion to Brahmaloka, the planet where Lord Brahm\u0101 lives. There is also a planet called \u015aivaloka, or Sad\u0101\u015bivaloka, which is situated in a marginal position between the spiritual and material worlds. If, after being situated in Brahmaloka, one becomes more qualified, he is promoted to Sad\u0101\u015bivaloka. Similarly, when one becomes even more qualified, he can attain the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas. The Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas are targets for everyone, even the demigods, and they can be attained by a devotee who has no desire for material benefit. As indicated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.16), one does not escape material miseries even if he is elevated to Brahmaloka (\u0101brahma-bhuvan\u0101l lok\u0101\u1e25 punar \u0101vartino\u00a0\u2019rjuna). Similarly, one is not very safe even if he is promoted to \u015aivaloka, because the planet of \u015aivaloka is marginal. However, if one attains Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, he attains the highest perfection of life and the end of the evolutionary process (m\u0101m upetya tu kaunteya punar janma na vidyate). In other words, it is confirmed herein that a person in human society who has developed consciousness must take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in order to be promoted to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka immediately after leaving the body. Tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so\u00a0\u2019rjuna (Bg. 4.9). A devotee who is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who is not attracted by any other loka, or planet, including Brahmaloka and \u015aivaloka, is immediately transferred to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka (m\u0101m eti). That is the highest perfection of life and the perfection of the evolutionary process."

        "translation": "You are all devotees of the Lord, and as such I appreciate that you are as respectable as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. I know in this way that the devotees also respect me and that I am dear to them. Thus no one can be as dear to the devotees as I am.",
        "purport": " It is said, vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 yath\u0101 \u015bambhu\u1e25: Lord \u015aiva is the best of all devotees. Therefore all devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are also devotees of Lord \u015aiva. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana there is Lord \u015aiva\u2019s temple called Gop\u012b\u015bvara. The gop\u012bs used to worship not only Lord \u015aiva but K\u0101ty\u0101yan\u012b, or Durg\u0101, as well, but their aim was to attain the favor of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not disrespect Lord \u015aiva, but worships Lord \u015aiva as the most exalted devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Consequently whenever a devotee worships Lord \u015aiva, he prays to Lord \u015aiva to achieve the favor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he does not request material profit. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20) it is said that generally people worship demigods for some material profit (k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante \u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25). Driven by material lust, they worship demigods. But a devotee never does so, for he is never driven by material lust. That is the difference between a devotee\u2019s respect for Lord \u015aiva and an asura\u2019s respect for him. The asura worships Lord \u015aiva, takes some benediction from him, misuses the benediction, and ultimately is killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who awards him liberation. Because Lord \u015aiva is a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he loves all the devotees of the Supreme Lord. Lord \u015aiva told the Pracet\u0101s that because they were devotees of the Lord, he loved them very much. Lord \u015aiva was not kind and merciful only to the Pracet\u0101s; anyone who is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear to Lord \u015aiva. Not only are the devotees dear to Lord \u015aiva, but he respects them as much as he respects the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, devotees of the Supreme Lord also worship Lord \u015aiva as the most dear devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They do not worship him as a separate Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the list of n\u0101ma-apar\u0101dhas that it is an offense to think that the chanting of the name of Hari and the chanting of Hara, or \u015aiva, are the same. The devotees must always know that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that Lord \u015aiva is His devotee. A devotee should be offered respect on the level of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and sometimes even more respect. Indeed, Lord R\u0101ma, the Personality of Godhead Himself, sometimes worshiped Lord \u015aiva. If a devotee is worshiped by the Lord, why should a devotee not be worshiped by other devotees on the same level with the Lord? This is the conclusion. From this verse it appears that Lord \u015aiva blesses the asuras simply for the sake of formality. Actually he loves one who is devoted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

You are the most exalted of all self-realized souls. Since You are always auspicious for the self-realized, I wish that You be auspicious for me. You are worshipable by virtue of the all-perfect instructions You give. You are the Supersoul; therefore I offer my obeisances unto You as the supreme living being.",
        "purport": " As soon as a devotee is inspired by the Lord to offer the Lord a prayer, the devotee immediately glorifies the Lord in the beginning by saying, \u201cAll glories unto You, my Lord.\u201d The Lord is glorified because He is considered to be the chief of all self-realized souls. As said in the Vedas (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13), nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m: the Supreme Being, the Personality of Godhead, is the chief living being amongst all living beings. There are different kinds of individual living beings \u2014 some of them are in this material world, and some are in the spiritual world. Those who are in the spiritual world are known to be completely self-realized because on the spiritual platform the living entity is not forgetful of his service to the Lord. Therefore in the spiritual world all those who are in the devotional service of the Lord are eternally fixed, for they understand the position of the Supreme Being, as well as their individual constitution. Thus amongst self-realized souls, the Lord is known as the perfectly self-realized soul (nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m). When the individual soul is fixed in his knowledge of the Lord as the Supreme Being, he actually becomes established in an all-auspicious position. Lord \u015aiva prays herein that his auspicious position continue eternally by virtue of the Lord\u2019s mercy upon him. The Supreme Lord is all-perfect, and the Lord instructs that one who worships Him also becomes perfect. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca. The Lord is situated as the Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart, but He is so kind to His devotees that He gives them instructions by which they may continue to progress. When they receive instructions from the all-perfect, there is no chance of their being misled. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): dad\u0101mi buddhi-yoga\u1e41 ta\u1e41 yena m\u0101m upay\u0101nti te. The Lord is always ready to give instructions to the pure devotee so that the devotee can advance further and further in devotional service. Since the Lord gives instructions as sarv\u0101tm\u0101, the Supersoul, Lord \u015aiva offers Him respect with the words sarvasm\u0101 \u0101tmane nama\u1e25. The individual soul is called \u0101tm\u0101, and the Lord is also called \u0101tm\u0101 as well as Param\u0101tm\u0101. Being situated in everyone\u2019s heart, the Lord is known as the supreme \u0101tm\u0101. Therefore all obeisances are offered unto Him. In this regard, one may refer to the prayers of Kunt\u012b in the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.8.20): The Lord is always ready to give instructions to the paramaha\u1e41sas, or the topmost devotees of the Lord, who are completely liberated from all contaminations of the material world. The Lord always gives instructions to such exalted devotees to inform them how they can remain fixed in devotional service. Similarly, it is stated in the \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma verse (Bh\u0101g. 1.7.10): The word \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma refers to those who are not interested in the material world but are simply engaged in spiritual realization. Such self-realized persons are generally considered in two categories \u2014 impersonal and personal. However, impersonalists also become devotees when they are attracted by the personal transcendental qualities of the Lord. The conclusion is that Lord \u015aiva wanted to remain a fixed devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva. As explained in the following verses, Lord \u015aiva never desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme Lord like the impersonalists. Rather, he thinks that it would be good fortune for him to continue to be fixed in the understanding of the Lord as the Supreme Being. By this understanding, one realizes that all living entities \u2014 including Lord \u015aiva, Lord Brahm\u0101 and other demigods \u2014 are servants of the Supreme Lord."

You are most peaceful, and because of Your self-illuminated existence, You are not disturbed by the six kinds of transformations.",
        "purport": " The Lord as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u lies in the ocean of Garbha within this universe, and from His navel the lotus flower sprouts. Lord Brahm\u0101 is generated from that lotus flower, and from Lord Brahm\u0101 the creation of this material world begins. As such, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is the origin of the material senses and sense objects. Since Lord \u015aiva considers himself to be one of the products of the material world, his senses are under the control of the supreme creator. The Supreme Lord is also known as H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, master of the senses, which indicates that our senses and sense objects are formed by the Supreme Lord. As such, He can control our senses and out of His mercy engage them in the service of the master of the senses. In the conditioned state, the living entity struggles in this material world and engages his senses for material satisfaction. However, if the living entity is graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can engage these very senses in the service of the Lord. Lord \u015aiva desires not to be misled by the material senses but to engage always in the service of the Lord without being subject to contamination by materialistic influences. By the grace and help of Lord V\u0101sudeva, who is all-pervading, one can engage his senses in devotional service without deviation, just as the Lord acts without deviation. The words \u015b\u0101nt\u0101ya k\u016b\u1e6da-sth\u0101ya sva-roci\u1e63e are very significant. Although the Lord is within this material world, He is not disturbed by the waves of material existence. However, conditioned souls are agitated by six kinds of transformations; namely, they become agitated when they are hungry, when they are thirsty, when they are aggrieved, when they are illusioned, when they grow old and when they are on the deathbed. Although conditioned souls become very easily illusioned by these conditions in the material world, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the Supersoul, V\u0101sudeva, is never agitated by these transformations. Therefore it is said here (k\u016b\u1e6da-sth\u0101ya) that He is always peaceful and devoid of agitation because of His prowess, which is described herein as sva-roci\u1e63e, indicating that He is illuminated by His own transcendental position. In other words, the individual soul, although within the illumination of the Supreme, sometimes falls down from that illumination because of his tiny position, and when he falls down he enters into material, conditional life. The Lord, however, is not subject to such conditioning; therefore He is described as self-illuminated. Consequently, any conditioned soul within this material universe can remain completely perfect when he is under the protection of V\u0101sudeva, or when he is engaged in devotional service."

The master of integration is also the destroyer of this world by virtue of His disintegrating energy. Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a is the master of integration and disintegration, whereas Pradyumna, another feature of Lord V\u0101sudeva, is responsible for universal growth and maintenance. The word s\u016bk\u1e63m\u0101ya is significant because within this gross material body there are subtle material bodies, namely mind, intelligence and ego. The Lord in His different features \u2014 V\u0101sudeva, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a \u2014 maintains both the gross and subtle material elements of this world.

All of them are controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as V\u0101sudeva, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, and this will be further explained in the following verse."

In order to execute devotional service, one has to fix his mind on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore Lord \u015aiva prays to the controller of the mind, Lord Aniruddha, to be pleased to help him engage his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.34), man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru. The mind has to be engaged in meditation on the lotus feet of the Lord in order to execute devotional service.

Thus if Lord Aniruddha is pleased, He can help the mind engage in the service of the Lord. It is also indicated in this verse that Lord Aniruddha is the sun-god by virtue of His expansions. Since the predominating deity of the sun is an expansion of Lord Aniruddha, Lord \u015aiva also prays to the sun-god in this verse. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by His quadruple expansion \u2014 V\u0101sudeva, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha \u2014 is the Lord of psychic action, namely thinking, feeling, willing and acting. Lord \u015aiva prays to Lord Aniruddha as the sun-god, who is the controlling deity of the external material elements which constitute the construction of the material body. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the word paramaha\u1e41sa is also another name for the sun-god. The sun-god is addressed herein as nibh\u1e5bt\u0101tmane, which indicates that he always maintains the various planets by manipulating the rainfall. The sun-god evaporates water from the seas and oceans and then forms the water into clouds and distributes it over land. When there is sufficient rainfall grains are produced, and these grains maintain living entities in each and every planet. The sun-god is also addressed herein as p\u016br\u1e47a, or complete, because the rays emanating from the sun have no end. For millions and millions of years since the creation of this universe, the sun-god has been supplying heat and light without diminution. The word paramaha\u1e41sa is applied to persons who are completely cleansed. When there is sufficient sunshine, the mind remains clear and transparent \u2014 in other words, the sun-god helps the mind of the living entity to become situated on the platform of paramaha\u1e41sa. Thus Lord \u015aiva prays to Aniruddha to be kind upon him so that his mind will always be in the perfect state of cleanliness and will be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. Just as fire sterilizes all unclean things, the sun-god also keeps everything sterilized, especially dirty things within the mind, thus enabling one to attain elevation to the platform of spiritual understanding."

        "purport": " As the individual body of the living entity is composed of millions of cells, germs and microbes, the universal body of the Supreme Lord similarly contains all the individual bodies of the living entities. Lord \u015aiva is offering his obeisances to the universal body, which includes all other bodies, so that everyone\u2019s body may fully engage in devotional service. Since this individual body is composed of senses, all the senses should be engaged in devotional service. For instance, the smelling instrument, the nose, can engage in smelling the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, the hands can engage in cleansing the temple of the Lord, etc. Indeed, being the life air of every living entity, the Lord is the maintainer of the three worlds. Consequently He can induce every living entity to engage in his real life\u2019s duty with full bodily and mental strength. Thus every living entity should serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his pr\u0101\u1e47a (life), artha (wealth), intelligence and words. As stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.22.35): Even though one may desire to engage in the service of the Lord, without sanction one cannot do so. Lord \u015aiva is offering his prayers in so many different ways in order to show living entities how to engage in the devotional service of the Lord."

You are the all-pervading sky within and without, and You are the ultimate goal of pious activities executed both within this material world and beyond it. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances again and again unto You.",
        "purport": " Vedic evidence is called \u015babda-brahma. There are many things which are beyond the perception of our imperfect senses, yet the authoritative evidence of sound vibration is perfect. The Vedas are known as \u015babda-brahma because evidence taken from the Vedas constitutes the ultimate understanding. This is because \u015babda-brahma, or the Vedas, represents the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, the real essence of \u015babda-brahma is the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. By vibrating this transcendental sound, the meaning of everything, both material and spiritual, is revealed. This Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead. The meaning of everything is received through the air through sound vibration. The vibration may be material or spiritual, but without sound vibration no one can understand the meaning of anything. In the Vedas it is said, antar bahi\u015b ca tat sarva\u1e41 vy\u0101pya n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 sthita\u1e25: \u201cN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is all-pervading, and He exists both within and without.\u201d This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.34): \u201cO son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so do the living entity and the Supersoul illuminate the entire body by consciousness.\u201d In other words, the consciousness of both the soul and Supersoul is all-pervading; the limited consciousness of the living entity is pervading the entire material body, and the supreme consciousness of the Lord is pervading the entire universe. Because the soul is present within the body, consciousness pervades the entire body; similarly, because the supreme soul, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is present within this universe, everything is working in order. May\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram: \u201cThis material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt\u012b, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings.\u201d (Bg. 9.10) Lord \u015aiva is therefore praying to the Personality of Godhead to be kind to us so that simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra we can understand everything in both the material and spiritual worlds. The word amu\u1e63mai is significant in this regard because it indicates the best target one can aim for after attaining the higher planetary systems. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities (karm\u012bs) attain the higher planetary systems as a result of their past activities, and the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, who seek unification or a monistic merging with the effulgence of the Supreme Lord, also attain their desired end, but in the ultimate issue, the devotees, who desire to personally associate with the Lord, are promoted to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas or Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. The Lord is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.12) as pavitra\u1e41 paramam, the supreme pure. This is also confirmed in this verse. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated that the cowherd boys who played with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were not ordinary living entities. Only after accumulating many pious activities in various births does one get the opportunity to personally associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since only the pure can reach Him, He is the supreme pure."

You are the master of all the worlds\u2019 metaphysical philosophy, for You are the supreme cause of all causes, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. You are the greatest of all religious principles, the supreme mind, and You have a brain which is never checked by any condition. Therefore I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto You.",
        "purport": " The words k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ya aku\u1e47\u1e6dha-medhase are significant in this verse. Modern scientists have stopped their brainwork by discovering the theory of uncertainty, but factually for a living being there cannot be any brain activity which is not checked by time and space limitations. A living entity is called a\u1e47u, an atomic particle of the supreme soul, and therefore his brain is also atomic. It cannot accommodate unlimited knowledge. This does not mean, however, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has a limited brain. What K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says and does is not limited by time and space. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.26) the Lord says: \u201cO Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows everything, but one cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without being favored by Him. Thus for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His representative there is no question of a theory of uncertainty. What K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says is all perfect and certain and is applicable to the past, present and future. Nor is there any uncertainty for one who knows exactly what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is based on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is, as spoken by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and for those who are engaged in this movement, there is no question of uncertainty. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also addressed herein as \u0101\u015bi\u1e63\u0101m \u012b\u015ba. The great saintly personalities, sages and demigods are able to offer benedictions to ordinary living entities, but they in turn are benedicted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without being benedicted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot offer benediction to anyone else. The word manave, meaning \u201cunto the supreme Manu,\u201d is also significant. The supreme Manu in Vedic literature is Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, who is an incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All the Manus are empowered incarnations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (manvantara-avat\u0101ra). There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahm\u0101, 420 in one month, 5,040 in one year, and 504,000 Manus in the lifetime of Brahm\u0101. Since all the Manus are directors of human society, ultimately K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme director of human society. In another sense, the word manave indicates the perfection of all kinds of mantras. The mantra delivers the conditioned soul from his bondage; so simply by chanting the mantra Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, one can gain deliverance from any condition. K\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101tmane: everything has a cause. The theory of chance is repudiated in this verse. Because everything has its cause, there is no question of chance. Because so-called philosophers and scientists are unable to find the real cause, they foolishly say that everything happens by chance. In Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as the cause of all causes; therefore He is addressed herein as k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101tmane. His very personality is the original cause of everything, the root of everything, and the seed of everything. As described in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (1.1.2), janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25: the Absolute Truth is the supreme cause of all emanations. The word s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoge\u015bvar\u0101ya is also significant herein, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as Yoge\u015bvara, the master of all mystic powers. Without possessing inconceivable mystic powers, one cannot be accepted as God. In this Age of Kali, those who have a little fragmental portion of mystic power claim to be God, but such pseudo Gods can only be accepted as fools, for only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Person who possesses all mystic and yogic perfections. The s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga system popular at the present moment was propounded by the atheist Kapila, but the original s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga system was propounded by an incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also named Kapila, the son of Devah\u016bti. Similarly, Datt\u0101treya, another incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, also explained the s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga system. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga systems and mystic yoga powers. The words puru\u1e63\u0101ya pur\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya are also worthy of special attention. In Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is accepted as the \u0101di-puru\u1e63a, the original person, or the original enjoyer. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also accepted as pur\u0101\u1e47a-puru\u1e63a, the oldest person. Although He is the oldest of all personalities, He is also the youngest of all, or nava-yauvana. Another significant word is dharm\u0101ya. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original propounder of all kinds of religious principles, it is said, dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam (Bh\u0101g. 6.3.19). No one can introduce a new type of religion, for religion is already there, having been established by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a informs us of the original dharma and asks us to give up all kinds of religious principles. The real dharma is surrender unto Him. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, it is also said: The purport is that one who has studied the Vedas perfectly, who is a perfect vipra, or knower of the Vedas, who knows what spiritual life actually is, speaks about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Person, as one\u2019s san\u0101tana-dharma. Lord \u015aiva therefore teaches us the principles of san\u0101tana-dharma."

        "purport": " Everyone acts under the dictation of the ego. Therefore Lord \u015aiva is trying to purify false egotism through the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since Lord \u015aiva, or Rudra, is himself the controller of egotism, he indirectly wants to be purified by the mercy of the Lord so that his real egotism can be awakened. Of course, Lord Rudra is always spiritually awake, but for our benefit he is praying in this way. For the impersonalist, pure egotism is aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi \u2014 \u201cI am not this body; I am spirit soul.\u201d But in its actual position, the spirit soul has devotional activities to perform. Therefore Lord \u015aiva prays to be engaged both in mind and in action in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord according to the direction of the Vedas. This is the process for purifying false egotism. Ceta\u1e25 means \u201cknowledge.\u201d Without perfect knowledge, one cannot act perfectly. The real source of knowledge is the v\u0101ca\u1e25, or sound vibration, given by Vedic instructions. Here the word v\u0101ca\u1e25, or vibration, means the Vedic vibration. The origin of creation is sound vibration, and if the sound vibration is clear and purified, perfect knowledge and perfect activities actually become manifest. This is enacted by the chanting of the mah\u0101-mantra: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Thus Lord \u015aiva is praying again and again for the purification of body, mind and activities through the purification of knowledge and action under the pure directions of the Vedas. Lord \u015aiva prays to the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that his mind, senses and words will all turn toward devotional activities only."

Please be merciful upon me and show me that form, for only that form worshiped by the devotees can perfectly satisfy all the demands of the senses.",
        "purport": " In the \u015bruti, or veda-mantra, it is said that the Supreme Absolute Truth is sarva-k\u0101ma\u1e25 sarva-gandha\u1e25 sarva-rasa\u1e25, or, in other words, He is known as raso vai sa\u1e25, the source of all relishable relationships (rasas). We have various senses \u2014 the powers of seeing, tasting, smelling, touching, etc. \u2014 and all the propensities of our senses can be satisfied when the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate: \u201cBhakti means engaging all the senses in the service of the master of the senses, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba.\u201d (N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra) These material senses, however, cannot be engaged in the service of the Lord; therefore one has to become free from all designations. Sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41 tatparatvena nirmalam: one has to become free from all designation or false egotism and thus become purified. When we engage our senses in the service of the Lord, the desires or the inclinations of the senses can be perfectly fulfilled. Lord \u015aiva therefore wants to see the Lord in a form which is inconceivable to the Bauddha philosophers, or the Buddhists. The impersonalists and the voidists also have to see the form of the Absolute. In Buddhist temples there are forms of Lord Buddha in meditation, but these are not worshiped like the forms of the Lord in Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava temples \u2014 forms like R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, S\u012bt\u0101-R\u0101ma or Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Amongst the different samprad\u0101yas (Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sects) either R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is worshiped. Lord \u015aiva wants to see that form perfectly, just as the devotees want to see it. The words r\u016bpa\u1e41 priyatama\u1e41 sv\u0101n\u0101m are specifically mentioned here, indicating that Lord \u015aiva wants to see that form which is very dear to the devotees. The word sv\u0101n\u0101m is especially significant because only the devotees are very, very dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, yog\u012bs and karm\u012bs are not particularly dear, for the karm\u012bs simply want to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their order supplier, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs want to see Him to become one with Him, and the yog\u012bs want to see Him partially represented within their heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101. But the bhaktas, or the devotees, want to see Him in His complete perfection. As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.30): \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept at playing on His flute, whose eyes are blooming like lotus petals, whose head is bedecked with peacock feathers, whose beauty is tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and whose unique loveliness charms millions of Cupids.\u201d Thus Lord \u015aiva\u2019s desire is to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is described in this way \u2014 that is, he wants to see Him as He appears to the bh\u0101gavatas, the devotees. The conclusion is that Lord \u015aiva wants to see Him in complete perfection and not in the impersonalist or voidist way. Although the Lord is one in His various forms (advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim), still His form as the young enjoyer of the gop\u012bs and companion of the cowherd boys (ki\u015bora-m\u016brti) is the most perfect form. Thus Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas accept the form of the Lord in His V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana pastimes as the chief form."

        "translation": "The Lord\u2019s beauty resembles a dark cloud during the rainy season. As the rainfall glistens, His bodily features also glisten. Indeed, He is the sum total of all beauty. The Lord has four arms and an exquisitely beautiful face with eyes like lotus petals, a beautiful highly raised nose, a mind-attracting smile, a beautiful forehead and equally beautiful and fully decorated ears.",
        "purport": " After the scorching heat of the summer season, it is very pleasing to see dark clouds in the sky. As confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, barh\u0101vata\u1e41sam asit\u0101mbuda-sundar\u0101\u1e45gam: the Lord wears a peacock feather in His hair, and His bodily complexion is just like a blackish cloud. The word sundara, or snigdha, means \u201cvery pleasing.\u201d Kandarpa-ko\u1e6di-kaman\u012bya: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s beauty is so pleasing that not even millions upon millions of Cupids can compare to it. The Lord\u2019s form as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is decorated in all opulence; therefore Lord \u015aiva is trying to see that most opulent form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Generally the worship of the Lord begins with the worship of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, whereas the worship of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and R\u0101dh\u0101 is most confidential. Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is worshipable by the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi, or regulative principles, whereas Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshipable by the bh\u0101gavata-vidhi. No one can worship the Lord in the bh\u0101gavata-vidhi without going through the regulations of the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi. Actually, neophyte devotees worship the Lord according to the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi, or the regulative principles enjoined in the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra. R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be approached by the neophyte devotees; therefore temple worship according to regulative principles is offered to Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Although there may be a R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a vigraha, or form, the worship of the neophyte devotees is acceptable as Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a worship. Worship according to the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi is called vidhi-m\u0101rga, and worship according to the bh\u0101gavata-vidhi principles is called r\u0101ga-m\u0101rga. The principles of r\u0101ga-m\u0101rga are especially meant for devotees who are elevated to the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana platform. The inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana \u2014 the gop\u012bs, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the cowherd boys, the cows and everyone else \u2014 are actually on the r\u0101ga-m\u0101rga or bh\u0101gavata-m\u0101rga platform. They participate in five basic rasas \u2014 d\u0101sya, sakhya, v\u0101tsalya, m\u0101dhurya and \u015b\u0101nta. But although these five rasas are found in the bh\u0101gavata-m\u0101rga, the bh\u0101gavata-m\u0101rga is especially meant for v\u0101tsalya and m\u0101dhurya, or parental and conjugal relationships. Yet there is the vipralambha-sakhya, the higher fraternal worship of the Lord especially enjoyed by the cowherd boys. Although there is friendship between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the cowherd boys, this friendship is different from the ai\u015bvarya friendship between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna. When Arjuna saw the vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, the gigantic universal form of the Lord, he was afraid for having treated K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary friend; therefore he begged K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pardon. However, the cowherd boys who are friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana sometimes ride on the shoulders of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They treat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a equally, just as they treat one another, and they are never afraid of Him, nor do they ever beg His pardon. Thus in the r\u0101ga-m\u0101rga, or bh\u0101gavata-m\u0101rga, friendship exists on a higher platform with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, namely the platform of vi\u015brambha friendship. Parental friendship, parental service and conjugal service are visible in the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana r\u0101ga-m\u0101rga relationships. Without serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a according to the vidhi-m\u0101rga regulative principles of the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi, unscrupulous persons want to jump immediately to the r\u0101ga-m\u0101rga principles. Such persons are called sahajiy\u0101. There are also demons who enjoy depicting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His pastimes with the gop\u012bs, taking advantage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by their licentious character. These demons who print books and write lyrics on the r\u0101ga-m\u0101rga principles are surely on the way to hell. Unfortunately, they lead others down with them. Devotees in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be very careful to avoid such demons. One should strictly follow the vidhi-m\u0101rga regulative principles in the worship of Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, although the Lord is present in the temple as R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a includes Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; therefore when one worships the Lord according to the regulative principles, the Lord accepts the service in the role of Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. In The Nectar of Devotion full instructions are given about the vidhi-m\u0101rga worship of R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Although there are sixty-four kinds of offenses one can commit in vidhi-m\u0101rga worship, in r\u0101ga-m\u0101rga worship there is no consideration of such offenses because the devotees on that platform are very much elevated, and there is no question of offense. But if we do not follow the regulative principles on the vidhi-m\u0101rga platform and keep our eyes trained to spot offenses, we will not make progress. In his description of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s beauty, Lord \u015aiva uses the words c\u0101rv\u0101yata-catur-b\u0101hu suj\u0101ta-rucir\u0101nanam, indicating the beautiful four-armed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Those who worship Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a describe Him as suj\u0101ta-rucir\u0101nanam. In the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva there are hundreds and thousands and millions of forms of the Supreme Lord, but of all these forms, the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most beautiful. Thus for those who worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the word suj\u0101ta-rucir\u0101nanam is used. The four arms of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u have different purposes. The hands holding a lotus flower and conchshell are meant for the devotees, whereas the other two hands, holding a disc and mace, or club, are meant for the demons. Actually all of the Lord\u2019s arms are auspicious, whether they are holding conchshells and flowers or clubs and discs. The demons killed by Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s cakra disc and club are elevated to the spiritual world, just like the devotees who are protected by the hands holding the lotus flower and conchshell. However, the demons who are elevated to the spiritual world are situated in the impersonal Brahman effulgence, whereas the devotees are allowed to enter into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Those who are devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are immediately elevated to the Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana planet. The Lord\u2019s beauty is compared to rainfall because when the rain falls in the rainy season, it becomes more and more pleasing to the people. After the scorching heat of the summer season, the people enjoy the rainy season very much. Indeed, they even come out of their doors in the villages and enjoy the rainfall directly. Thus the Lord\u2019s bodily features are compared to the clouds of the rainy season. The devotees enjoy the Lord\u2019s beauty because it is a collection of all kinds of beauties. Therefore the word sarva-saundarya-sa\u1e45graham is used. No one can say that the body of the Lord is wanting in beautiful parts. It is completely p\u016br\u1e47am. Everything is complete \u2014 God\u2019s creation, God\u2019s beauty and God\u2019s bodily features. All these are so complete that all one\u2019s desires can become fully satisfied when one sees the beauty of the Lord. The word sarva-saundarya indicates that there are different types of beauties in the material and spiritual worlds and that the Lord contains all of them. Both materialists and spiritualists can enjoy the beauty of the Lord. Because the Supreme Lord attracts everyone, including demons and devotees, materialists and spiritualists, He is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, His devotees also attract everyone. As mentioned in the \u1e62a\u1e0d-gosv\u0101m\u012b-stotra, dh\u012br\u0101dh\u012bra-jana-priyau: the Gosv\u0101m\u012bs are equally dear to the dh\u012bra (devotees) and adh\u012bra (demons). Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not very pleasing to the demons when He was present in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, but the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs were pleasing to the demons when they were present in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. That is the beauty of the Lord\u2019s dealings with His devotees; sometimes the Lord gives more credit to His devotees than He takes for Himself. For instance, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fought simply by giving directions. Yet it was Arjuna who took the credit for fighting. Nimitta-m\u0101tra\u1e41 bhava savyas\u0101cin: \u201cYou, O Savyas\u0101c\u012b [Arjuna], can be but an instrument in the fight.\u201d (Bg. 11.33) Everything was arranged by the Lord, but the credit of victory was given to Arjuna. Similarly, in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, everything is happening according to the predictions of Lord Caitanya, but the credit goes to Lord Caitanya\u2019s sincere servants. Thus the Lord is described herein as sarva-saundarya-sa\u1e45graham."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, Your two lotus feet are so beautiful that they appear like two blossoming petals of the lotus flower which grows during the autumn season. Indeed, the nails of Your lotus feet emanate such a great effulgence that they immediately dissipate all the darkness in the heart of a conditioned soul. My dear Lord, kindly show me that form of Yours which always dissipates all kinds of darkness in the heart of a devotee. My dear Lord, You are the supreme spiritual master of everyone; therefore all conditioned souls covered with the darkness of ignorance can be enlightened by You as the spiritual master.",
        "purport": " Lord \u015aiva has thus described the bodily features of the Lord authoritatively. Now he wants to see the lotus feet of the Lord. When a devotee wants to see the transcendental form of the Lord, he begins his meditation on the Lord\u2019s body by first looking at the feet of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is considered to be the transcendental sound form of the Lord, and the twelve cantos are divided in accordance with the transcendental form of the Lord. The First and Second cantos of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam are called the two lotus feet of the Lord. It is therefore suggested by Lord \u015aiva that one should first try to see the lotus feet of the Lord. This also means that if one is serious about reading \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, he must begin by seriously studying the First and Second cantos. The beauty of the lotus feet of the Lord is compared to the petals of a lotus flower which grows in the autumn season. By nature\u2019s law, in autumn the dirty or muddy waters of rivers and lakes become very clean. At that time the lotus flowers growing in the lakes appear very bright and beautiful. The lotus flower itself is compared to the lotus feet of the Lord, and the petals are compared to the nails of the feet of the Lord. The nails of the feet of the Lord are very bright, as Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 testifies. \u0100nanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya: every limb of the transcendental body of the Lord is made of \u0101nanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala. Thus every limb is eternally bright. As sunshine dissipates the darkness of this material world, the effulgence emanating from the body of the Lord immediately dries up the darkness in the heart of the conditioned soul. In other words, everyone serious about understanding the transcendental science and seeing the transcendental form of the Lord must first of all attempt to see the lotus feet of the Lord by studying the First and Second cantos of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. When one sees the lotus feet of the Lord, all kinds of doubts and fears within the heart are vanquished. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that in order to make spiritual progress, one must become fearless. Abhaya\u1e41 sattva-sa\u1e41\u015buddhi\u1e25 (Bg. 16.1). Fearfulness is the result of material involvement. It is also said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.2.37), bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101t: fearfulness is a creation of the bodily conception of life. As long as one is absorbed in the thought that he is this material body, he is fearful, and as soon as one is freed from this material conception, he becomes brahma-bh\u016bta, or self-realized, and immediately becomes fearless. Brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101 (Bg. 18.54). Without being fearless, one cannot be joyful. The bhaktas, the devotees, are fearless and always joyful because they are constantly engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. It is also said: By practicing bhagavad-bhakti-yoga, one becomes fearless and joyful. Unless one becomes fearless and joyful, he cannot understand the science of God. Bhagavat-tattva-vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 mukta-sa\u1e45gasya j\u0101yate. This verse refers to those who are completely liberated from the fearfulness of this material world. When one is so liberated, he can really understand the transcendental features of the form of the Lord. Lord \u015aiva therefore advises everyone to practice bhagavad-bhakti-yoga. As will be clear in the following verses, by doing so one can become really liberated and enjoy spiritual bliss. It is also stated: The Lord is the supreme spiritual master, and the bona fide representative of the Supreme Lord is also a spiritual master. The Lord from within enlightens the devotees by the effulgence of the nails of His lotus feet, and His representative, the spiritual master, enlightens from without. Only by thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord and always taking the spiritual master\u2019s advice can one advance in spiritual life and understand Vedic knowledge: Thus the Vedas (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23) enjoin that for one who has unflinching faith in the lotus feet of the Lord, as well as in the spiritual master, the real import of Vedic knowledge can be revealed."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, those who desire to purify their existence must always engage in meditation upon Your lotus feet, as described above. Those who are serious about executing their occupational duties and who want freedom from fear must take to this process of bhakti-yoga.",
        "purport": " It is said that the transcendental name, form, pastimes and entourage of the Lord cannot be appreciated by the blunt material senses; therefore one has to engage himself in devotional service so that the senses may be purified and one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here, however, it is indicated that those who are constantly engaged in meditating on the lotus feet of the Lord are certainly purified of the material contamination of the senses and are thus able to see the Supreme Lord face to face. The word \u201cmeditation\u201d is very popular in this age amongst the common people, but they do not know the actual meaning of meditation. However, from Vedic literature we learn that the yog\u012bs are always absorbed in meditation upon the lotus feet of the Lord: dhy\u0101n\u0101vasthita-tad-gatena manas\u0101 pa\u015byanti ya\u1e41 yogina\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 12.13.1). This is the real business of the yog\u012bs \u2014 to think of the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord \u015aiva therefore advises that one who is actually serious about purification must engage himself in this type of meditation or in the mystic yoga system, which will help him not only to see the Lord within constantly but to see Him face to face and become His associate in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka or Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. The word sva-dharmam (as in sva-dharmam anuti\u1e63\u1e6dhat\u0101m) indicates that the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama \u2014 which indicates the occupational duties of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra and which is the perfect institution for humanity \u2014 must be supported by bhakti-yoga if one at all wants security in life. Generally people think that simply by executing the occupational duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra or the duty of a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha or sanny\u0101s\u012b one becomes fearless or securely attains liberation, but factually unless all these occupational duties are accompanied by bhakti-yoga, one cannot become fearless. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 there are descriptions of karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, bhakti-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga, etc., but unless one comes to the point of bhakti-yoga, these other yogas cannot help one attain the highest perfection of life. In other words, bhakti-yoga is the only means for liberation. We find this conclusion also in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta in a discussion between Lord Caitanya and R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya regarding a human being\u2019s liberation from this material world. In that discussion R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya referred to the execution of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, and Lord Caitanya indicated that the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma was simply external (eho b\u0101hya). Lord Caitanya wanted to impress upon R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya that simply by executing the duties of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma one is not guaranteed liberation. Finally R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya referred to the process of bhakti-yoga: sth\u0101ne sthit\u0101\u1e25 \u015bruti-gat\u0101\u1e41 tanu-v\u0101\u1e45-manobhi\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.3). Regardless of one\u2019s condition of life, if he practices bhakti-yoga, which begins with hearing (\u015bruti-gat\u0101m) the transcendental messages of the Lord through the mouths of devotees, he gradually conquers the unconquerable God. God is known to be unconquerable, but one who submissively hears the words of a self-realized soul conquers the unconquerable. The conclusion is that if one is serious about liberation, he not only should execute the occupational duties of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma but should also engage in bhakti-yoga by beginning hearing from a realized soul. This process will help the devotee conquer the unconquerable Supreme Personality of Godhead and become His associate after giving up the material body."

This indicates that it is very difficult for one to attain the ultimate goal of life and reach the supreme destination, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka or Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, simply by studying Ved\u0101nta philosophy or Vedic literature. However, this highest perfectional stage can be attained by the devotees very easily. That is the meaning of vede\u1e63u durlabham adurlabham \u0101tma-bhaktau. The same point is confirmed by Lord \u015aiva in this verse. The Lord is very difficult for the karma-yog\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012bs and dhy\u0101na-yog\u012bs to attain. Those who are bhakti-yog\u012bs, however, have no difficulty at all.

Those who identify themselves as aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi (\u201cI am the Supreme Brahman, one with the Absolute Truth\u201d) also ultimately desire to attain perfect liberation in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55) it is said: \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d Thus if one desires to enter into the spiritual world, he must try to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by practicing bhakti-yoga. Simply by practicing bhakti-yoga one can understand the Supreme Lord in truth, but without such understanding, one cannot enter the spiritual kingdom. One may be elevated to the heavenly planets or may realize himself as Brahman (aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi), but that is not the end of realization. One must realize the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by bhakti-yoga; then real perfection of life is attained."

The word dur\u0101r\u0101dhya is especially significant. It is very difficult to attain the lotus feet of the Lord by any method other than bhakti-yoga."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.34) it is said that the Lord in the shape and form of death destroys all a person\u2019s possessions. M\u1e5btyu\u1e25 sarva-hara\u015b c\u0101ham: \u201cI am all-devouring death.\u201d The Lord in the shape of death takes away everything that is created by the conditioned soul. Everything in this material world is subject to perish in due course of time. However, all the strength of time cannot hamper the activities of a devotee, for a devotee takes complete shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord. For this reason only is a devotee free from formidable time. All the activities of the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, which have no touch of devotional service, are spoiled in due course of time. The material success of the karm\u012bs is destined to be destroyed; similarly, the impersonal realization attained by the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs is also destroyed in the course of time: To say nothing of the karm\u012bs, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs undergo severe austerities to attain the impersonal brahmajyoti, but because they do not find the lotus feet of the Lord, they fall down again into this material existence. Unless one is fully situated in unalloyed devotional service, there is no guarantee of liberation, even if one is elevated to the heavenly planets or to the impersonal Brahman effulgence. A devotee\u2019s achievement, however, is never lost by the influence of time. Even if a devotee cannot completely execute devotional service, in his next life he begins from the point where he left off. Such an opportunity is not given to the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, whose achievements are destroyed. The bhakta\u2019s achievement is never destroyed, for it goes on perpetually, be it complete or incomplete. This is the verdict of all Vedic literatures. \u015auc\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 \u015br\u012bmat\u0101\u1e41 gehe yoga-bhra\u1e63\u1e6do \u2019bhij\u0101yate: if one is unable to complete the process of bhakti-yoga, he is given a chance in his next life to take birth in a pure family of devotees or in a rich family. In such families a person can have a good opportunity to further progress in devotional service. When Yamar\u0101ja, the superintendent of death, was instructing his assistants, he told them not to approach the devotees. \u201cThe devotees should be offered respect,\u201d he said, \u201cbut do not go near them.\u201d Thus the devotees of the Lord are not under the jurisdiction of Yamar\u0101ja. Yamar\u0101ja is a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he controls the death of every living entity. Yet he has nothing to do with the devotees. Simply by blinking his eyes, time personified can destroy the entire cosmic manifestation, but he has nothing to do with the devotee. In other words, devotional service which is rendered by the devotee in this lifetime can never be destroyed by time. Such spiritual assets remain unchanged, being beyond the influence of time."

The word kaivalya means to merge into the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the word trida\u015ba-p\u016br refers to the heavenly planets where the demigods live. Thus for a devotee, kaivalya-sukha, or merging into the existence of the Lord, is hellish because the bhakta considers it suicidal to lose his individuality and merge into the effulgence of Brahman. A bhakta always wants to retain his individuality in order to render service to the Lord. Indeed, he considers promotion to the upper planetary systems to be no better than a will-o\u2019-the-wisp. Temporary, material happiness holds no value for a devotee. The devotee is in such an exalted position that he is not interested in the actions of karma or j\u00f1\u0101na. The resultant actions of karma and j\u00f1\u0101na are so insignificant to a devotee situated on the transcendental platform that he is not in the least interested in them. Bhakti-yoga is sufficient to give the bhakta all happiness. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.6), yay\u0101tm\u0101 supras\u012bdati. One can be fully satisfied simply by devotional service, and that is the result of association with a devotee. Without being blessed by a pure devotee, no one can be fully satisfied, nor can anyone understand the transcendental position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.25.25): Simply by the association of pure devotees one can understand the transcendental name, fame, quality and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has repeatedly said: Simply by associating with a pure devotee, one becomes wonderfully advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. S\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45ga, or association with a devotee, means always engaging in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and by acting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Specifically, chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra purifies one, and this chanting is therefore recommended by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam: by chanting the names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the mirror of the heart is cleansed, and the devotee loses interest in everything external. When one is influenced by the external energy of the Lord, his heart is impure. When one\u2019s heart is not pure, he cannot see how things are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ida\u1e41 hi vi\u015bva\u1e41 bhagav\u0101n ivetara\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.20). He whose heart is purified can see that the whole cosmic manifestation is but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he whose heart is contaminated sees things differently. Therefore by sat-sa\u1e45ga, or association with devotees, one becomes perfectly pure in heart. One who is pure in heart is never attracted by the external energy, which urges the individual soul to try to dominate material nature. The pure heart of a devotee is never disturbed when he executes devotional service in the form of hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. In all, there are nine processes one can follow in the execution of devotional service. In any case, a purehearted devotee is never disturbed. The bhakti-yoga process must be carried out by avoiding the ten offenses one can commit while chanting the mah\u0101-mantra and the sixty-four offenses one can commit while worshiping the Deity. When a devotee strictly follows the rules and regulations, Bhaktidev\u012b becomes very much satisfied with him, and at that time he is never disturbed by anything external. A devotee is also called a muni. The word muni means \u201cthoughtful.\u201d A devotee is as thoughtful as a nondevotee is speculative. The nondevotee\u2019s speculation is impure, but a devotee\u2019s thoughts are pure. Lord Kapila and \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b are also called muni, and Vy\u0101sadeva is addressed as Mah\u0101muni. A devotee is addressed as muni, or thoughtful, when he purely understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conclusion is that when one\u2019s heart is purified by the association of devotees and by the avoidance of the offenses committed when chanting and worshiping the Lord, the transcendental name, form and activities of the Lord are revealed by the Lord."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, the impersonal Brahman spreads everywhere, like the sunshine or the sky. And that impersonal Brahman, which spreads throughout the universe and in which the entire universe is manifested, is You.",
        "purport": " In Vedic literature it is said that everything is Brahman and nothing else. The whole cosmic manifestation rests on the Brahman effulgence. The impersonalists, however, cannot understand how such a huge cosmic manifestation can rest on a person. Thus this inconceivable power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not understood by the impersonalists; therefore they are puzzled and always denying that the Absolute Truth is a person. This wrong impression is cleared by Lord \u015aiva himself, who says that the impersonal Brahman, which is spread all over the universe, is nothing but the Supreme Lord Himself. Here it is clearly said that the Lord is spread everywhere, just like the sunshine, by virtue of His Brahman feature. This example is very easy to understand. All the planetary systems are resting upon the sunshine, yet the sunshine and the source of sunshine are aloof from the planetary manifestations. Similarly, the sky or air is spread everywhere; air is within a pot, but it also touches filthy places and sanctified places alike. In any case, the sky is uncontaminated. The sunshine also touches filthy places and sanctified places, and both are actually produced by the sun, but in any case the sun is aloof from all filthy things. Similarly, the Lord exists everywhere. There are pious things and impious things, but in the \u015b\u0101stras the pious things are described as the front of the Supreme Lord, whereas impious things are described as the back of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.4) the Lord clearly says: \u201cBy Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.\u201d This verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 explains that the Lord is spread everywhere by virtue of His Brahman feature. Everything rests in Him, yet He is not there. The conclusion is that without bhakti-yoga, without rendering devotional service to the Lord, even an impersonalist cannot understand the brahma-tattva, the Brahman feature. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra it is stated, ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101. This means that Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 or Parabrahman should be understood. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also the Absolute Truth is described as the one without a second, but He is realized in three features \u2014 impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate issue, and in this verse Lord \u015aiva confirms that ultimately the Absolute Truth is a person. He clearly says, tat tva\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 jyotir \u0101k\u0101\u015bam iva vist\u1e5btam. Here is a common example: a successful businessman may have many factories and offices, and everything rests on his order. If someone says that the entire business rests on such and such a person, it does not mean that the person is bearing all the factories and offices on his head. Rather, it is understood that by his brain or his energetic expansion, the business is running without interruption. Similarly, it is the brain and energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that carry on the complete manifestation of the material and spiritual worlds. The philosophy of monism, explained here very clearly, adjusts itself to the fact that the supreme source of all energy is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is described very clearly. It is also stated how the impersonal feature of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be understood: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b [Arjuna], I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and moon, the syllable o\u1e41 in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability in man.\u201d (Bg. 7.8) In this way K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be understood as the mystic power in everything."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, You have manifold energies, and these energies are manifested in manifold forms. With such energies You have also created this cosmic manifestation, and although You maintain it as if it were permanent, You ultimately annihilate it. Although You are never disturbed by such changes and alterations, the living entities are disturbed by them, and therefore they find the cosmic manifestation to be different or separated from You. My Lord, You are always independent, and I can clearly see this fact.",
        "purport": " It is clearly explained that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has multienergies, which can be grouped into three, namely the external energy, the internal energy and the marginal energy. There are also different cosmic manifestations \u2014 namely the spiritual world and the material world \u2014 as well as different types of living entities. Some living entities are conditioned, and others are eternally free. The eternally free living entities are called nitya-mukta, for they never come in contact with the material energy. However, some living entities are conditioned in this material world, and thus they think themselves separated from the Supreme Lord. Due to their contact with the material energy, their existence is always troublesome. Being always in distress, the conditioned soul considers the material energy to be very much disturbing. This fact is explained by a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava kavi, or poet: When the living entity forgets the Supreme Lord and wants to enjoy himself independently, imitating the Supreme Lord, he is captured by the false notion that he is the enjoyer and is separated from the Supreme Lord. This material energy is therefore very much troublesome to the spiritual energy, the living entity, but the material energy is never troublesome to the Supreme Lord. Indeed, for the Supreme Lord, both material and spiritual energy are the same. In this verse Lord \u015aiva explains that the material energy is never troublesome to the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is always independent, but because the living entities are not independent \u2014 due to their false idea of becoming independently happy \u2014 the material energy is troublesome. Consequently the material energy creates differentiation. Because the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers cannot understand this, they want to be relieved from the material energy. However, because a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosopher is in full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he finds no disturbance even in the material energy. This is because he knows how to utilize the material energy for the service of the Lord. In the government, the criminal department and civil department may appear different in the eyes of the citizens, but in the eyes of the government both departments are one and the same. The criminal department is troublesome for the criminal but not for the obedient citizen. Similarly, this material energy is troublesome for the conditioned soul, but it has nothing to do with the liberated souls who are engaged in the service of the Lord. Through the puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ra Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead created the whole cosmic manifestation. Simply by breathing out all the universes, the Lord creates and maintains the cosmic manifestation as Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Then as Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, He annihilates the cosmic manifestation. Yet despite the creation, maintenance and destruction of the cosmos, the Lord is not affected. The various activities of the Lord must be very disturbing to the tiny living entities, but since the Lord is supremely great, He is never affected. Lord \u015aiva or any other pure devotee can see this clearly without being blinded by bheda-buddhi, or differentiation. For a devotee, the Lord is the supreme spirit soul. Since He is supremely powerful, His various powers are also spiritual. For a devotee, there is nothing material, for material existence only means forgetfulness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Yog\u012bs other than the devotees \u2014 namely the karma-yog\u012b and j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b \u2014 worship You by their respective actions in their respective positions. It is stated both in the Vedas and in the \u015b\u0101stras that are corollaries of the Vedas, and indeed everywhere, that it is only You who are to be worshiped. That is the expert version of all the Vedas.",
        "purport": " In a previous verse Lord \u015aiva wanted to see the form of the Lord which the devotees are always interested in. There are other forms of the Lord manifest in the material world, including Brahm\u0101 and other demigods, and these are worshiped by materialistic persons. In the Second Canto, Third Chapter, of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, it is stated that those who desire material benefits are recommended to worship different types of demigods, and in conclusion the Bh\u0101gavatam recommends: The devotees, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, who are known as mok\u1e63a-k\u0101ma, and the karm\u012bs, who are known as sarva-k\u0101ma, are all aspiring to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Even when one performs yaj\u00f1as, as stated here (kriy\u0101-kal\u0101pai\u1e25), he should always remember that the demigods are but agents of the Supreme Lord. Actually the worshipful Lord is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Yaj\u00f1e\u015bvara. Thus even when different demigods are worshiped in the Vedic and Tantric sacrifices, the actual goal of sacrifice is Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.23) it is said: \u201cWhatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunt\u012b, is really meant for Me alone, but is offered without true understanding.\u201d Thus the worshipers of various demigods also worship the Supreme Lord, but they do so against the regulative principles. The purpose of the regulative principles is to satisfy Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (3.8.9) the very same thing is confirmed: Here it is clearly mentioned that the karm\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b or yog\u012b \u2014 in fact, everyone \u2014 worships Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u if he is actually expert in knowledge of the Vedas and Tantras. The word kovid\u0101\u1e25 is very significant, for it indicates the devotees of the Lord. Only the devotees know perfectly that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is all-pervading. Within the material energy, He is represented by the five material elements as well as the mind, intelligence and ego. He is also represented by another energy \u2014 the living entities \u2014 and all these manifestations in the spiritual and material world combined are but representations of the different energies of the Lord. The conclusion is that the Lord is one and that He is expanded in everything. This is understood by the Vedic version: sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma. One who knows this concentrates all his energy in worshiping Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, You are the only Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. Before the creation of this material world, Your material energy remains in a dormant condition. When Your material energy is agitated, the three qualities \u2014 namely goodness, passion and ignorance \u2014 act, and as a result the total material energy \u2014 egotism, ether, air, fire, water, earth and all the various demigods and saintly persons \u2014 becomes manifest. Thus the material world is created.",
        "purport": " If the whole creation is one \u2014 that is, nothing but the Supreme Lord, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2014 then why do the expert transcendentalists make such categories as are found in the above verse? Why do learned and expert scholars distinguish between matter and spirit? In answer to these questions, Lord \u015aiva says that spirit and matter are not creations of various philosophers, but are manifested by Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, as described in this verse: tvam eka \u0101dya\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e25. Spiritual and material categories are made possible by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but actually there are no such distinctions for the living entities who are eternally engaged in the service of the Lord. There is only a material world for those who want to imitate the Lord and become enjoyers. Indeed, the material world is nothing but forgetfulness of the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the creator of everything. The distinction between matter and spirit is created by the sleeping energy of the Lord when the Lord wants to give some facility to those living entities who want to imitate the Lord in His enjoyment. It is only for them that this material world is created by the dormant energy of the Lord. For instance, sometimes children want to imitate their mother and cook in the kitchen, and at such a time the mother supplies them with some toys so that the children can imitate her cooking. Similarly, when some of the living entities want to imitate the activities of the Lord, this material cosmic manifestation is created for them by the Lord. The material creation is therefore caused by the Lord through His material energy. It is by the glance of the Lord that the material energy is activated. At that time the three material qualities are set into motion, and the material energy is manifested first in the form of the mahat-tattva, then egotism, then ether, then air, fire, water and earth. After the creation, the living entities are impregnated in the cosmic manifestation, and they emerge as Lord Brahm\u0101 and the seven great \u1e5b\u1e63is, then as different demigods. From the demigods come human beings, animals, trees, birds, beasts and everything else. The original cause, however, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as verified herein: tvam eka \u0101dya\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e25. This is also confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.1): Those who are covered by the material energy cannot understand that the origin of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is summarized in the Ved\u0101nta aphorism janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25 (Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra 1.1.2). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also confirms this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8): \u201cI am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.\u201d When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He is the origin of everything (aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25), He means that He is even the source of Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, the puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ras, the material manifestation and all the living entities within the material world. Actually the word prabhava, \u201ccreation,\u201d refers only to this material world, for since the spiritual world is eternally existing, there is no question of creation. In the catu\u1e25-\u015blok\u012b of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the Lord says, aham ev\u0101sam ev\u0101gre: \u201cI was existing in the beginning before the creation.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.9.33) In the Vedas it is also said, eko n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u0101s\u012bt: \u201cBefore the creation there was only N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\u201d This is also confirmed by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 paro\u00a0\u2019vyakt\u0101t: \u201cN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is transcendental to the creation.\u201d (G\u012bta-bh\u0101\u1e63ya) Since all the activities of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a are spiritual, when N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a said, \u201cLet there be creation,\u201d that creation was all-spiritual. The \u201cmaterial\u201d only exists for those who have forgotten that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is the original cause."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, after creating by Your own potencies, You enter within the creation in four kinds of forms. Being within the hearts of the living entities, You know them and know how they are enjoying their senses. The so-called happiness of this material creation is exactly like the bees\u2019 enjoyment of honey after it has been collected in the honeycomb.",
        "purport": " The material cosmic manifestation is an exhibition of the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because dull matter cannot work independently, the Lord Himself enters within this material creation in the form of a partial expansion (Param\u0101tm\u0101), and He enters also by His separated parts and parcels (the living entities). In other words, both the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead enter into the material creation just to make it active. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.5): \u201cBesides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with the material nature and are sustaining the universe.\u201d Since the material world cannot work independently, the living entities enter into the material manifestation in four different types of bodies. The word catur-vidham is significant in this verse. There are four types of living entities born within this material world: some are born by way of an embryo (jar\u0101yu-ja), some by way of eggs (a\u1e47\u1e0da-ja), some by perspiration (sveda-ja), and some, like the trees, by way of seeds (udbhij-ja). Regardless of how these living entities appear, they are all busy in the pursuit of sense enjoyment. The materialistic scientists\u2019 contention that living entities other than human beings have no soul is nullified herein. Whether they are born through an embryo, eggs, perspiration or seeds, all living entities in the 8,400,000 species of life are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and each therefore is an individual spiritual spark and soul. The Supreme Personality of Godhead also remains within the heart of the living entity, regardless of whether the living entity is a man, animal, tree, germ or microbe. The Lord resides in everyone\u2019s heart, and because all living entities who come to this material world do so in order to fulfill their desire for sense enjoyment, the Lord directs the living entities to enjoy their senses. Thus the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, knows everyone\u2019s desires. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): \u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\u201d Remaining within the hearts of all living entities, the Lord bestows remembrance by which the living entities can enjoy certain things. Thus the living entities create their enjoyable honeycombs and then enjoy them. The example of the bees is appropriate because when bees try to enjoy their honeycomb, they have to suffer the bites of other bees. Because bees bite one another when they enjoy honey, they are not exclusively enjoying the sweetness of the honey, for there is also suffering. In other words, the living entities are subjected to the pains and pleasures of material enjoyment, whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead, knowing their plans for sense enjoyment, is aloof from them. In the Upani\u1e63ads the example is given of two birds sitting on a tree. One bird (the j\u012bva, or living entity) is enjoying the fruits of that tree, and the other bird (Param\u0101tm\u0101) is simply witnessing. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.23) the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is described as upadra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 (the overseer) and anumant\u0101 (the permitter). Thus the Lord simply witnesses and gives the living entity sanction for sense enjoyment. It is the Param\u0101tm\u0101 also who gives the intelligence by which the bees can construct a hive, collect honey from various flowers, store it and enjoy it. Although the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is aloof from the living entities, He knows their intentions, and He gives them facilities by which they can enjoy or suffer the results of their actions. Human society is exactly like a beehive, for everyone is engaged in collecting honey from various flowers, or collecting money from various sources, and creating large empires for common enjoyment. However, after these empires are created, the bites of other nations have to be suffered. Sometimes nations declare war upon one another, and the human beehives become sources of misery. Although human beings are creating their beehives in order to enjoy the sweetness of their senses, they are at the same time suffering from the bites of other persons or nations. The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is simply witnessing all these activities. The conclusion is that both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the j\u012bvas enter into this material world. However, the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supreme Personality of Godhead, is worshipable because He has arranged for the happiness of the living entity in the material world. Because it is the material world, however, no one can enjoy any kind of happiness without inebriety. Material enjoyment means inebriety, whereas spiritual enjoyment means pure enjoyment under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Time scatters everything, exactly as the wind scatters clouds in the sky.",
        "purport": " The process of destruction is going on according to the law of nature. Nothing within this material world can be permanent, although scientists, philosophers, workers and everyone else are trying to make things permanent. One foolish scientist recently declared that eventually life will be made permanent through science. Some so-called scientists are also trying to manufacture living entities within the laboratory. Thus in one way or another everyone is busy denying the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and rejecting the supreme authority of the Lord. However, the Lord is so powerful that He destroys everything in the form of death. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.34), m\u1e5btyu\u1e25 sarva-hara\u015b c\u0101ham: \u201cI am all-devouring death.\u201d The Lord is just like death to the atheists, for He takes away everything they accumulate in the material world. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, the father of Prahl\u0101da, always denied the existence of the Lord, and he tried to kill his five-year-old boy due to the boy\u2019s unflinching faith in God. However, in due course of time the Lord appeared as N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva and killed Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu in the presence of his son. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.13.47), this killing process is natural. J\u012bvo j\u012bvasya j\u012bvanam: \u201cOne animal is food for another animal.\u201d A frog is eaten by a snake, a snake is eaten by a mongoose, and the mongoose is eaten by another animal. In this way the process of destruction goes on by the supreme will of the Lord. Although we do not see the hand of the Supreme Lord directly, we can feel the presence of that hand through the Lord\u2019s process of destruction. We can see the clouds scattered by the wind, although we cannot see how this is being done because it is not possible to see the wind. Similarly, although we do not directly see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we can see that He controls the process of destruction. The destructive process is going on fiercely under the control of the Lord, but the atheists cannot see it."

This is due to uncontrollable greed. The greed for material enjoyment is always existing in the living entity, but Your Lordship is always alert, and in due course of time You strike him, just as a snake seizes a mouse and very easily swallows him.",
        "purport": " Everyone is greedy, and everyone makes plans for material enjoyment. In his lust for material enjoyment, the living entity is described as a madman. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.27): \u201cThe bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities which are in actuality carried out by nature.\u201d Everything is enacted by the laws of nature, and these laws are under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The atheists, or unintelligent men, do not know this. They are busy making their own plans, and big nations are busy expanding their empires. And yet we know that in due course of time many empires have come into existence and been destroyed. Many aristocratic families were created by people in their extreme madness, but we can see that in the course of time those families and empires have all been destroyed. But still the foolish atheists do not accept the supreme authority of the Lord. Such foolish people unnecessarily concoct their own duties without referring to the supreme authority of the Lord. The so-called political leaders are busy making plans to advance the material prosperity of their nation, but factually these political leaders only want an exalted position for themselves. Due to their greed for material position, they falsely present themselves as leaders before the people and collect their votes, although they are completely under the grip of the laws of material nature. These are some of the faults of modern civilization. Without taking to God consciousness and accepting the authority of the Lord, the living entities become ultimately confused and frustrated in their planmaking attempts. Due to their unauthorized plans for economic development, the price of commodities is rising daily all over the world, so much so that is has become difficult for the poorer classes, and they are suffering the consequences. And due to lack of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, people are being fooled by so-called leaders and planmakers. Consequently, the sufferings of the people are increasing. According to the laws of nature, which are backed by the Lord, nothing can be permanent within this material world; therefore everyone should be allowed to take shelter of the Absolute in order to be saved. In this regard, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29): \u201cThe sage who knows Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.\u201d If one wants peace of mind and tranquillity in society, he must accept the fact that the real enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is the proprietor of everything all over the universe, and He is the supreme friend of all living entities as well. By understanding this, people can become happy and peaceful individually and collectively."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, any learned person knows that unless he worships You, his entire life is spoiled. Knowing this, how could he give up worshiping Your lotus feet? Even our father and spiritual master, Lord Brahm\u0101, unhesitatingly worshiped You, and the fourteen Manus followed in his footsteps.",
        "purport": " The word pa\u1e47\u1e0dita means \u201ca wise man.\u201d Who is actually a wise man? The wise man is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19) in this way: \u201cAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.\u201d Thus when the wise man actually becomes wise after many births and whimsical attempts at self-realization, he surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such a mah\u0101tm\u0101, or learned person, knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, is everything (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti). Learned persons always think that life is wasted unless they worship Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or become His devotee. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b also says that when one becomes an advanced devotee, he understands that he should be reserved and perseverant (k\u1e63\u0101nti\u1e25) and that he should engage in the service of the Lord and not waste time (avyartha-k\u0101latvam). He should also be detached from all material attraction (virakti\u1e25), and he should not long for any material respect in return for his activities (m\u0101na-\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101). He should be certain that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will bestow His mercy upon him (\u0101\u015b\u0101-bandha\u1e25), and he should always be very eager to serve the Lord faithfully (samutka\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101). The wise man is always very eager to glorify the Lord by chanting and hearing (n\u0101ma-g\u0101ne sad\u0101 ruci\u1e25), and he is always eager to describe the transcendental qualities of the Lord (\u0101saktis tad-gu\u1e47\u0101khy\u0101ne). He should also be attracted to those places where the Lord had His pastimes (pr\u012btis tad-vasati-sthale). These are symptoms of an advanced devotee. An advanced devotee, or a perfect human being who is actually wise and learned, cannot give up his service at the lotus feet of the Lord. Although Lord Brahm\u0101 has a long life span (4,320,000,000 years constitute twelve hours in a day of Brahm\u0101), Brahm\u0101 is afraid of death and consequently engages in the devotional service of the Lord. Similarly, all the Manus who appear and disappear during the day of Brahm\u0101 are also engaged in the Lord\u2019s devotional service. In Brahm\u0101\u2019s one day, fourteen Manus appear and disappear. The first Manu is Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu. Each Manu lives for seventy-one yugas, each consisting of some 4,320,000 years. Although the Manus have such a long life span, they still prepare for the next life by engaging in the devotional service of the Lord. In this age human beings only live for sixty or eighty years, and even this small life span is gradually decreasing. Therefore it is even more imperative for human beings to take to the worship of the lotus feet of the Lord by constantly chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, as recommended by Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: When one is engaged in devotional service, he is often surrounded by envious people, and often many enemies come to try to defeat him or stop him. This is not new in this present age, for even in the days of yore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who was engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, was harassed by his demoniac father, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. The atheists are always prepared to harass a devotee; therefore Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu suggested that one be very tolerant of these people. Nonetheless, one has to continue chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and preaching the chanting of this mantra because such preaching and chanting constitute the perfection of life. One should chant and preach about the urgency of making this life perfect in all respects. One should thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord and follow in the footsteps of previous \u0101c\u0101ryas, beginning with Lord Brahm\u0101 and others."

        "purport": " For the purpose of creation, maintenance and annihilation of this cosmic manifestation, there are three lords \u2014 Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u015aiva (Mahe\u015bvara). The material body is finished at the time of annihilation. Both the universal body and the small unit, the individual living entity\u2019s body, are susceptible to annihilation at the ultimate end. However, the devotees do not fear the annihilation of the body, for they are confident that after the annihilation they will go back home, back to Godhead (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so\u00a0\u2019rjuna). If one strictly follows the process of devotional service, he has no fear of death, for he is predestined to go back home, back to Godhead. The nondevotees are fearful of death because they have no guarantee of where they are going or of the type of body they are going to get in their next life. The word rudra-bhaya is significant in this verse because Rudra himself, Lord \u015aiva, is speaking of \u201cfear of Rudra.\u201d This indicates that there are many Rudras \u2014 eleven Rudras \u2014 and the Rudra (Lord \u015aiva) who was offering this prayer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is different from the other Rudras, although he is as powerful as they are. The conclusion is that one Rudra is afraid of another Rudra because each and every one of them is engaged in the destruction of this cosmic manifestation. But for the devotee, everyone is afraid of Rudra, even Rudra himself. A devotee is never afraid of Rudra because he is always secure, being protected by the lotus feet of the Lord.

        "purport": " The word asak\u1e5bt is significant, for it means not just for a few minutes but continuously. That is the instruction given by Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu in His \u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka. K\u012brtan\u012bya\u1e25 sad\u0101 hari\u1e25: \u201cThe holy name of the Lord should be chanted twenty-four hours daily.\u201d Therefore in this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement we request the devotees to chant at least sixteen rounds on their beads daily. Actually one has to chant twenty-four hours daily, just like \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa, who was chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra three hundred thousand times daily. Indeed, he had no other business. Some of the Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, like Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, were also chanting very rigidly and also offering obeisances very rigidly. As stated in \u015ar\u012bniv\u0101s\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s prayer to the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs (\u1e62a\u1e0d-gosv\u0101my-a\u1e63\u1e6daka), sa\u1e45khy\u0101-p\u016brvaka-n\u0101ma-g\u0101na-natibhi\u1e25 k\u0101l\u0101vas\u0101n\u012b-k\u1e5btau.

Because the princes were ready to enter into some severe austerity in order to worship the Lord, Lord \u015aiva advised them to constantly chant of and meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is significant that Lord \u015aiva personally offered his prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead just as he was taught by his father, Lord Brahm\u0101. Similarly, he was also preaching to the princes according to the parampar\u0101 system. One not only should practice the instructions received from the spiritual master but should also distribute this knowledge to one\u2019s disciples. The words \u0101tm\u0101nam \u0101tma-stha\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63v avasthitam are also significant. The Personality of Godhead is the origin of all living entities. Because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, He is the father of all of them. One can search out the Supreme Lord very easily within one\u2019s heart, for He is situated in every living entity\u2019s heart. In this verse the process of worshiping the Lord is considered to be very easy and complete, for anyone can sit down anywhere and in any condition of life and simply chant the holy names of the Lord. By chanting and hearing, one automatically engages in meditation."

        "translation": "My dear princes, in the form of a prayer I have delineated the yoga system of chanting the holy name. All of you should take this important stotra within your minds and promise to keep it in order to become great sages. By acting silently like a great sage and by giving attention and reverence, you should practice this method.",
        "purport": " In the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system one has to practice bodily exercises, dhy\u0101na, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, \u0101sana, meditation, etc. One also has to sit in one place in a particular posture and concentrate his gaze on the tip of the nose. There are so many rules and regulations for the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system that it is practically impossible to perform it in this age. The alternative system of bhakti-yoga is very easy not only in this age but in others as well, for this yoga system was advocated long ago by Lord \u015aiva when he advised the princes, the sons of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi\u1e63at. The bhakti-yoga system is not newly introduced, for even five thousand years ago Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommended this bhakti-yoga as the topmost yoga. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.47): \u201cOf all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\u201d The topmost yog\u012b is he who constantly thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within himself and chants the glories of the Lord. In other words, this system of bhakti-yoga has been existing from time immemorial and is now continuing in this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. The word muni-vrat\u0101\u1e25 is significant in this regard because those who are interested in advancing in spiritual life must be silent. Silence means talking only of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101. This is the silence of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a: \u201cKing Ambar\u012b\u1e63a always fixed his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord and talked of Him only.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 9.4.19) We should also take this opportunity in life to become as good as a great saint simply by not talking unnecessarily with unwanted persons. We should either talk of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a undeviatingly. This is called muni-vrata. The intelligence must be very sharp (sam\u0101hita-dhiya\u1e25) and should always be acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The words etad abhyasat\u0101d\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25 indicate that if one takes these instructions from a spiritual master with great reverence (\u0101d\u1e5bta) and practices them accordingly, he will find this bhakti-yoga process to be very, very easy."

        "translation": "This prayer was first spoken to us by Lord Brahm\u0101, the master of all creators. The creators, headed by Bh\u1e5bgu, were instructed in these prayers because they wanted to create.",
        "purport": " Lord Brahm\u0101 was created by Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; then Lord Brahm\u0101 created Lord \u015aiva and other great sages, headed by Bh\u1e5bgu Muni. These great sages included Bh\u1e5bgu, Mar\u012bci, \u0100treya, Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha and others. All these great sages were in charge of creating population. Since there were not very many living entities in the beginning, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u entrusted Brahm\u0101 with the business of creation, and Brahm\u0101 in his turn created many hundreds and thousands of demigods and great sages to continue with the creation. At the same time, Lord Brahm\u0101 cautioned all his sons and disciples by reciting the prayers now recited by Lord \u015aiva. The material creation means material engagement, but material engagements can be counteracted if we always remember our relationship with the Lord as that relationship is described in these prayers recited by Lord \u015aiva. In this way we can remain constantly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus despite our engagement in the creation, we cannot be deviated from the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is especially meant for this purpose. In this material world everyone is engaged in some particular occupational duty which is prescribed in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas, \u015b\u016bdras and everyone are engaged in their occupational duty, but if one remembers his first duty \u2014 keeping in constant contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 everything will be successful. If one simply executes the rules and regulations of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma in the role of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra and keeps busy and does not remember one\u2019s eternal relationship with the Lord, one\u2019s business and activities as well as occupational duties will simply be a waste of time. This is confirmed in the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.8): The conclusion is that even if one is busy executing his occupational duty, his business in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness need not be hampered. He has simply to execute the devotional service of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam \u2014 hearing, chanting and remembering. One need not abandon his occupational duty. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.46): \u201cBy worship of the Lord \u2014 who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading \u2014 man can, in the performance of his own duty, attain perfection.\u201d Thus one can continue with his occupational duty, but if he worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Lord \u015aiva herein prescribes, he attains his perfection of life. Svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhitasya dharmasya sa\u1e41siddhir hari-to\u1e63a\u1e47am (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.13): we should continue executing our occupational duties, but if we try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by our duties, then our lives will be perfected."

        "purport": " In this verse we can understand that the various types of living entities were created simultaneously at the very beginning of the creation. The nonsensical Darwinian theory of evolution is not applicable here. It is not that intelligent human beings did not exist millions of years ago. On the contrary, it is understood that the most intelligent creature, Lord Brahm\u0101, was first created. Then Lord Brahm\u0101 created other saintly sages like Mar\u012bci, Bh\u1e5bgu, \u0100treya, Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha and Lord \u015aiva. They in their turn created different types of bodies according to karma. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam Lord Kapiladeva told His mother that the living entity gets a particular type of body in accordance with his work and that this body is decided upon by higher authorities. The higher authorities, as appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are Lord Brahm\u0101 and all other Praj\u0101patis and Manus. Thus from the beginning of creation it can be seen that the first creature is the most intelligent. It is not that so-called modern intelligence has developed by the gradual process of evolution. As stated in Brahma-vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47a, there is a gradual evolutionary process, but it is not the body that is evolving. All the bodily forms are already there. It is the spiritual entity, or spiritual spark within the body, that is being promoted by the laws of nature under the supervision of superior authority. We can understand from this verse that from the very beginning of creation different varieties of living entities were existing. It is not that some of them have become extinct. Everything is there; it is due to our lack of knowledge that we cannot see things in their proper perspective. In this verse the word dhvasta-tamasa\u1e25 is very important, for without being free of ignorance one cannot control the creation of different types of living entities. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.31.1), daiva-netre\u1e47a: bodies are awarded under the supervision of superior powers. How can these superior powers control the evolutionary process of the living entity if they are not free from all imperfection? The followers of the Vedic instructions cannot accept the Darwinian theory of evolution, for it is marred by imperfect knowledge."

Any devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can attain all perfection, material gains and liberation simply by offering prayers to Him. There are many varieties of prayers to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a chanted by great sages and great personalities such as Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as \u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam (Bh\u0101g. 11.5.33). \u015aiva means Lord \u015aiva, and viri\u00f1ci means Lord Brahm\u0101. Both of these demigods are engaged in offering prayers to Lord V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

To save living entities from such a calamity, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a points out in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19): \u201cAfter many, many births and deaths, a wise man surrenders unto Me, knowing very well that I, V\u0101sudeva, am everything.

        "purport": " Actually everyone is suffering within this material world due to ignorance. Every day we see that a person without knowledge commits some criminal act and is later arrested and punished, despite the fact that he actually may not have been conscious of his sinful activity. Such ignorance prevails throughout the world. People do not consider how they are risking their lives in an attempt to have illicit sex life, kill animals to satisfy their tongue, enjoy intoxication and gamble. It is very regrettable that the leaders of the world do not know of the effects of these sinful activities. They are instead taking things very easily and are succeeding in making the ocean of nescience wider and wider. Opposed to such ignorance, full knowledge is the greatest achievement within this material world. We can practically see that one who has sufficient knowledge is saved from many dangerous pitfalls in life. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19), bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate: \u201cWhen one actually becomes wise, he surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d V\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25: \u201cSuch a great soul is very rarely to be found.\u201d This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is determined to open wide the eyes of the so-called leaders, who are full of ignorance, and thus save them from the many pitfalls and dangerous conditions of life. The greatest danger is the danger of getting a body lower than that of a human being. It was with great difficulty that we attained this human form of life just to take advantage of this body and reestablish our relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda. Lord \u015aiva advises, however, that those who take advantage of his prayers will very soon become devotees of Lord V\u0101sudeva and thus will be able to cross the ocean of nescience and make life perfect."

When we act under the direction of supreme authority, we do not become entangled by fruitive results. For instance, Arjuna fought because the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted him to; therefore he was not responsible for the outcome of the fighting. As far as devotional service is concerned, even hearing and chanting is as good as acting with our body, mind and senses. Actually, hearing and chanting are also activities of the senses.
