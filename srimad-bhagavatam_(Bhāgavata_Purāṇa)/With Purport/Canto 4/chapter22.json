During the reign of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, everything on the surface of this globe was sinless, and therefore the Kum\u0101ras decided to see the King. Ordinarily they do not go to any planet which is sinful."

The conditioned soul is attracted by the objects of sense gratification. His eyes are attracted to see beautiful things, his ears are attracted to hear nice music, his nose is attracted to enjoy the aroma of a nice flower, and his tongue is attracted to taste nice food. Similarly, all his other senses \u2014 his hands, his legs, his belly, his genitals, his mind, etc. \u2014 are so susceptible to the attraction of the objects of enjoyment that he cannot restrain himself. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, in the same way, could not restrain himself from receiving the four Kum\u0101ras, who were bright by dint of their spiritual progress, and thus not only he himself but also his officers and associates all received the four Kum\u0101ras. It is said, \u201cBirds of a feather flock together.\u201d In this world, everyone is attracted by a person of the same category. A drunkard is attracted to persons who are also drunkards. Similarly, a saintly person is attracted by other saintly persons. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was in the topmost position of spiritual advancement, and as such, he was attracted by the Kum\u0101ras, who were of the same category. It is said, therefore, that a man is known by his company."

In the beginning of the creation there was a great need of population; therefore Lord Brahm\u0101 was creating one son after another and ordering them to increase. However, when the Kum\u0101ras were requested to do so, they declined. They wanted to remain brahmac\u0101r\u012b throughout life and be engaged fully in the devotional service of the Lord. The Kum\u0101ras are called nai\u1e63\u1e6dhika-brahmac\u0101r\u012b, meaning they are never to marry. Because of their refusal to marry, Lord Brahm\u0101 became so angry that his eyes became reddish. From between his eyes, Lord \u015aiva, or Rudra, appeared. The mode of anger is consequently known as rudra. Lord \u015aiva also has a samprad\u0101ya party, known as the Rudra samprad\u0101ya, and they are also known as Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas."

Great demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, Indra and Candra are sometimes bewildered trying to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It so happened that when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present on this planet, Lord Brahm\u0101 and King Indra also mistook Him. And what to speak of great yog\u012bs or j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who conclude that the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is impersonal? In the same way, great personalities and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas like the four Kum\u0101ras are also invisible to ordinary persons, although they are traveling all over the universe in different planetary systems. When San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b went to see Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, he could not be recognized by Candra\u015bekhara \u0100c\u0101rya.

It is said, therefore, that one cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead or a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava with these material eyes. One has to purify his senses and engage in the service of the Lord.

        "purport": " Materially, if a man is not very rich he is not glorious; and spiritually, if a man is too attached to family life he is also not glorious. But saintly persons are quite ready to visit the house of a poor man or a man who is attached to material family life. When this happens, the owner of the house and his servants are glorified because they offer water for washing the feet of a saintly person, sitting places and other things to receive him. The conclusion is that if a saintly person goes to the house of even an unimportant man, such a person becomes glorious by his blessings. It is therefore the Vedic system that a householder invite a saintly person in his home to receive his blessings. This system is still current in India, and therefore saintly persons, wherever they go, are hosted by the householders, who in turn get an opportunity to receive transcendental knowledge. It is the duty of a sanny\u0101s\u012b, therefore, to travel everywhere just to favor the householders, who are generally ignorant of the values of spiritual life. It may be argued that all householders are not very rich and that one cannot receive great saintly persons or preachers because they are always accompanied by their disciples. If a householder is to receive a saintly person, he has to receive his entourage also. It is said in the \u015b\u0101stras that Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was always accompanied by sixty thousand disciples and that if there was a little discrepancy in their reception he would be very angry and would sometimes curse the host. The fact is that every householder, regardless of his position or economic condition, can at least receive saintly guests with great devotion and offer them drinking water, for drinking water is available always. In India the custom is that even an ordinary person is offered a glass of water if he suddenly visits and one cannot offer him foodstuff. If there is no water, then one can offer a sitting place, even if it is on straw mats. And if one has no straw mat, he can immediately cleanse the ground and ask the guest to sit there. Supposing that a householder cannot even do that, then with folded hands he can simply receive the guest, saying, \u201cWelcome.\u201d And if he cannot do that, then he should feel very sorry for his poor condition and shed tears and simply offer obeisances with his whole family, wife and children. In this way he can satisfy any guest, even if the guest is a saintly person or a king."

        "translation": "On the contrary, even though full of all opulence and material prosperity, any householder\u2019s house where the devotees of the Lord are never allowed to come in, and where there is no water for washing their feet, is to be considered a tree in which all venomous serpents live.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word t\u012brtha-p\u0101d\u012bya indicates devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. As far as br\u0101hma\u1e47as are concerned, in the previous verse the mode of reception has been already described. Now, in this verse, special stress is being given to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Generally the sanny\u0101s\u012bs, or those in the renounced order of life, take trouble to enlighten the householders. There are ekada\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs and trida\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs. The ekada\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs are generally followers of \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya and are known as M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, whereas the trida\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs are followers of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas \u2014 R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya and so on \u2014 and they take trouble to enlighten the householders. Ekada\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs can be situated on the platform of pure Brahman because they are aware that the spirit soul is different from the body, but they are mainly impersonalists. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas know that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person and that the Brahman effulgence is based on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.27): brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham. The conclusion is that t\u012brtha-p\u0101d\u012bya refers to Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. In the Bh\u0101gavatam (1.13.10) there is also another reference: t\u012brth\u012b-kurvanti t\u012brth\u0101ni. Wherever he goes, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava immediately makes that place a t\u012brtha, a place of pilgrimage. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs travel all over the world to make every place a place of pilgrimage by the touch of their lotus feet. It is mentioned here that any house which does not receive a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava in the manner already explained in the previous verse is to be considered the residential quarters of venomous serpents. It is said that around the sandalwood tree, which is a very valuable tree, there is a venomous serpent. Sandalwood is very cold, and venomous serpents, because of their poisonous teeth, are always very warm, and they take shelter of the sandalwood trees to become cooler. Similarly, there are many rich men who keep watchdogs or doormen and put up signs that say \u201cDo not enter,\u201d \u201cTrespassers not allowed,\u201d \u201cBeware of the dog,\u201d etc. Sometimes in Western countries a trespasser is shot, and there is no crime in such shooting. This is the position of demoniac householders, and such houses are considered to be the residential quarters of venomous snakes. The members of such families are no better than snakes because snakes are very much envious, and when that envy is directed to the saintly persons, their position becomes more dangerous. It is said by C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita that there are two envious living entities \u2014 the snake and the envious man. The envious man is more dangerous than a snake because a snake can be subdued by charming mantras or by some herbs, but an envious person cannot be pacified by any means."

He welcomed them, saying: From the beginning of your birth you strictly observed the vows of celibacy, and although you are experienced in the path of liberation, you are keeping yourselves just like small children.",
        "purport": " The specific importance of the Kum\u0101ras is that they were brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, living the life of celibacy from birth. They kept themselves as small children about four or five years old because by growing into youth one\u2019s senses sometimes become disturbed and celibacy becomes difficult. The Kum\u0101ras therefore purposefully remained children because in a child\u2019s life the senses are never disturbed by sex. This is the significance of the life of the Kum\u0101ras, and as such Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu addressed them as the best of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Not only were the Kum\u0101ras born of the best br\u0101hma\u1e47a (Lord Brahm\u0101), but they are addressed herein as dvija-\u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u1e25, \u201cthe best of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as,\u201d on account of their being Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas also. As we have already explained, they have their samprad\u0101ya (disciplic succession), and even to date the samprad\u0101ya is being maintained and is known as the Nimb\u0101rka samprad\u0101ya. Out of the four samprad\u0101yas of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas, the Nimb\u0101rka samprad\u0101ya is one. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu specifically appreciated the position of the Kum\u0101ras because they maintained the brahmacarya vow from the very beginning of their birth. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, however, expressed his great appreciation of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avism by addressing the Kum\u0101ras as vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-\u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u1e25. In other words, everyone should offer respect to a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava without considering his source of birth. Vai\u1e63\u1e47ave j\u0101ti-buddhi\u1e25: no one should consider a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava in terms of birth. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always the best of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and as such one should offer all respects to a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, not only as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a but as the best of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as."

        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu did not ask the Kum\u0101ras about their good fortune, for the Kum\u0101ras are always auspicious by dint of their life in celibacy. Since they are always engaged on the path of liberation, there was no question of ill fortune. In other words, br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas who are strictly following the path of spiritual advancement are always fortunate. The question was asked by P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja for his own sake, since he was in the position of a g\u1e5bhastha and in charge of the royal authority. Kings are not only g\u1e5bhasthas, who are generally absorbed in sense gratification, but are sometimes employed to kill animals in hunting because they have to practice the killing art; otherwise it is very difficult for them to fight their enemies. Such things are not auspicious. Four kinds of sinful activities \u2014 associating with woman for illicit sex, eating meat, intoxication and gambling \u2014 are allowed for the k\u1e63atriyas. For political reasons, sometimes they have to take to these sinful activities. K\u1e63atriyas do not refrain from gambling. One vivid example is the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. When the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were challenged by the opposite party, Duryodhana, to gamble and risk their kingdom, they could not refrain, and by that gambling they lost their kingdom, and their wife was insulted. Similarly, the k\u1e63atriyas cannot refrain from fighting if challenged by the opposite party. Therefore P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, taking consideration of all these facts, inquired whether there is any auspicious path. G\u1e5bhastha life is inauspicious because g\u1e5bhastha means consciousness for sense gratification, and as soon as there is sense gratification, one\u2019s position is always full of dangers. This material world is said to be pada\u1e41 pada\u1e41 yad vipad\u0101\u1e41 na te\u1e63\u0101m, dangerous in every step (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.58). Everyone in this material world is struggling hard for sense gratification. Clearing all these points, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu inquired from the four Kum\u0101ras about the fallen conditioned souls who are rotting in this material world due to their past bad or inauspicious activities: \u201cIs there any possibility for their auspicious spiritual life?\u201d In this verse, the word indriy\u0101rth\u0101rtha-vedin\u0101m is very significant. It indicates persons whose only aim is to satisfy the senses. They are also described as patit\u0101n\u0101m, or fallen. Only one who stops all activities for sense gratification is considered to be elevated. Another significant word is sva-karmabhi\u1e25. One becomes fallen by dint of his own past bad activities. Everyone is responsible for his fallen condition because of his own activities. When activities are changed to devotional service, one\u2019s auspicious life begins."

        "purport": " In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Antya 4.176) it is said: In this material world the auspicious and inauspicious are simply mental concoctions because such things exist only due to association with the material world. This is called illusion, or \u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101. We think ourselves created by material nature exactly as we think ourselves experiencing so many things in a dream. The spirit soul, however, is always transcendental. There is no question of becoming materially covered. This covering is simply something like a hallucination or a dream. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.62) it is also said, sa\u1e45g\u0101t sa\u00f1j\u0101yate k\u0101ma\u1e25: simply by association we create artificial material necessities. Dhy\u0101yato vi\u1e63ay\u0101n pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 sa\u1e45gas te\u1e63\u016bpaj\u0101yate: when we forget our real constitutional position and wish to enjoy the material resources, our material desires manifest, and we associate with varieties of material enjoyment. As soon as the concoctions of material enjoyment are there, because of our association we create a sort of lust or eagerness to enjoy them, and when that false enjoyment does not actually make us happy, we create another illusion, known as anger, and by the manifestation of anger, the illusion becomes stronger. When we are illusioned in this way, forgetfulness of our relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a follows, and by thus losing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, our real intelligence is defeated. In this way we become entangled in this material world. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.63) it is said: By material association we lose our spiritual consciousness; consequently there is the question of the auspicious and inauspicious. But those who are \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma, or self-realized, have transcended such questions. The \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101mas, or self-realized persons, gradually making further progress in spiritual bliss, come to the platform of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the perfection of life. In the beginning, the Kum\u0101ras were self-realized impersonalists, but gradually they became attracted to the personal pastimes of the Supreme Lord. The conclusion is that for those who are always engaged in the devotional service of the Personality of Godhead, the duality of the auspicious and inauspicious does not arise. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is therefore asking about auspiciousness not for the sake of the Kum\u0101ras but for his own sake."

        "purport": " When saintly persons go from door to door to see those who are too much materially engaged, it is to be understood that they do not go to ask anything for their personal benefit. It is a fact that saintly persons go to materialists just to give real information of the auspicious. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was assured of this fact; therefore instead of wasting time by asking the Kum\u0101ras about their welfare, he preferred to inquire from them whether he could soon be relieved from the dangerous position of materialistic existence. This was not, however, a question personally for P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. It was raised to teach the common man that whenever one meets a great saintly person, one should immediately surrender unto him and inquire about relief from the material pains of existence. Therefore \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says, sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vi\u1e63\u0101nale, div\u0101-ni\u015bi hiy\u0101 jvale, ju\u1e0d\u0101ite n\u0101 kainu up\u0101ya: \u201cWe are always suffering from material pangs, and our hearts are burning, but we cannot find any way out of it.\u201d The materialistic person can also be called a tapasv\u012b, which means someone who is always suffering from material pains. One can get rid of all these material pains only when he takes shelter of the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. This is also explained by Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura: golokera prema-dhana, hari-n\u0101ma-sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, rati n\u0101 janmila kene t\u0101ya. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura regretted that he did not pursue his attraction for the transcendental vibration of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. The conclusion is that all persons in this material world are suffering from material pains, and if one wants to get rid of them he must associate with saintly persons, pure devotees of the Lord, and chant the mah\u0101-mantra: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. That is the only auspicious way for materialistic persons."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always anxious to elevate the living entities, who are His parts and parcels, and for their special benefit the Lord travels all over the world in the form of self-realized persons like you.",
        "purport": " There are different kinds of transcendentalists, namely the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, or impersonalists, the mystic yog\u012bs and, of course, all the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Kum\u0101ras, however, were both yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and finally bhaktas later on. In the beginning they were impersonalists, but later they developed devotional activities; therefore they are the best of the transcendentalists. The devotees are representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and to elevate the conditioned souls to their original consciousness, they travel all over the universes to enlighten the conditioned souls about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The best devotees are \u0101tmavat, or those who have fully realized the Supreme Soul. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, as Param\u0101tm\u0101, is sitting within everyone\u2019s heart, trying to elevate everyone to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore He is called \u0101tma-bh\u0101vana. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always trying to give the individual soul the intelligence to understand about Himself. He is always with the individual as a friend sitting by the side of a friend, and He gives facilities to all living entities according to their desires. The word \u0101tmavat\u0101m is significant in this verse. There are three different kinds of devotees, namely kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b, madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b and uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b \u2014 the neophyte, the preacher and the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, or the highly advanced devotee. The highly advanced devotee is one who knows the conclusion of the Vedas in full knowledge; thus he becomes a devotee. Indeed, not only is he convinced himself, but he can convince others on the strength of Vedic evidence. The advanced devotee can also see all other living entities as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, without discrimination. The madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b (preacher) is also well versed in the \u015b\u0101stras and can convince others also, but he discriminates between the favorable and the unfavorable. In other words, the madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b does not care for the demoniac living entities, and the neophyte kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b does not know much about \u015b\u0101stra but has full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Kum\u0101ras, however, were mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavatas because after scrutinizingly studying the Absolute Truth, they became devotees. In other words, they were in full knowledge of the Vedic conclusion. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is confirmed by the Lord that there are many devotees but that a devotee who is fully conversant in the Vedic conclusion is very dear to Him. Everyone is trying to elevate himself to the highest position according to his mentality. The karm\u012bs, who have a bodily concept of life, try to enjoy sense gratification to the utmost. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs\u2019 idea of the highest position is merging into the effulgence of the Lord. But a devotee\u2019s highest position is in preaching all over the world the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the devotees are actually the representatives of the Supreme Lord, and as such they travel all over the world directly as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a because they carry N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a within their hearts and preach His glories. The representative of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is as good as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, but he is not to conclude, like the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, that he has become N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Generally, a sanny\u0101s\u012b is addressed as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs. Their idea is that simply by taking sanny\u0101sa one becomes equal to N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a or becomes N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a Himself. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava conclusion is different, as stated by \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura: According to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy, a devotee is as good as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a not by becoming N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a but by becoming the most confidential servant of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Such great personalities act as spiritual masters for the benefit of the people in general, and as such, a spiritual master who is preaching the glories of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a should be accepted as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and be given all respects due Him."

        "purport": " Hearing discussions among the devotees is the only means to receive the powerful message of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For instance, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has been well known all over the world for a very long time, especially in the Western world, but because the subject matter was not discussed by devotees, there was no effect. Not a single person in the West became K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious before the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement was founded. But when the same Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was presented as it is through the disciplic succession, the effect of spiritual realization was immediately manifested. Sanat-kum\u0101ra, one of the Kum\u0101ras, informed P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that his meeting with the Kum\u0101ras benefited not only Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu but the Kum\u0101ras as well. When N\u0101rada Muni questioned Lord Brahm\u0101 about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Brahm\u0101 thanked N\u0101rada Muni for giving him a chance to speak about the Supreme Lord. Therefore questions put by a saintly person to another saintly person about the Supreme Personality of Godhead or about the ultimate goal of life surcharge everything spiritually. Whoever takes advantage of such discussions is benefited both in this life and in the next. The word ubhaye\u1e63\u0101m can be described in many ways. Generally there are two classes of men, the materialists and the transcendentalists. By hearing discussions between devotees, both the materialist and transcendentalist are benefited. The materialist is benefited by association with devotees because his life then becomes regulated so that his chance of becoming a devotee or making the present life successful for understanding the real position of the living entity is increased. When one takes advantage of this opportunity, he is assured of a human form of life in the next birth, or he may be liberated completely and go back home, back to Godhead. The conclusion is that if one participates in a discussion of devotees, he is both materially and spiritually benefited.

The discussion of spiritual matters amongst devotees is beneficial for everyone, without exception.

As silver becomes shiny by being polished, the heart of a materialistic person is cleansed of lusty desires by the good association of devotees. Actually the living being has no connection with this material enjoyment nor with lusty desires. He is simply imagining or dreaming while asleep. But by the association of pure devotees he is awakened, and immediately the spirit soul is situated in his own glory by understanding his constitutional position as the eternal servant of the Lord. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was already a self-realized soul; therefore he had a natural inclination to glorify the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the Kum\u0101ras assured him that there was no chance of his falling victim to the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord. In other words, the process of hearing and chanting about the glories of the Lord is the only means to clarify the heart of material contamination. By the process of karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga, no one will succeed in driving away contamination from the heart, but once a person takes to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord by devotional service, automatically all dirty things in the heart are removed without difficulty."

        "translation": "It has been conclusively decided in the scriptures, after due consideration, that the ultimate goal for the welfare of human society is detachment from the bodily concept of life and increased and steadfast attachment for the Supreme Lord, who is transcendental, beyond the modes of material nature.",
        "purport": " Everyone in human society is engaged for the ultimate benefit of life, but persons who are in the bodily conception cannot achieve the ultimate goal, nor can they understand what it is. The ultimate goal of life is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.59): para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate. When one finds out the supreme goal of life, he naturally becomes detached from the bodily concept. Here in this verse the indication is that one has to steadfastly increase attachment for the Transcendence (brahma\u1e47i). As confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (1.1.1), ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101: without inquiry about the Supreme, or the Transcendence, one cannot give up attachment for this material world. By the evolutionary process in 8,400,000 species of life, one cannot understand the ultimate goal of life because in all those species of life, the bodily conception is very prominent. Ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101 means that in order to get out of the bodily conception, one has to increase attachment to or inquiry about Brahman. Then he can be situated in the transcendental devotional service \u2014 \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. To increase attachment for Brahman means to engage in devotional service. Those who are attached to the impersonal form of Brahman cannot remain attached for very long. Impersonalists, after rejecting this world as mithy\u0101, or false (jagan mithy\u0101), come down again to this jagan mithy\u0101, although they take sanny\u0101sa to increase their attachment for Brahman. Similarly, many yog\u012bs who are attached to the localized aspect of Brahman as Param\u0101tm\u0101 \u2014 great sages like Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra \u2014 also fall down as victims of women. Therefore increased attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead is advised in all \u015b\u0101stras. That is the only way of detachment from material existence and is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.59) as para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate: one can cease material activities when he actually has the taste for devotional service. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also recommended love of Godhead as the ultimate goal of life (prem\u0101 pum-artho mah\u0101n). Without increasing love of Godhead, one cannot achieve the perfectional stage of the transcendental position."

These actions are pious in themselves.",
        "purport": " The word yoge\u015bvara is applicable to both the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His devotees also. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this word occurs in two places. In the Eighteenth Chapter (18.78), K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, who is the master of all mystic power (yatra yoge\u015bvara\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25). Yoge\u015bvara is also described at the end of the Sixth Chapter (6.47): sa me yuktatamo mata\u1e25. This yuktatama indicates the topmost of all yog\u012bs \u2014 the devotees, who can also be called yoge\u015bvara. In this verse, yoge\u015bvara-up\u0101san\u0101 means to render service to a pure devotee. Thus Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says, ch\u0101\u1e0diy\u0101 vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-sev\u0101 nist\u0101ra p\u0101yeche keb\u0101: without serving a pure devotee, one cannot advance in spiritual life. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja also has said: One should take shelter of a pure devotee, who has nothing to do with this material world but is simply engaged in devotional service. By serving him only, one can transcend the qualitative material condition. In this verse it is recommended (yoge\u015bvara-up\u0101sanay\u0101) that one serve the lotus feet of the topmost yog\u012b, or the devotee. To serve the topmost devotee means to hear from him about the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To hear the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the mouth of a pure devotee is to acquire a pious life. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.28) it is also said that without being pious one cannot engage in devotional service: To become fixed in devotional service one has to become completely cleansed from the contamination of the material modes of nature. For work in devotional service the first item is \u0101dau gurv-\u0101\u015brayam: one should accept a bona fide spiritual master, and from the bona fide spiritual master inquire about one\u2019s transcendental occupational duties (sad-dharma-p\u1e5bcch\u0101) and follow in the footsteps of great saintly persons, devotees (s\u0101dhu-m\u0101rga-anugamanam). These are the instructions given in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b. The conclusion is that to increase attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead one has to accept a bona fide spiritual master and learn from him the methods of devotional service and hear from him about the transcendental message and glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this way one has to increase his conviction about devotional service. Then it will be very easy to increase attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

The number of materialistic persons in this Age of Kali has increased more than in any other age; therefore persons who are interested in going back home, back to Godhead, should not only engage in the service of realized souls but should give up the company of materialistic persons, whose only aim is to earn money and employ it in sense gratification. They should also not accept the objectives of materialistic persons, namely money and sense gratification. Therefore it is stated, bhakti\u1e25 pare\u015b\u0101nubhavo viraktir anyatra ca (Bh\u0101g. 11.2.42): to advance in devotional service one should be uninterested in the materialistic way of life. That which is the subject matter of satisfaction for the devotees is of no interest to the nondevotees. Simple negation, or giving up the company of materialistic persons, will not do. We must have engagements. Sometimes it is found that a person interested in spiritual advancement gives up the company of material society and goes to a secluded place as recommended for the yog\u012bs especially, but that will also not help a person in spiritual advancement, for in many instances such yog\u012bs also fall down. As far as j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are concerned, generally they fall down without taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. The impersonalists or the voidists can simply avoid the positive material association; they cannot remain fixed in transcendence without being engaged in devotional service. The beginning of devotional service is to hear about the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is recommended in this verse: vin\u0101 harer gu\u1e47a-p\u012by\u016b\u1e63a-p\u0101n\u0101t. One must drink the nectar of the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and this means that one must be always engaged in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. It is the prime method for advancing in spiritual life. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also recommends this in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta. If one wants to make advancement in spiritual life, by great fortune he may meet a bona fide spiritual master and from him learn about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By serving both the spiritual master and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he gets the seed of devotional service (bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja), and if he sows the seed within his heart and waters it by hearing and chanting, it grows into a luxuriant bhakti-lat\u0101, or bhakti creeper. The creeper is so strong that it penetrates the covering of the universe and reaches the spiritual world and continues to grow on and on until it reaches and takes shelter of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as an ordinary creeper also grows on and on until it takes a solid shelter on a roof; then it very steadily grows and produces the required fruit. The real cause of the growing of such fruit, which is here called the nectar of hearing the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is to water the creeper of devotional service by hearing and chanting. The purport is that one cannot live outside the society of devotees; one must live in the association of devotees, where there is constant chanting and hearing of the glories of the Lord. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is started for this purpose, so that hundreds of ISKCON centers may give people a chance to hear and chant, to accept the spiritual master and to disassociate themselves from persons who are materially interested, for in this way one can make solid advancement in going back home, back to Godhead."

        "translation": "A candidate for spiritual advancement must be nonviolent, must follow in the footsteps of great \u0101c\u0101ryas, must always remember the nectar of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, must follow the regulative principles without material desire and, while following the regulative principles, should not blaspheme others. A devotee should lead a very simple life and not be disturbed by the duality of opposing elements. He should learn to tolerate them.",
        "purport": " The devotees are actually saintly persons, or s\u0101dhus. The first qualification of a s\u0101dhu, or devotee, is ahi\u1e41s\u0101, or nonviolence. Persons interested in the path of devotional service, or in going back home, back to Godhead, must first practice ahi\u1e41s\u0101, or nonviolence. A s\u0101dhu is described as titik\u1e63ava\u1e25 k\u0101ru\u1e47ik\u0101\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 3.25.21): a devotee should be tolerant and should be very much compassionate toward others. For example, if he suffers personal injury he should tolerate it, but if someone else suffers injury the devotee need not tolerate it. The whole world is full of violence, and a devotee\u2019s first business is to stop this violence, including the unnecessary slaughter of animals. A devotee is the friend not only of human society but of all living entities, for he sees all living entities as sons of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He does not claim himself to be the only son of God and allow all others to be killed, thinking that they have no soul. This kind of philosophy is never advocated by a pure devotee of the Lord. Suh\u1e5bda\u1e25 sarva-dehin\u0101m: a true devotee is the friend of all living entities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a claims in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to be the father of all species of living entities; consequently the devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always a friend of all. This is called ahi\u1e41s\u0101. Such nonviolence can be practiced only when we follow in the footsteps of great \u0101c\u0101ryas. Therefore, according to our Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy, we have to follow the great \u0101c\u0101ryas of the four samprad\u0101yas, or disciplic successions. Trying to advance in spiritual life outside the disciplic succession is simply ludicrous. It is said, therefore, \u0101c\u0101ryav\u0101n puru\u1e63o veda: one who follows the disciplic succession of \u0101c\u0101ryas knows things as they are (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 6.14.2). Tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet: in order to understand the transcendental science, one must approach the bona fide spiritual master (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.2.12). The word sm\u1e5bty\u0101 is very important in spiritual life. Sm\u1e5bty\u0101 means remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always. Life should be molded in such a way that one cannot remain alone without thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We should live in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that while eating, sleeping, walking and working we remain only in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness society recommends that we arrange our living so that we can remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In our ISKCON society the devotees, while engaged in making Spiritual Sky incense, are also hearing about the glories of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His devotees. The \u015b\u0101stra recommends, smartavya\u1e25 satata\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25: Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u should be remembered always, constantly. Vismartavyo na j\u0101tucit: Vi\u1e63\u1e47u should never be forgotten. That is the spiritual way of life \u2014 sm\u1e5bty\u0101. This remembrance of the Lord can be continued if we hear about Him constantly. It is therefore recommended in this verse: mukund\u0101carit\u0101grya-s\u012bdhun\u0101. S\u012bdhu means \u201cnectar.\u201d To hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam or Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or similar authentic literature is to live in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such concentration in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can be achieved by persons who are strictly following the rules and regulative principles. We have recommended in our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement that a devotee chant sixteen rounds on beads daily and follow the regulative principles. That will help the devotee be fixed in his spiritual advancement in life. It is also stated in this verse that one can advance by controlling the senses (yamai\u1e25). By controlling the senses, one can become a sv\u0101m\u012b or gosv\u0101m\u012b. One who is therefore enjoying this supertitle, sv\u0101m\u012b or gosv\u0101m\u012b, must be very strict in controlling his senses. Indeed, he must be master of his senses. This is possible when one does not desire any material sense gratification. If, by chance, the senses want to work independently, he must control them. If we simply practice avoiding material sense gratification, controlling the senses is automatically achieved. Another important point mentioned in this connection is aninday\u0101 \u2014 we should not criticize others\u2019 methods of religion. There are different types of religious systems operating under different qualities of material nature. Those operating in the modes of ignorance and passion cannot be as perfect as that system in the mode of goodness. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 everything has been divided into three qualitative divisions; therefore religious systems are similarly categorized. When people are mostly under the modes of passion and ignorance, their system of religion will be of the same quality. A devotee, instead of criticizing such systems, will encourage the followers to stick to their principles so that gradually they can come to the platform of religion in goodness. Simply by criticizing them, a devotee\u2019s mind will be agitated. Thus a devotee should tolerate and learn to stop agitation. Another feature of the devotee is nir\u012bhay\u0101, simple living. Nir\u012bh\u0101 means \u201cgentle,\u201d \u201cmeek\u201d or \u201csimple.\u201d A devotee should not live very gorgeously and imitate a materialistic person. Plain living and high thinking are recommended for a devotee. He should accept only so much as he needs to keep the material body fit for the execution of devotional service. He should not eat or sleep more than is required. Simply eating for living, and not living for eating, and sleeping only six to seven hours a day are principles to be followed by devotees. As long as the body is there it is subjected to the influence of climatic changes, disease and natural disturbances, the threefold miseries of material existence. We cannot avoid them. Sometimes we receive letters from neophyte devotees questioning why they have fallen sick, although pursuing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They should learn from this verse that they have to become tolerant (dvandva-titik\u1e63ay\u0101). This is the world of duality. One should not think that because he has fallen sick he has fallen from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can continue without impediment from any material opposition. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore advises in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14), t\u0101\u1e41s titik\u1e63asva bh\u0101rata: \u201cMy dear Arjuna, please try to tolerate all these disturbances. Be fixed in your K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities.\u201d"

        "purport": " This verse is especially mentioned to substantiate the devotional process of hearing the subject matter. A devotee does not like to hear anything other than subjects dealing with spiritual activities, or the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We can increase our propensity for devotional service by hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from realized souls. The more we hear from realized souls, the more we make advancement in our devotional life. The more we advance in devotional life, the more we become detached from the material world. The more we become detached from the material world, as advised by Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, the more we increase in attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, a devotee who actually wants to make progress in devotional service and go back home, back to Godhead, must lose interest in sense enjoyment and associating with persons who are after money and sense gratification. This is the advice of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: The word brahma\u1e47i used in this verse is commented upon by the impersonalists or professional reciters of Bh\u0101gavatam, who are mainly advocates of the caste system by demoniac birthright. They say that brahma\u1e47i means the impersonal Brahman. But they cannot conclude this with reference to the context of the words bhakty\u0101 and gu\u1e47\u0101bhidh\u0101nena. According to the impersonalists, there are no transcendental qualities in the impersonal Brahman; therefore we should understand that brahma\u1e47i means \u201cin the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as admitted by Arjuna in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101; therefore wherever the word brahma is used, it must refer to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not to the impersonal Brahman effulgence. Brahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.11). Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n can all be taken in total as Brahman, but when there is reference to the word bhakti or remembrance of the transcendental qualities, this indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not the impersonal Brahman."

        "translation": "Upon becoming fixed in his attachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of the spiritual master and by awakening knowledge and detachment, the living entity, situated within the heart of the body and covered by the five elements, burns up his material surroundings exactly as fire, arising from wood, burns the wood itself.",
        "purport": " It is said that both the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101, the individual soul, and the Param\u0101tm\u0101 live together within the heart. In the Vedic version it is stated, h\u1e5bdi hy ayam \u0101tm\u0101: the soul and Supersoul both live within the heart. The individual soul is liberated when it comes out of the material heart or cleanses the heart to make it spiritualized. The example given here is very appropriate: yonim ivotthito \u2019gni\u1e25. Agni, or fire, comes out of wood, and by it the wood is completely destroyed. Similarly, when a living entity increases his attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is to be considered like fire. A blazing fire is visible by its exhibition of heat and light; similarly, when the living entity within the heart becomes enlightened with full spiritual knowledge and detached from the material world, he burns up his material covering of the five elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air and sky \u2014 and becomes free from the five kinds of material attachments, namely ignorance, false egoism, attachment to the material world, envy and absorption in material consciousness. Therefore pa\u00f1c\u0101tmakam, as mentioned in this verse, refers to either the five elements or the five coverings of material contamination. When these are all burned into ashes by the blazing fire of knowledge and detachment, one is fixed firmly in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unless one takes shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and advances one\u2019s attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by the spiritual master\u2019s instructions, the five coverings of the living entity cannot be removed from the material heart. The living entity is centered within the heart, and to take him away from the heart is to liberate him. This is the process: one must take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and by his instruction increase one\u2019s knowledge in devotional service, become detached from the material world, and thus become liberated. An advanced devotee, therefore, does not live within the material body but within his spiritual body, just as a dry coconut lives detached from the coconut husk even though within the husk. The pure devotee\u2019s body is therefore called cin-maya-\u015bar\u012bra, \u201cspiritualized body.\u201d In other words, a devotee\u2019s body is not connected with material activities, and as such, a devotee is always liberated (brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate), as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26). \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b also confirms this: \u201cWhatever his condition may be, one who is engaged fully with his body, mind and speech in the service of the Lord is liberated, even within this body.\u201d"

        "translation": "When a person becomes devoid of all material desires and liberated from all material qualities, he transcends distinctions between actions executed externally and internally. At that time the difference between the soul and the Supersoul, which was existing before self-realization, is annihilated. When a dream is over, there is no longer a distinction between the dream and the dreamer.",
        "purport": " As described by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam), one must be devoid of all material desires. When a person becomes devoid of all material desires, there is no longer need for speculative knowledge or fruitive activities. In that condition it is to be understood that one is free from the material body. The example is already given above \u2014 a coconut which is dry is loosened from its outward husk. This is the stage of liberation. As said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.10.6), mukti (liberation) means svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25, being situated in one\u2019s own constitutional position. All material desires are present as long as one is in the bodily concept of life, but when one realizes that he is an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his desires are no longer material. A devotee acts in this consciousness. In other words, when material desires in connection with the body are finished, one is actually liberated. When one is liberated from the material qualities, he does not do anything for his personal sense gratification. At that time all activities performed by him are absolute. In the conditioned state there are two kinds of activities: one acts on behalf of the body, and at the same time he acts to become liberated. The devotee, when he is completely free from all material desires or all material qualities, transcends the duality of action for the body and soul. Then the bodily concept of life is completely over. Therefore \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says: When one is completely fixed in the service of the Lord, he is a liberated person in any condition of life. He is called j\u012bvan-mukta\u1e25, liberated even within this body. In such a liberated condition, there is no distinction between actions for sense gratification and actions for liberation. When one is liberated from the desires of sense gratification, he has no longer to suffer the reactions of lamentation or illusion. Activities performed by the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are subject to lamentation and illusion, but a self-realized liberated person acting only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead experiences none. This is the stage of oneness, or merging into the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means that the individual soul, while keeping his individuality, no longer has separate interests. He is fully in the service of the Lord, and he has nothing to do for his personal sense gratification; therefore he sees only the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not himself. His personal interest completely perishes. When a person comes out of a dream, the dream vanishes. While dreaming, a person may consider himself a king and see the royal paraphernalia, his soldiers, etc., but when the dream is over, he does not see anything beyond himself. Similarly, a liberated person understands that he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord acting in accordance with the desire of the Supreme Lord, and as such there is no distinction between himself and the Supreme Lord, although both of them retain their individuality (nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m). This is the perfect conception of oneness in relation to the Supersoul and the soul."

        "purport": " Being covered by material desires, a spirit soul is also considered to be covered by designations belonging to a particular type of body. Thus he considers himself an animal, man, demigod, bird, beast, etc. In so many ways he is influenced by false identification caused by false egotism, and being covered by illusory material desires, he distinguishes between matter and spirit. When one is devoid of such distinctions, there is no longer a difference between matter and spirit. At that time, the spirit is the only predominating factor. As long as one is covered by material desires, he thinks himself the master or the enjoyer. Thus he acts for sense gratification and becomes subjected to material pangs, happiness and distress. But when one is freed from such a concept of life, he is no longer subjected to designations, and he envisions everything as spiritual in connection with the Supreme Lord. This is explained by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.255): The liberated person has no attachment for anything material or for sense gratification. He understands that everything is connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that everything should be engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore he does not give up anything. There is no question of renouncing anything because the paramaha\u1e41sa knows how to engage everything in the service of the Lord. Originally everything is spiritual; nothing is material. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 8.274) also it is explained that a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, a highly advanced devotee, has no material vision: Although he sees trees, mountains, and other living entities moving here and there, he sees all as the creation of the Supreme Lord and, with reference to the context, sees only the creator and not the created. In other words, he no longer distinguishes between the created and the creator. He sees only the Supreme Personality of Godhead in everything. He sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in everything and everything in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is oneness."

The j\u012bvas are vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba expansions; the different incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba expansions. Thus there are different potencies of the Supreme Lord, and there are different expansions of the different potencies. In this way, for different reasons there are different expansions of the same one principle, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This understanding is real knowledge, but when the living entity is covered by the up\u0101dhi, or designated body, he sees differences, exactly as one sees differences in reflections of oneself on water, on oil or in a mirror. When something is reflected on the water, it appears to be moving. When it is reflected on ice, it appears fixed. When it is reflected on oil, it appears hazy. The subject is one, but under different conditions it appears differently. When the qualifying factor is taken away, the whole appears to be one. In other words, when one comes to the paramaha\u1e41sa or perfectional stage of life by practicing bhakti-yoga, he sees only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere. For him there is no other objective. In conclusion, due to different causes, the living entity is visible in different forms as an animal, human being, demigod, tree, etc. Actually every living entity is the marginal potency of the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.18), therefore, it is explained that one who actually sees the spirit soul does not distinguish between a learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a and a dog, an elephant or a cow. Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25 sama-dar\u015bina\u1e25: one who is actually learned sees only the living entity, not the outward covering. Differentiation is therefore the result of different karma, or fruitive activities, and when we stop fruitive activities, turning them into acts of devotion, we can understand that we are not different from anyone else, regardless of the form. This is only possible in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In this movement there are many different races of men from all parts of the world participating, but because they think of themselves as servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they do not differentiate between black and white, yellow and red. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore the only means to make the living entities free of all designations."

This is also how we can indirectly keep our staunch faith in the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the mind is allowed to think of sense gratification continuously, it becomes the cause of our material bondage. If our mind is simply filled with sense gratification, even though we want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, by continuous practice we cannot forget the subject matter of sense gratification. If one takes up the sanny\u0101sa order of life but is not able to control the mind, he will think of objects of sense gratification \u2014 namely family, society, expensive house, etc. Even though he goes to the Him\u0101layas or the forest, his mind will continue thinking of the objects of sense gratification.

The example given here is very appropriate: If a big lake is covered all around by long ku\u015ba grass, just like columns, the waters dry up; similarly, when the big columns of material desire increase, the clear water of consciousness is dried up. Therefore these columns of ku\u015ba grass should be cut or thrown away from the very beginning. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has instructed that if from the very beginning we do not take care of unwanted grass in the paddy fields, the fertilizing agents or water will be used by them, and the paddy plants will dry up. The material desire for sense enjoyment is the cause of our falldown in this material world, and thus we suffer the threefold miseries and continuous birth, death, old age and disease. However, if we turn our desires toward the transcendental loving service of the Lord, our desires become purified. We cannot kill desires. We have to purify them of different designations. If we constantly think of being a member of a particular nation, society or family and continuously think about them, we become very strongly entangled in the conditioned life of birth and death. But if our desires are applied to the service of the Lord, they become purified, and thus we become immediately freed from material contamination."

Thus one loses his real remembrance of his position as part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as a man who sleeps forgets himself. In this way, when the activities of proper consciousness are checked, all the activities of the lost soul are performed on a false basis. At the present moment, human civilization is acting on a false platform of bodily identification; therefore it can be said that the people of the present age have lost their souls, and in this respect they are no better than animals."

Philosophers who support stopping all activities are called \u015b\u016bnyav\u0101d\u012b. By nature\u2019s own way, our activities are to be gradually diverted to devotional service. But there are philosophers who, instead of purifying their activities, try to make everything zero, or void of all activities. This lack of activity is represented by the trees and the hills. This is a kind of punishment inflicted by the laws of nature. If we do not properly execute our mission of life in self-realization, nature\u2019s punishment will render us inactive by putting us in the form of trees and hills. Therefore activities directed toward sense gratification are condemned herein. One who is constantly thinking of activities to earn money and gratify the senses is following a path which is suicidal. Factually all human society is following this path. Some way or other, people are determined to earn money or get money by begging, borrowing or stealing and applying that for sense gratification. Such a civilization is the greatest obstacle in the path of self-realization."

        "purport": " The four principles of life allow one to live according to religious principles, to earn money according to one\u2019s position in society, to allow the senses to enjoy the sense objects according to regulations, and to progress along the path of liberation from this material attachment. As long as the body is there, it is not possible to become completely free from all these material interests. It is not, however, recommended that one act only for sense gratification and earn money for that purpose only, sacrificing all religious principles. At the present moment, human civilization does not care for religious principles. It is, however, greatly interested in economic development without religious principles. For instance, in a slaughterhouse the butchers certainly get money easily, but such business is not based on religious principles. Similarly, there are many nightclubs for sense gratification and brothels for sex. Sex, of course, is allowed in married life, but prostitution is prohibited because all our activities are ultimately aimed at liberation, at freedom from the clutches of material existence. Similarly, although the government may license liquor shops, this does not mean that liquor shops should be opened unrestrictedly and illicit liquor smuggled. Licensing is meant for restricting. No one has to take a license for sugar, wheat or milk because there is no need to restrict these things. In others words, it is advised that one not act in a way that will obstruct the regular process of advancement in spiritual life and liberation. The Vedic process of sense gratification is therefore planned in such a way that one can economically develop and enjoy sense gratification and yet ultimately attain liberation. Vedic civilization offers us all knowledge in the \u015b\u0101stras, and if we live a regulated life under the direction of \u015b\u0101stras and guru, all our material desires will be fulfilled; at the same time we will be able to go forward to liberation."

        "purport": " Mok\u1e63a, or liberation, has to be taken very seriously, even at the sacrifice of the other three items. As advised by S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b in the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, religious principles are not based on success in economic development. Because we are very attached to sense gratification, we go to God, to the temple or churches, for some economic reasons. Then again, economic development does not mean sense gratification. Everything should be adjusted in such a way that we attain liberation. Therefore in this verse, liberation, mok\u1e63a, is stressed. The other three items are material and therefore subject to destruction. Even if somehow we accumulate a great bank balance in this life and possess many material things, everything will be finished with death. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that death is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who ultimately takes away everything acquired by the materialistic person. Foolishly we do not care for this. Foolishly we are not afraid of death, nor do we consider that death will take away everything acquired by the process of dharma, artha and k\u0101ma. By dharma, or pious activities, we may be elevated to the heavenly planets, but this does not mean freedom from the clutches of birth, death, old age and disease. The purport is that we can sacrifice our interests in traivargya \u2014 religious principles, economic development and sense gratification \u2014 but we cannot sacrifice the cause of liberation. Regarding liberation, it is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9), tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti: liberation means that after giving up this body one does not have to accept another material body. To the impersonalists liberation means merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. But factually this is not mok\u1e63a because one has to again fall down into this material world from that impersonal position. One should therefore seek the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engage in His devotional service. That is real liberation. The conclusion is that we should not stress pious activities, economic development and sense gratification, but should concern ourselves with approaching Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in His spiritual planets, of which the topmost is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a lives. Therefore this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is the greatest gift for persons who are actually desiring liberation."

        "translation": "We accept as blessings different states of higher life, distinguishing them from lower states of life, but we should know that such distinctions exist only in relation to the interchange of the modes of material nature. Actually these states of life have no permanent existence, for all of them will be destroyed by the supreme controller.",
        "purport": " In our material existence we accept a higher form of life as a blessing and a lower form as a curse. This distinction of \u201chigher\u201d and \u201clower\u201d only exists as long as the different material qualities (gu\u1e47as) interact. In other words, by our good activities we are elevated to the higher planetary systems or to a higher standard of life (good education, beautiful body, etc.). These are the results of pious activities. Similarly, by impious activities we remain illiterate, get ugly bodies, a poor standard of living, etc. But all these different states of life are under the laws of material nature through the interaction of the qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance. However, all these qualities will cease to act at the time of the dissolution of the entire cosmic manifestation. The Lord therefore says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.16): Even though we elevate ourselves to the highest planetary system by the scientific advancement of knowledge or by the religious principles of life \u2014 great sacrifices and fruitive activities \u2014 at the time of dissolution these higher planetary systems and life on them will be destroyed. In this verse the words \u012b\u015ba-vidhva\u1e41sit\u0101\u015bi\u1e63\u0101m indicate that all such blessings will be destroyed by the supreme controller. We will not be protected. Our bodies, either in this planet or in another planet, will be destroyed, and again we will have to remain for millions of years in an unconscious state within the body of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. And again, when the creation is manifested, we have to take birth in different species of life and begin our activities. Therefore we should not be satisfied simply by a promotion to the higher planetary systems. We should try to get out of the material cosmic manifestation, go to the spiritual world and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is our highest achievement. We should not be attracted by anything material, higher or lower, but should consider them all on the same level. Our real engagement should be in inquiring about the real purpose of life and rendering devotional service to the Lord. Thus we will be eternally blessed in our spiritual activities, full of knowledge and bliss. Regulated human civilization promotes dharma, artha, k\u0101ma and mok\u1e63a. In human society there must be religion. Without religion, human society is only animal society. Economic development and sense gratification must be based on religious principles. When religion, economic development and sense gratification are adjusted, liberation from this material birth, death, old age and disease is assured. In the present Age of Kali, however, there is no question of religion and liberation. People have taken interest only in economic development and sense gratification. Therefore, despite sufficient economic development all over the world, dealings in human society have become almost animalistic. When everything becomes grossly animalistic, dissolution takes place. This dissolution is to be accepted as \u012b\u015ba-vidhva\u1e41sit\u0101\u015bi\u1e63\u0101m: the Lord\u2019s so-called blessings of economic development and sense gratification will be conclusively dissolved by destruction. At the end of this Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as the incarnation of Kalki, and His only business will be to kill all human beings on the surface of the globe. After that killing, another golden age will begin. We should therefore know that our material activities are just like childish play. Children may play on the beach, and the father will sit and watch this childish play \u2014 the construction of buildings with sand, the construction of walls and so many things \u2014 but finally the father will ask the children to come home. Then everything is destroyed. Persons who are too much addicted to the childish activities of economic development and sense gratification are sometimes especially favored by the Lord when He destroys their construction of these things. It is said by the Lord: yasy\u0101ham anug\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101mi hari\u1e63ye tad-dhana\u1e41 \u015banai\u1e25. The Lord told Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that His special favor is shown to His devotee when He takes away all the devotee\u2019s material opulences. Generally, therefore, it is experienced that Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are not very opulent in the material sense. When a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, pure devotee, tries to be materially opulent and at the same time desires to serve the Supreme Lord, his devotional service is checked. The Lord, in order to show him a special favor, destroys his so-called economic development and material opulences. Thus the devotee, being frustrated in his repeated attempts at economic development, ultimately takes solid shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord. This kind of action may also be accepted as \u012b\u015ba-vidhva\u1e41sit\u0101\u015bi\u1e63\u0101m, whereby the Lord destroys one\u2019s material opulences but enriches one in spiritual understanding. In the course of our preaching work, we sometimes see that materialistic persons come to us and offer their obeisances to take blessings, which means they want more and more material opulences. If such material opulences are checked, such persons are no longer interested in offering obeisances to the devotees. Such materialistic persons are always concerned about their economic development. They offer obeisances to saintly persons or the Supreme Lord and give something in charity for preaching work with a view that they will be rewarded with further economic development. However, when one is sincere in his devotional service, the Lord obliges the devotee to give up his material development and completely surrender unto Him. Because the Lord does not give blessings of material opulence to His devotee, people are afraid of worshiping Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u because they see that the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, who are worshipers of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, are poor in superficial material opulences. Such materialistic persons, however, get immense opportunity for economic development by worshiping Lord \u015aiva, for Lord \u015aiva is the husband of the goddess Durg\u0101, the proprietor of this universe. By the grace of Lord \u015aiva, a devotee gets the opportunity to be blessed by the goddess Durg\u0101. R\u0101va\u1e47a, for example, was a great worshiper and devotee of Lord \u015aiva, and in return he got all the blessings of goddess Durg\u0101, so much so that his whole kingdom was constructed of golden buildings. In Brazil, in this present age, huge quantities of gold have been found, and from historical references in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, we can guess safely that this was R\u0101va\u1e47a\u2019s kingdom. This kingdom was, however, destroyed by Lord R\u0101macandra. By studying such incidents, we can understand the full meaning of \u012b\u015ba-vidhva\u1e41sit\u0101\u015bi\u1e63\u0101m. The Lord does not bestow material blessings upon the devotees, for they may be entrapped again in this material world by continuous birth, death, old age and disease. Due to materialistic opulences, persons like R\u0101va\u1e47a become puffed up for sense gratification. R\u0101va\u1e47a even dared kidnap S\u012bt\u0101, who was both the wife of Lord R\u0101macandra and the goddess of fortune, thinking that he would be able to enjoy the pleasure potency of the Lord. But actually, by such action, R\u0101va\u1e47a became vidhva\u1e41sita, or ruined. At the present moment human civilization is too much attached to economic development and sense gratification and is therefore nearing the path of ruination."

        "translation": "Sanat-kum\u0101ra advised the King: Therefore, my dear King P\u1e5bthu, try to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is living within everyone\u2019s heart along with the individual soul, in each and every body, either moving or not moving. The individual souls are fully covered by the gross material body and subtle body made of the life air and intelligence.",
        "purport": " In this verse it is specifically advised that instead of wasting time in the human form of life endeavoring for economic development and sense gratification, one should try to cultivate spiritual values by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is existing with the individual soul within everyone\u2019s heart. The individual soul and the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature are both sitting within this body, which is covered by gross and subtle elements. To understand this is to attain actual spiritual culture. There are two ways of advancing in spiritual culture: by the method of the impersonalist philosophers and by devotional service. The impersonalist comes to the conclusion that he and the Supreme Spirit are one, whereas devotees, or personalists, realize the Absolute Truth by understanding that because the Absolute Truth is the supreme predominator and we living entities are predominated, our duty is to serve Him. The Vedic injunctions say, tat tvam asi, \u201cYou are the same,\u201d and so \u2019ham, \u201cI am the same.\u201d The impersonalist conception of these mantras is that the Supreme Lord, or the Absolute Truth, and the living entity are one, but from the devotee\u2019s point of view these mantras assert that both the Supreme Lord and ourselves are of the same quality. Tat tvam asi; ayam \u0101tm\u0101 brahma. Both the Supreme Lord and the living entity are spirit. Understanding this is self-realization. The human form of life is meant for understanding the Supreme Lord and oneself by spiritual cultivation of knowledge. One should not waste valuable life simply engaged in economic development and sense gratification. In this verse the word k\u1e63etra-vit is also important. This word is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.2): ida\u1e41 \u015bar\u012bra\u1e41 kaunteya k\u1e63etram ity abhidh\u012byate. This body is called k\u1e63etra (the field of activities), and the proprietors of the body (the individual soul and the Supersoul sitting within the body) are both called k\u1e63etra-vit. But there is a difference between the two kinds of k\u1e63etra-vit. One k\u1e63etra-vit, or knower of the body, namely the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supersoul, is directing the individual soul. When we rightly take the direction of the Supersoul, our life becomes successful. He is directing from within and from without. From within He is directing as caitya-guru, or the spiritual master sitting within the heart. Indirectly He is also helping the living entity by manifesting Himself as the spiritual master outside. In both ways the Lord is giving directions to the living entity so that he may finish up his material activities and come back home, back to Godhead. The presence of the Supreme Soul and the individual soul within the body can be perceived by anyone by the fact that as long as the individual soul and the Supersoul are both living within the body, the body is always shining and fresh. But as soon as the Supersoul and the individual soul give up possession of the gross body, it immediately decomposes. One who is spiritually advanced can thus understand the real difference between a dead body and a living body. In conclusion, one should not waste his time by so-called economic development and sense gratification, but should cultivate spiritual knowledge to understand the Supersoul and the individual soul and their relationship. In this way, by advancement of knowledge, one can achieve liberation and the ultimate goal of life. It is said that if one takes to the path of liberation, even rejecting his so-called duties in the material world, he is not a loser at all. But a person who does not take to the path of liberation yet carefully executes economic development and sense gratification loses everything. N\u0101rada\u2019s statement before Vy\u0101sadeva is appropriate in this connection: If a person, out of sentiment or for some other reason, takes to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and in due course of time does not succeed in coming to the ultimate goal of life or falls down due to lack of experience, there is no loss. But for a person who does not take to devotional service yet executes his material duties very nicely, there is no gain."

Thus the Lord is transcendental to all material contamination. Unto Him only must one surrender.",
        "purport": " This verse is specifically stated to defy the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da conclusion of oneness without differentiation between the individual soul and the Supersoul. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da conclusion is that the living entity and the Supersoul are one; there is no difference. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs proclaim that there is no separate existence outside the impersonal Brahman and that the feeling of separation is m\u0101y\u0101, or an illusion, by which one considers a rope to be a snake. The rope-and-the-snake argument is generally offered by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers. Therefore these words, which represent vivarta-v\u0101da, are specifically mentioned herein. Actually Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supersoul, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is eternally liberated. In other words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is living within this body along with the individual soul, and this is confirmed in the Vedas. They are likened to two friends sitting on the same tree. Yet Param\u0101tm\u0101 is above the illusory energy. The illusory energy is called bahira\u1e45g\u0101 \u015bakti, or external energy, and the living entity is called ta\u1e6dasth\u0101 \u015bakti, or marginal potency. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the material energy, represented as earth, water, air, fire, sky, etc., and the spiritual energy, the living entity, are both energies of the Supreme Lord. Even though the energies and the energetic are identical, the living entity, individual soul, being prone to be influenced by the external energy, considers the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be one with himself. The word prapadye is also significant in this verse, for it refers to the conclusion of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. In another place the Lord says, bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate (Bg. 7.19). This prapadye or \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja refers to the individual\u2019s surrender to the Supersoul. The individual soul, when surrendered, can understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although situated within the heart of the individual soul, is superior to the individual soul. The Lord is always transcendental to the material manifestation, even though it appears that the Lord and the material manifestation are one and the same. According to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy, He is one and different simultaneously. The material energy is a manifestation of His external potency, and since the potency is identical with the potent, it appears that the Lord and individual soul are one; but actually the individual soul is under the influence of material energy, and the Lord is always transcendental to it. Unless the Lord is superior to the individual soul, there is no question of prapadye, or surrender unto Him. This word prapadye refers to the process of devotional service. Simply by nondevotional speculation on the rope and the snake, one cannot approach the Absolute Truth. Therefore devotional service is stressed as more important than deliberation or mental speculation to understand the Absolute Truth."

        "translation": "The devotees, who are always engaged in the service of the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord, can very easily overcome hard-knotted desires for fruitive activities. Because this is very difficult, the nondevotees \u2014 the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs \u2014 although trying to stop the waves of sense gratification, cannot do so. Therefore you are advised to engage in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the son of Vasudeva.",
        "purport": " There are three kinds of transcendentalists trying to overcome the influence of the modes of material nature: the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, yog\u012bs and bhaktas. All of them attempt to overcome the influence of the senses, which is compared to the incessant waves of a river. The waves of a river flow incessantly, and it is very difficult to stop them. Similarly, the waves of desire for material enjoyment are so strong that they cannot be stopped by any process other than bhakti-yoga. The bhaktas, by their transcendental devotional service unto the lotus feet of the Lord, become so overwhelmed with transcendental bliss that automatically their desires for material enjoyment stop. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs, who are not attached to the lotus feet of the Lord, simply struggle against the waves of desire. They are described in this verse as rikta-mataya\u1e25, which means \u201cdevoid of devotional service.\u201d In other words, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs, although trying to be free from the desires of material activities, actually become more and more entangled in false philosophical speculation or strenuous attempts to stop the activities of the senses. As stated previously: Here also the same point is stressed. Bhaja v\u0101sudevam indicates that one who is engaged in the loving service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the son of Vasudeva, can very easily stop the waves of desires. As long as one continues to try to artificially stop the waves of desires, he will certainly be defeated. That is indicated in this verse. Desires for fruitive activities are strongly rooted, but the trees of desire can be uprooted completely by devotional service because devotional service employs superior desire. One can give up inferior desires when engaged in superior desires. To try to stop desires is impossible. One has to desire the Supreme in order not to be entangled in inferior desires. J\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs maintain a desire to become one with the Supreme, but such desire is also considered to be k\u0101ma, lust. Similarly, the yog\u012bs desire mystic power, and that is also k\u0101ma. And the bhaktas, not being desirous of any sort of material enjoyment, become purified. There is no artificial attempt to stop desire. Desire becomes a source of spiritual enjoyment under the protection of the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord. It is stated herein by the Kum\u0101ras that the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are the ultimate reservoir of all pleasure. One should therefore take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord instead of trying unsuccessfully to stop desires for material enjoyment. As long as one is unable to stop the desire for material enjoyment, there is no possibility of becoming liberated from the entanglement of material existence. It may be argued that the waves of a river are incessantly flowing and that they cannot be stopped, but the waves of the river flow toward the sea. When the tide comes over the river, it overwhelms the flowing of the river, and the river itself becomes overflooded. Then the waves from the sea become more prominent than the waves from the river. Similarly, a devotee with intelligence plans so many things for the service of the Lord in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness that stagnant material desires become overflooded by the desire to serve the Lord. As confirmed by Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, since he has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord there is always a current of newer and newer desires flowing to serve the Lord, so much so that the stagnant desire of sex life becomes very insignificant. Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya even says that he spits on such desires. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.59) also confirms: para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate. The conclusion is that by developing a loving desire for the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, we subdue all material desires for sense gratification."

Although those who are nondevotees undergo severe austerities and penances to cross that ocean, we recommend that you simply take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, which are like boats for crossing the ocean. Although the ocean is difficult to cross, by taking shelter of His lotus feet you will overcome all dangers.",
        "purport": " Material existence is compared herein to the great ocean of nescience. Another name of this ocean is Vaitara\u1e47\u012b. In that Vaitara\u1e47\u012b Ocean, which is the Causal Ocean, there are innumerable universes floating like footballs. On the other side of the ocean is the spiritual world of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, which is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.20) as paras tasm\u0101t tu bh\u0101vo\u00a0\u2019nya\u1e25. Thus there is an ever-existing spiritual nature which is beyond this material nature. Even though all the material universes are annihilated again and again in the Causal Ocean, the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, which are spiritual, exist eternally and are not subject to dissolution. The human form of life gives the living entity a chance to cross the ocean of nescience, which is this material universe, and enter into the spiritual sky. Although there are many methods or boats by which one can cross the ocean, the Kum\u0101ras recommend that the King take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, just as one would take shelter of a good boat. Nondevotees, who do not take shelter of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, try to cross the ocean of nescience by other methods (karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga), but they have a great deal of trouble. Indeed, sometimes they become so busy simply enjoying their troubles that they never cross the ocean. There is no guarantee that the nondevotees will cross the ocean, but even though they manage to cross, they have to undergo severe austerities and penances. On the other hand, anyone who takes to the process of devotional service and has faith that the lotus feet of the Lord are safe boats to cross that ocean is certain to cross very easily and comfortably. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is therefore advised to take the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord to easily cross over all dangers. Dangerous elements in the universe are compared to sharks in the ocean. Even though one may be a very expert swimmer, he cannot possibly survive if he is attacked by sharks. One often sees that many so-called sv\u0101m\u012bs and yog\u012bs sometimes advertise themselves as competent to cross the ocean of nescience and to help others cross, but in actuality they are found to be simply victims of their own senses. Instead of helping their followers to cross the ocean of nescience, such sv\u0101m\u012bs and yog\u012bs fall prey to m\u0101y\u0101, represented by the fair sex, woman, and are thus devoured by the sharks in that ocean."

        "translation": "The King said: O br\u0101hma\u1e47a, O powerful one, formerly Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u showed me His causeless mercy, indicating that you would come to my house, and to confirm that blessing, you have all come.",
        "purport": " When Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u appeared in the great arena of sacrifice at the time when King P\u1e5bthu was performing a great sacrifice (a\u015bvamedha), He predicted that the Kum\u0101ras would very soon come and advise the King. Therefore P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja remembered the causeless mercy of the Lord and thus welcomed the arrival of the Kum\u0101ras, who were fulfilling the Lord\u2019s prediction. In other words, when the Lord makes a prediction, He fulfills that prediction through some of His devotees. Similarly, Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu predicted that both His glorious names and the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra would be broadcast in all the towns and villages of the world. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura and \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Prabhup\u0101da desired to fulfill this great prediction, and we are following in their footsteps. Regarding His devotees, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told Arjuna, kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, declare it boldly that My devotee will never perish.\u201d (Bg. 9.31) The point is that the Lord Himself could declare such things, but it was His desire to make the declaration through Arjuna and thus doubly assure that His promise would never be broken. The Lord Himself promises, and His confidential devotees execute the promise. The Lord makes so many promises for the benefit of suffering humanity. Although the Lord is very compassionate upon suffering humanity, human beings are generally not very anxious to serve Him. The relationship is something like that between the father and the son; the father is always anxious for the welfare of the son, even though the son forgets or neglects the father. The word anukampin\u0101 is significant; the Lord is so compassionate upon the living entities that He comes Himself into this world in order to benefit fallen souls: \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself.\u201d (Bg. 4.7) Thus it is out of compassion that the Lord appears in His different forms. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared on this planet out of compassion for fallen souls; Lord Buddha appeared out of compassion for the poor animals who were being killed by the demons; Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva appeared out of compassion for Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. The conclusion is that the Lord is so compassionate upon the fallen souls within this material world that He comes Himself or sends His devotees and His servants to fulfill His desire to have all the fallen souls come back home, back to Godhead. Thus Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructed Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to Arjuna for the benefit of the entire human society. Intelligent men should therefore seriously consider this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement and fully utilize the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as preached without adulteration by His pure devotees."

        "purport": " The word s\u0101dh\u016bcchi\u1e63\u1e6dam is significant in this verse. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja got his kingdom from great saintly persons like Bh\u1e5bgu and others just as one gets remnants of food. After the death of King Vena, the whole world was bereft of a popular ruler. There were so many catastrophes occurring that the great saintly persons, headed by Bh\u1e5bgu, created the body of King P\u1e5bthu out of the body of his dead father, King Vena. Since King P\u1e5bthu was thus offered the kingdom by the virtue of the mercy of great saintly persons, he did not want to divide his kingdom among saints like the Kum\u0101ras. When a father is eating food, he may, out of compassion, offer the remnants of his food to his son. Although such food may be already chewed by the father, it cannot be offered to the father again. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s position was something like that: whatever he possessed had already been chewed, and therefore he could not offer it to the Kum\u0101ras. Indirectly, however, he offered everything he possessed to the Kum\u0101ras, and consequently they utilized his possessions in whatever way they liked. The next verse clarifies this matter."

        "purport": " In some readings, the word d\u0101r\u0101\u1e25 is not used, but the word used then is r\u0101ya\u1e25, which means \u201cwealth.\u201d In India there are still wealthy persons who are recognized by the state as r\u0101ya. A great devotee of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was called R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya because he was governor of Madras and very rich. There are still many holders of the title r\u0101ya \u2014 R\u0101ya Bahadur, R\u0101ya Chaudhuri and so on. The d\u0101r\u0101\u1e25, or wife, is not permitted to be offered to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Everything is offered to worthy persons who are able to accept charity, but nowhere is it found that one offers his wife; therefore in this case the reading r\u0101ya\u1e25 is more accurate than d\u0101r\u0101\u1e25. Also, since P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja offered everything to the Kum\u0101ras, the word ko\u015ba\u1e25, \u201ctreasury,\u201d need not be separately mentioned. Kings and emperors used to keep a private treasury which was known as ratna-bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. The ratna-bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da was a special treasury room which contained special jewelries, such as bangles, necklaces and so on, which were presented to the king by the citizens. This jewelry was kept separate from the regular treasury house where all the collected revenues were kept. Thus P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja offered his stock of private jewelry to the lotus feet of the Kum\u0101ras. It has already been admitted that all the King\u2019s property belonged to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and that P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was simply using it for the welfare of the state. If it were actually the property of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, how could it be offered again to them? In this regard, \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has explained that this offering is just like the servant\u2019s offering of food to his master. The food already belongs to the master, for the master has purchased it, but the servant, by preparing food, makes it acceptable to the master and thus offers it to him. In this way, everything belonging to P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was offered to the Kum\u0101ras."

        "purport": " In this verse it is very clearly stated that a kingdom, state or empire must be governed under the instructions of saintly persons and br\u0101hma\u1e47as like the Kum\u0101ras. When monarchy ruled throughout the world, the monarch was actually directed by a board of br\u0101hma\u1e47as and saintly persons. The king, as the administrator of the state, executed his duties as a servant of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. It was not that the kings or br\u0101hma\u1e47as were dictators, nor did they consider themselves proprietors of the state. The kings were also well versed in Vedic literatures and thus were familiar with the injunction of \u015ar\u012b \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad: \u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam \u2014 everything that exists belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also claims that He is the proprietor of all planetary systems (sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram). Since this is the case, no one can claim to be proprietor of the state. The king, president or head of the state should always remember that he is not the proprietor but the servant. In the present age, the king or president forgets that he is the servant of God and thinks of himself as servant of the people. The present democratic government is proclaimed to be a people\u2019s government, a government by the people and for the people, but this type of government is not sanctioned by the Vedas. The Vedas maintain that a kingdom should be governed for the purpose of satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should therefore be ruled by a representative of the Lord. The head of a state should not be appointed if he is bereft of all Vedic knowledge. In this verse it is clearly stated (veda-\u015b\u0101stra-vid arhati) that all high government posts are especially meant for persons who are well conversant with the teachings of the Vedas. In the Vedas there are definite instructions defining how a king, commander-in-chief, soldier and citizen should behave. Unfortunately there are many so-called philosophers in the present age who give instruction without citing authority, and many leaders follow their unauthorized instruction. Consequently people are not happy. The modern theory of dialectical communism, set forth by Karl Marx and followed by communist governments, is not perfect. According to Vedic communism, no one in the state should ever starve. Presently there are many bogus institutions which are collecting funds from the public for the purpose of giving food to starving people, but these funds are invariably misused. According to the Vedic instructions, the government should arrange things in such a way that there will be no question of starvation. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that a householder must see to it that even a lizard or a snake does not starve. They also must be given food. In actuality, however, there is no question of starvation because everything is the property of the Supreme Lord, and He sees to it that there is ample arrangement for feeding everyone. In the Vedas (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13) it is said, eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n: the Supreme Lord supplies the necessities of life to everyone, and there is no question of starvation. If anyone starves, it is due to the mismanagement of the so-called ruler, governor or president. It is clear therefore that a person who is not well versed in the Vedic injunctions (veda-\u015b\u0101stra-vit) should not run for election as president, governor, etc. Formerly kings were r\u0101jar\u1e63is, which meant that although they were serving as kings, they were as good as saintly persons because they would not transgress any of the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures and would rule under the direction of great saintly persons and br\u0101hma\u1e47as. According to this arrangement, modern presidents, governors and chief executive officers are all unworthy of their posts because they are not conversant with Vedic administrative knowledge and they do not take direction from great saintly persons and br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Because of his disobedience to the orders of the Vedas and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, King Vena, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s father, was killed by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore knew very well that it behooved him to rule the planet as the servant of saintly persons and br\u0101hma\u1e47as."

        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped with the words namo brahma\u1e47ya-dev\u0101ya, which indicate that the Supreme Lord accepts the br\u0101hma\u1e47as as worshipable gods. The Supreme Lord is worshiped by everyone, yet to teach others He worships the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Everyone should follow the instructions of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, for their only business is to spread \u015babda-brahma, or Vedic knowledge, all over the world. Whenever there is a scarcity of br\u0101hma\u1e47as to spread Vedic knowledge, chaos throughout human society results. Since br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are direct servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they do not depend on others. In actuality, everything in the world belongs to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and out of their humility the br\u0101hma\u1e47as accept charity from the k\u1e63atriyas, or kings, and the vai\u015byas, or merchants. Everything belongs to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but the k\u1e63atriya government and the mercantile people keep everything in custody, like bankers, and whenever the br\u0101hma\u1e47as need money, the k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas should supply it. It is like a savings account with money which the depositor can draw out at his will. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, being engaged in the service of the Lord, have very little time to handle the finances of the world, and therefore the riches are kept by the k\u1e63atriyas, or the kings, who are to produce money upon the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 demand. Actually the br\u0101hma\u1e47as or Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas do not live at others\u2019 cost; they live by spending their own money, although it appears that they are collecting this money from others. K\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas have no right to give charity, for whatever they possess belongs to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Therefore charity should be given by the k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas under the instructions of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Unfortunately at the present moment there is a scarcity of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and since the so-called k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas do not carry out the orders of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the world is in a chaotic condition. The second line of this verse indicates that the k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras eat only by virtue of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 mercy; in other words, they should not eat anything which is forbidden by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas know what to eat, and by their personal example they do not eat anything which is not offered first to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They eat only pras\u0101da, or remnants of the food offered to the Lord. The k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras should eat only k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101da, which is afforded them by the mercy of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. They cannot open slaughterhouses and eat meat, fish or eggs or drink liquor, or earn money for this purpose without authorization. In the present age, because society is not guided by brahminical instruction, the whole population is only absorbed in sinful activities. Consequently, everyone is deservedly being punished by the laws of nature. This is the situation in this Age of Kali."

Such great personalities can be satisfied only by their own activities, which are distributed amongst human society out of their unlimited mercy.",
        "purport": " Great personalities of the material world are very eager to render welfare service to human society, but actually no one can render better service than one who distributes the knowledge of spiritual realization in relation with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All living entities are within the clutches of the illusory energy. Forgetting their real identity, they hover in material existence, transmigrating from one body to another in search of a peaceful life. Since these living entities have very little knowledge of self-realization, they are not getting any relief, although they are very anxious to attain peace of mind and some substantial happiness. Saintly persons like the Kum\u0101ras, N\u0101rada, Prahl\u0101da, Janaka, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Kapiladeva, as well as the followers of such authorities as the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas and their servants, can render a valuable service to humanity by disseminating knowledge of the relationship between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity. Such knowledge is the perfect benediction for humanity. Knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is such a great gift that it is impossible to repay the benefactor. Therefore P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja requested the Kum\u0101ras to be satisfied by their own benevolent activities in delivering souls from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. The King saw that there was no other way to satisfy them for their exalted activities. The word vinoda-p\u0101tram can be divided into two words, vin\u0101 and uda-p\u0101tram, or can be understood as one word, vinoda-p\u0101tram, which means \u201cjoker.\u201d A joker\u2019s activities simply arouse laughter, and a person who tries to repay the spiritual master or teacher of the transcendental message of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes a laughingstock just like a joker because it is not possible to repay such a debt. The best friend and benefactor of all people is one who awakens humanity to its original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was a responsible monarch, and he had to execute the duties of a k\u1e63atriya, a king and a devotee at the same time. Being perfect in the Lord\u2019s devotional service, he could execute his prescribed duties with complete perfection as befitted the time and circumstance and his financial strength and personal ability. In this regard, the word karm\u0101\u1e47i in this verse is significant. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s activities were not ordinary, for they were in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has advised that things which are favorable to devotional service should not be rejected, nor should activity favorable for devotional service be considered ordinary work or fruitive activity. For example, an ordinary worker conducts business in order to earn money for his sense gratification. A devotee may perform the same work in exactly the same way, but his aim is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. Consequently his activities are not ordinary. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s activities were therefore not ordinary but were all spiritual and transcendental, for his aim was to satisfy the Lord. Just as Arjuna, who was a warrior, had to fight to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja performed his royal duties as king for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Indeed, whatever he did as emperor of the whole world was perfectly befitting a pure devotee. It is therefore said by a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava poet, vai\u1e63\u1e47avera kriy\u0101-mudr\u0101 vij\u00f1e n\u0101 bujh\u0101ya: no one can understand the activities of a pure devotee. A pure devotee\u2019s activities may appear like ordinary activities, but behind them there is profound significance \u2014 the satisfaction of the Lord. In order to understand the activities of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, one has to become very expert. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu did not allow himself to function outside the institution of four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas, although as a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava he was a paramaha\u1e41sa, transcendental to all material activities. He remained in his position as a k\u1e63atriya to rule the world and at the same time remained transcendental to such activities by satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Concealing himself as a pure devotee, he externally manifested himself as a very powerful and dutiful king. In other words, none of his activities were carried out for his own sense gratification; everything he did was meant for the satisfaction of the senses of the Lord. This is clearly explained in the next verse."

Consequently all the fruits of his activities were dedicated to the Lord, and he always thought of himself as the servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the proprietor of everything.",
        "purport": " The life and dedication of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead serve as a good example of karma-yoga. The term karma-yoga is often used in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and herein Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu is giving a practical example of what karma-yoga actually is. The first requirement for the proper execution of karma-yoga is given herein. Phala\u1e41 brahma\u1e47i sannyasya (or vinyasya): one must give the fruits of his activities to the Supreme Brahman, Parabrahman, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By doing so, one actually situates himself in the renounced order of life, sanny\u0101sa. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.2), giving up the fruits of one\u2019s activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called sanny\u0101sa: \u201cTo give up the results of all activities is called renunciation [ty\u0101ga] by the wise. And that state is called the renounced order of life [sanny\u0101sa] by great learned men.\u201d Although he was living as a householder, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was actually in the renounced order of life, sanny\u0101sa. This will be clearer in the following verses. The word nirvi\u1e63a\u1e45ga\u1e25, \u201cuncontaminated,\u201d is very significant because Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was not attached to the results of his activities. In this material world a person is always thinking of the proprietorship of everything he accumulates or works for. When the fruits of one\u2019s activities are rendered to the service of the Lord, one is actually practicing karma-yoga. Anyone can practice karma-yoga, but it is especially easy for the householder, who can install the Deity of the Lord in the home and worship Him according to the methods of bhakti-yoga. This method includes nine items: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping the Deity, praying, carrying out orders, serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as friend and sacrificing everything for Him: These methods of karma-yoga and bhakti-yoga are being broadcast all over the world by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Anyone can learn these methods simply by following the examples of the members of the Society. In one\u2019s home or in a temple, the Deity is considered the proprietor of everything, and everyone is considered the Deity\u2019s eternal servant. The Lord is transcendental, for He is not part of this material creation. The words prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 param are used in this verse because everything within this material world is created by the external, material energy of the Lord, but the Lord Himself is not a creation of this material energy. The Lord is the supreme superintendent of all material creations, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10): \u201cThis material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt\u012b, producing all the moving and unmoving beings, and by its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.\u201d All material changes and material progress taking place by the wonderful interaction of matter are under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Events in the material world are not taking place blindly. If one always remains a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engages everything in His service, one is accepted as j\u012bvan-mukta, a liberated soul, even during his lifetime within the material world. Generally liberation takes place after one gives up this body, but one who lives according to the example of P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is liberated even in this lifetime. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness the results of one\u2019s activities depend on the will of the Supreme Person. Indeed, in all cases the result is not dependent on one\u2019s own personal dexterity but is completely dependent on the will of the Supreme. This is the real significance of phala\u1e41 brahma\u1e47i sannyasya. A soul dedicated to the service of the Lord should never think of himself as the personal proprietor or the superintendent. A dedicated devotee should prosecute his work according to the rules and regulations described in devotional service. The results of his activities are completely dependent on the supreme will of the Lord."

Since he was never inclined to utilize his opulences for the gratification of his senses, he remained unattached, exactly like the sun, which is unaffected in all circumstances.",
        "purport": " The word g\u1e5bhe\u1e63u is significant in this verse. Out of the four \u0101\u015bramas \u2014 the brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa \u2014 only a g\u1e5bhastha, or householder, is allowed to associate with women; therefore the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama is a kind of license for sense gratification given to the devotee. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was special in that although he was given license to remain a householder, and although he possessed immense opulences in his kingdom, he never engaged in sense gratification. This was a special sign that indicated him to be a pure devotee of the Lord. A pure devotee is never attracted by sense gratification, and consequently he is liberated. In material life a person engages in sense gratification for his own personal satisfaction, but in the devotional or liberated life one aims to satisfy the senses of the Lord. In this verse Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu is likened to the sun (arka-vat). Sometimes the sun shines on stool, urine and so many other polluted things, but since the sun is all-powerful, it is never affected by the polluted things with which it associates. On the contrary, the sunshine sterilizes and purifies polluted and dirty places. Similarly, a devotee may engage in so many material activities, but because he has no desire for sense gratification, they never affect him. On the contrary, he dovetails all material activities for the service of the Lord. Since a pure devotee knows how to utilize everything for the Lord\u2019s service, he is never affected by material activities. Instead, by his transcendental plans he purifies such activities. This is described in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu. Sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41 tat-paratvena nirmalam: his aim is to become completely purified in the service of the Lord without being affected by material designations."

They were not born whimsically or by accident. How one can beget children according to one\u2019s own desire is practically unknown in the present age, Kali-yuga. In this regard the secret of success depends on the parents\u2019 acceptance of the various purificatory methods known as sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras. The first sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, or child-begetting sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, is compulsory, especially for the higher castes, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the k\u1e63atriyas. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sex life which is not against religious principles is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, and according to religious principles, when one wants to beget a child he must perform the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra before having sex. The mental state of the father and mother before sex will certainly affect the mentality of the child to be begotten. A child who is begotten out of lust may not turn out as the parents desire. As stated in the \u015b\u0101stras, yath\u0101 yonir yath\u0101 b\u012bjam. Yath\u0101 yoni\u1e25 indicates the mother, and yath\u0101 b\u012bjam indicates the father. If the mental state of the parents is prepared before they have sex, the child which they will beget will certainly reflect their mental condition. It is therefore understood by the words \u0101tma-sammat\u0101n that both P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Arci underwent the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na purificatory process before begetting children, and thus they begot all their sons according to their desires and purified mental states. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not beget his children out of lust, nor was he attracted to his wife for sense gratificatory purposes. He begot the children as a g\u1e5bhastha for the future administration of his government all over the world."

The Vedic literature, however, repeatedly informs us that the moon is full of highly elevated inhabitants who are counted amongst the demigods. We are therefore always in doubt about what kind of moon adventure the modern scientists of this planet earth have undertaken."

Therefore P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja used to please them in all respects by his words, mentality, works and gentle behavior.",
        "purport": " As will be explained in the next verse, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja used to please all kinds of citizens by his extraordinary capacity to understand the mentality of others. Indeed, his dealings were so perfect that every one of the citizens was very much satisfied and lived in complete peace. The word acyut\u0101tmaka\u1e25 is significant in this verse, for Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu used to rule this planet as the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He knew that he was the representative of the Lord and that the Lord\u2019s creation must be protected intelligently. Atheists cannot understand the purpose behind the creation. Although this material world is condemned when it is compared to the spiritual world, there is still some purpose behind it. Modern scientists and philosophers cannot understand that purpose, nor do they believe in the existence of a creator. They try to establish everything by their so-called scientific research, but they do not center anything around the supreme creator. A devotee, however, can understand the purpose of creation, which is to give facilities to the individual living entities who want to lord it over material nature. The ruler of this planet should therefore know that all the inhabitants, especially human beings, have come to this material world for sense enjoyment. It is therefore the duty of the ruler to satisfy them in their sense enjoyment as well as to elevate them to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that they all can ultimately return home, back to Godhead. With this idea in mind, the king or government head should rule the world. In this way, everyone will be satisfied. How can this be accomplished? There are many examples like P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and the history of his regency on this planet is elaborately described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Even in this fallen age, if the rulers, governors and presidents take advantage of P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s example, there will certainly be a reign of peace and prosperity throughout the world."

Similarly, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja exacted taxes and gave such strong orders to the citizens and government that no one had the power to disobey him.

In self-control he was like the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. As far as his devotional service was concerned, he was a great follower of devotees who were attached to cow protection and the rendering of all service to the spiritual master and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. He was perfect in his shyness and in his gentle behavior, and when he engaged in some philanthropic activity, he worked as if he were working for his own personal self.",
        "purport": " When Lord Caitanya talked to S\u0101rvabhauma Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101c\u0101rya, the Lord honored him as the incarnation of B\u1e5bhaspati. B\u1e5bhaspati is the chief priest of the heavenly kingdom, and he is a follower of the philosophy known as brahma-v\u0101da, or M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da. B\u1e5bhaspati is also a great logician. It appears from this statement that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, although a great devotee constantly engaged in the loving service of the Lord, could defeat all kinds of impersonalists and M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs by his profound knowledge of Vedic scriptures. We should learn from Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu that a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or devotee, must not only be fixed in the service of the Lord, but, if required, must be prepared to argue with the impersonalist M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs with all logic and philosophy and defeat their contention that the Absolute Truth is impersonal. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ideal self-controller or brahmac\u0101r\u012b. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was elected to be president of the R\u0101jas\u016bya yaj\u00f1a performed by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva praised Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the greatest brahmac\u0101r\u012b. Because Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, he was quite fit to distinguish a brahmac\u0101r\u012b from a vyabhic\u0101r\u012b. Although P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a householder and father of five children, he was still considered to be most controlled. One who begets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious children for the benefit of humanity is actually a brahmac\u0101r\u012b. One who simply begets children like cats and dogs is not a proper father. The word brahmac\u0101r\u012b also refers to one who acts on the platform of Brahman, or devotional service. In the impersonal Brahman conception, there is no activity, yet when one performs activities in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is to be known as brahmac\u0101r\u012b. Thus P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was an ideal brahmac\u0101r\u012b and g\u1e5bhastha simultaneously. Vi\u1e63vaksen\u0101nuvarti\u1e63u refers to those devotees who are constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. Other devotees must follow in their footsteps. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura said, ei chaya gos\u0101\u00f1i y\u0101\u1e45ra, mu\u00f1i t\u0101\u1e45ra d\u0101sa: \u201cI am prepared to become the disciple of anyone who follows in the footsteps of the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs.\u201d Also, like all Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu was devoted to cow protection, spiritual masters and qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was also very humble, meek and gentle, and whenever he performed any philanthropic work or welfare activity for the general public, he would labor exactly as if he were tending to his own personal necessities. In other words, his philanthropic activities were not for the sake of show but were performed out of personal feeling and commitment. All philanthropic activities should be thus performed."
