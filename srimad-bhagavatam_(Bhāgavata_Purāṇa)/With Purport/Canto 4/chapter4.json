        "purport": " According to the Vedic conception of family life, the husband gives half his body to his wife, and the wife gives half of her body to her husband. In other words, a husband without a wife or a wife without a husband is incomplete. Vedic marital relationship existed between Lord \u015aiva and Sat\u012b, but sometimes, due to weakness, a woman becomes very much attracted by the members of her father\u2019s house, and this happened to Sat\u012b. In this verse it is specifically mentioned that she wanted to leave such a great husband as \u015aiva because of her womanly weakness. In other words, womanly weakness exists even in the relationship between husband and wife. Generally, separation between husband and wife is due to womanly behavior; divorce takes place due to womanly weakness. The best course for a woman is to abide by the orders of her husband. That makes family life very peaceful. Sometimes there may be misunderstandings between husband and wife, as found even in such an elevated family relationship as that of Sat\u012b and Lord \u015aiva, but a wife should not leave her husband\u2019s protection because of such a misunderstanding. If she does so, it is understood to be due to her womanly weakness."

        "translation": "She then reached her father\u2019s house, where the sacrifice was being performed, and entered the arena where everyone was chanting the Vedic hymns. The great sages, br\u0101hma\u1e47as and demigods were all assembled there, and there were many sacrificial animals, as well as pots made of clay, stone, gold, grass and skin, which were all requisite for the sacrifice.",
        "purport": " When learned sages and br\u0101hma\u1e47as assemble to chant Vedic mantras, some of them also engage in arguing about the conclusion of the scriptures. Thus some of the sages and br\u0101hma\u1e47as were arguing, and some of them were chanting the Vedic mantras, so the entire atmosphere was surcharged with transcendental sound vibration. This transcendental sound vibration has been simplified in the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. In this age, no one is expected to be highly educated in the Vedic ways of understanding because people are very slow, lazy and unfortunate. Therefore Lord Caitanya has recommended the sound vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.32) it is also recommended: yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25. At the present moment it is impossible to gather sacrificial necessities because of the poverty of the population and their lack of knowledge in Vedic mantras. Therefore for this age it is recommended that people gather together and chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is accompanied by His associates. Indirectly this indicates Lord Caitanya, who is accompanied by His associates Nity\u0101nanda, Advaita and others. That is the process of performing yaj\u00f1a in this age. Another significant point in this verse is that there were animals for sacrifice. That these animals were meant for sacrifice does not mean that they were meant to be killed. The great sages and realized souls assembled were performing yaj\u00f1as, and their realization was tested by animal sacrifice, just as, in modern science, tests are made on animals to determine the effectiveness of a particular medicine. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as entrusted with the performance of yaj\u00f1a were very realized souls, and to test their realization an old animal was offered in the fire and rejuvenated. That was the test of a Vedic mantra. The animals gathered were not meant to be killed and eaten. The real purpose of a sacrifice was not to replace a slaughterhouse but to test a Vedic mantra by giving an animal new life. Animals were used to test the power of Vedic mantras, not for meat."

To see her relatives, her sisters and mother, was not so important; even when she was received by her mother and sisters she did not care, for she was most concerned that her husband was being insulted in the sacrifice.

        "translation": "The followers of Lord \u015aiva, the ghosts, were ready to injure or kill Dak\u1e63a, but Sat\u012b stopped them by her order. She was very angry and sorrowful, and in that mood she began to condemn the process of sacrificial fruitive activities and persons who are very proud of such unnecessary and troublesome sacrifices. She especially condemned her father, speaking against him in the presence of all.",
        "purport": " The process of offering sacrifices is especially meant to satisfy Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is called Yaj\u00f1e\u015ba because He is the enjoyer of the fruits of all sacrifice. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29) also confirms this fact. The Lord says, bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101m: He is the actual beneficiary of all sacrifices. Not knowing this fact, less intelligent men offer sacrifices for some material benefit. To derive personal material benefits for sense gratification is the reason persons like Dak\u1e63a and his followers perform sacrifices. Such sacrifices are condemned here as a labor of love without actual profit. This is confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. One may prosecute the Vedic injunctions of offering sacrifices and other fruitive activities, but if by such activities one does not develop attraction for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, they are useless labors. One who has developed love for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u must develop love and respect for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s devotees. Lord \u015aiva is considered the foremost personality amongst the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas (vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 yath\u0101 \u015bambhu\u1e25). Thus when Sat\u012b saw that her father was performing great sacrifices but had no respect for the greatest devotee, Lord \u015aiva, she was very angry. This is fitting; when Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is insulted, one should be angry. Lord Caitanya, who always preached nonviolence, meekness and humility, also became angry when Nity\u0101nanda was offended by Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i, and He wanted to kill them. When Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is blasphemed or dishonored, one should be very angry. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura said, krodha bhakta-dve\u1e63i jane. We have anger, and that anger can be a great quality when directed against a person who is envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee. One should not be tolerant when a person is offensive towards Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. The anger of Sat\u012b towards her father was not objectionable, for although he was her father, he was trying to insult the greatest Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Thus Sat\u012b\u2019s anger against her father was quite applaudable."

Unfortunately, you have found fault with such a great soul.",
        "purport": " King Dak\u1e63a is addressed here by his daughter Sat\u012b as dvija, twice-born. \u201cTwice-born\u201d refers to the higher classes of men, namely the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas. In other words, a dvija is not an ordinary man but one who has studied the Vedic literature from a spiritual master and can discriminate between good and bad. Therefore it is supposed that he understands logic and philosophy. Sat\u012b, Dak\u1e63a\u2019s daughter, put before him sound arguments. There are some highly qualified persons who accept only the good qualities of others. Just as a bee is always interested in the honey in the flower and does not consider the thorns and colors, highly qualified persons, who are uncommon, accept only the good qualities of others, not considering their bad qualities, whereas the common man can judge what are good qualities and what are bad qualities. Among the uncommonly good souls there are still gradations, and the best good soul is one who accepts an insignificant asset of a person and magnifies that good quality. Lord \u015aiva is also called \u0100\u015buto\u1e63a, which refers to one who is satisfied very easily and who offers to any person the highest level of benediction. For example, once a devotee of Lord \u015aiva wanted the benediction that whenever he touched someone on the head, that person\u2019s head would at once be separated from his trunk. Lord \u015aiva agreed. Although the benediction asked was not very commendable because the devotee wanted to kill his enemy, Lord \u015aiva considered the devotee\u2019s good quality in worshiping and satisfying him and granted the benediction. Thus Lord \u015aiva accepted his bad qualities as magnificently good qualities. But Sat\u012b accused her father, \u201cYou are just the opposite. Although Lord \u015aiva has so many good qualities and no bad qualities at all, you have accepted him as bad and found fault with him. Because of your accepting his good qualities to be bad, instead of your becoming the most exalted soul you have become the most fallen. A man becomes the greatest soul by accepting the goodness of others\u2019 qualities, but by unnecessarily considering others\u2019 good qualities to be bad, you have become the lowest of the fallen souls.\u201d"

Similarly, mah\u012byas\u0101\u1e41 p\u0101da-rajo-\u2019bhi\u1e63ekam: the dust of the lotus feet of great personalities offers all good to the recipient, but the same dust can also do harm. Those who are offenders at the lotus feet of a great personality dry up; their godly qualities diminish. A great soul may forgive offenses, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not excuse offenses to the dust of that great soul\u2019s feet, just as one can tolerate the scorching sunshine on one\u2019s head but cannot tolerate the scorching sunshine on one\u2019s feet. An offender glides down more and more; therefore he naturally continues to commit offenses at the feet of the great soul. Offenses are generally committed by persons who falsely identify with the impermanent body. King Dak\u1e63a was deeply engrossed in a misconception because he identified the body with the soul. He offended the lotus feet of Lord \u015aiva because he thought that his body, being the father of the body of Sat\u012b, was superior to Lord \u015aiva\u2019s. Generally, less intelligent men misidentify in that way, and they act in the bodily concept of life. Thus they are subject to commit more and more offenses at the lotus feet of great souls. One who has such a concept of life is considered to be in the class of animals like cows and asses."

Within the body the soul is auspicious. Aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi: \u201cI am Brahman.\u201d This realization is auspicious. As long as one does not realize his identity as the soul, whatever he does is inauspicious. \u015aiva means \u201causpicious,\u201d and devotees of Lord \u015aiva gradually come to the platform of spiritual identification, but that is not all. Auspicious life begins from the point of spiritual identification. But there are still more duties \u2014 one has to understand one\u2019s relationship with the Supreme Soul. If one is actually a devotee of Lord \u015aiva, he comes to the platform of spiritual realization, but if he is not intelligent enough, then he stops at that point, only realizing that he is spirit soul (aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi). If he is intelligent enough, however, he should continue to act in the way of Lord \u015aiva, for Lord \u015aiva is always absorbed in the thought of V\u0101sudeva. As previously explained, sattva\u1e41 vi\u015buddha\u1e41 vasudeva-\u015babditam: Lord \u015aiva is always in meditation on the lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the auspicious position of Lord \u015aiva is realized if one takes to the worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, because Lord \u015aiva says in the \u015aiva Pur\u0101\u1e47a that the topmost worship is worship of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Lord \u015aiva is worshiped because he is the greatest devotee of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. One should not, however, make the mistake of considering Lord \u015aiva and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to be on the same level. That is also an atheistic idea. It is also enjoined in the Vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, is the exalted Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one should be compared to Him as equal, even Lord \u015aiva or Lord Brahm\u0101, not to speak of other demigods."

Next, those who are disgusted or frustrated with the materialistic way of life worship Lord \u015aiva to attain salvation, which entails freedom from material identification. One who understands that he is not the material body but is spirit soul is liberated from ignorance. Lord \u015aiva also offers that facility. People generally practice religion for economic development, to get some money, for by getting money they can satisfy their senses. But when they are frustrated they want spiritual brahm\u0101nanda, or merging into the Supreme. These four principles of material life \u2014 religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation \u2014 exist, and Lord \u015aiva is the friend of both the ordinary man and the man who is elevated in spiritual knowledge. Thus it was not good for Dak\u1e63a to create enmity towards him. Even Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, who are above both the ordinary and the elevated men in this world, also worship Lord \u015aiva as the greatest Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Thus he is the friend of everyone \u2014 the common men, the elevated men and the devotees of the Lord \u2014 so no one should disrespect or create enmity towards Lord \u015aiva."

He associates with the demons in the crematorium, his locks of hair are scattered all over his body, and he is garlanded with human skulls and smeared with ashes from the crematorium, but in spite of all these inauspicious qualities, great personalities like Brahm\u0101 honor him by accepting the flowers offered to his lotus feet and placing them with great respect on their heads.",
        "purport": " It is useless to condemn a great personality like Lord \u015aiva, and this is being stated by his wife, Sat\u012b, to establish the supremacy of her husband. First she said, \u201cYou call Lord \u015aiva inauspicious because he associates with demons in crematoriums, covers his body with the ashes of the dead, and garlands himself with the skulls of human beings. You have shown so many defects, but you do not know that his position is always transcendental. Although he appears inauspicious, why do personalities like Brahm\u0101 respect the dust of his lotus feet and place on their heads with great respect those very garlands which are condemned by you?\u201d Since Sat\u012b was a chaste woman and the wife of Lord \u015aiva, it was her duty to establish the elevated position of Lord \u015aiva, not only by sentiment but by facts. Lord \u015aiva is not an ordinary living entity. This is the conclusion of Vedic scripture. He is neither on the level of the Supreme Personality of Godhead nor on the level of the ordinary living entities. Brahm\u0101 is in almost all cases an ordinary living entity. Sometimes, when there is no ordinary living entity available, the post of Brahm\u0101 is occupied by an expansion of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but generally this post is occupied by a greatly pious living entity within this universe. Thus Lord \u015aiva\u2019s position is constitutionally higher than that of Lord Brahm\u0101, although Lord \u015aiva appeared as the son of Brahm\u0101. Here it is mentioned that even personalities like Brahm\u0101 accept the so-called inauspicious flowers and the dust of the lotus feet of Lord \u015aiva. Great sages like Mar\u012bci, Atri, Bh\u1e5bgu and the others among the nine great sages who are descendants of Brahm\u0101 also respect Lord \u015aiva in such a way because they all know that Lord \u015aiva is not an ordinary living entity. In many Pur\u0101\u1e47as it is sometimes asserted that a demigod is elevated to such a high position that he is almost on an equal level with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the conclusion that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Supreme Personality of Godhead is confirmed in every scripture. Lord \u015aiva is described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 to be like curd or yogurt. Curd is not different from milk. Since milk is transformed into curd, in one sense curd is also milk. Similarly, Lord \u015aiva is in one sense the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but in another sense he is not, just as curd is milk although we have to distinguish between the two. These descriptions are in the Vedic literature. Whenever we find that a demigod occupies a position apparently more elevated than that of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is just to draw the devotee\u2019s attention to that particular demigod. It is also stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25) that if one wants to worship a particular demigod, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is sitting in everyone\u2019s heart, gives one greater and greater attachment for that demigod so that one may be elevated to the demigod\u2019s abode. Y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n: by worshiping demigods one can elevate himself to the abodes of the demigods; similarly, by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead one can be elevated to the spiritual kingdom. This is stated in different places in Vedic literature. Here Lord \u015aiva is praised by Sat\u012b, partially due to her personal respect for Lord \u015aiva, since he is her husband, and partially due to his exalted position, which exceeds that of ordinary living entities, even Lord Brahm\u0101. The position of Lord \u015aiva is accepted by Lord Brahm\u0101, so Dak\u1e63a, Sat\u012b\u2019s father, should also recognize him. That was the point of Sat\u012b\u2019s statement. She did not actually come to her father\u2019s house to participate in the function, although before coming she pleaded with her husband that she wanted to see her sisters and her mother. That was a plea only, for actually at heart she maintained the idea that she would convince her father, Dak\u1e63a, that it was useless to continue being envious of Lord \u015aiva. That was her main purpose. When she was unable to convince her father, she gave up the body he had given her, as will be seen in the following verses."

        "translation": "Sat\u012b continued: If one hears an irresponsible person blaspheme the master and controller of religion, one should block his ears and go away if unable to punish him. But if one is able to kill, then one should by force cut out the blasphemer\u2019s tongue and kill the offender, and after that one should give up his own life.",
        "purport": " The argument offered by Sat\u012b is that a person who vilifies a great personality is the lowest of all creatures. But, by the same argument, Dak\u1e63a could also defend himself by saying that since he was a Praj\u0101pati, the master of many living creatures and one of the great officers of the great universal affairs, his position was so exalted that Sat\u012b should accept his good qualities instead of vilifying him. The answer to that argument is that Sat\u012b was not vilifying but defending. If possible she should have cut out Dak\u1e63a\u2019s tongue because he blasphemed Lord \u015aiva. In other words, since Lord \u015aiva is the protector of religion, a person who vilifies him should be killed at once, and after killing such a person, one should give up one\u2019s life. That is the process, but because Dak\u1e63a happened to be the father of Sat\u012b, she decided not to kill him but to give up her own life in order to compensate for the great sin she had committed by hearing blasphemy of Lord \u015aiva. The instruction set forth here in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is that one should not tolerate at any cost the activities of a person who vilifies or blasphemes an authority. If one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a he should not give up his body because by doing so he would be responsible for killing a br\u0101hma\u1e47a; therefore a br\u0101hma\u1e47a should leave the place or block his ears so that he will not hear the blasphemy. If one happens to be a k\u1e63atriya he has the power to punish any man; therefore a k\u1e63atriya should at once cut out the tongue of the vilifier and kill him. But as far as the vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras are concerned, they should immediately give up their bodies. Sat\u012b decided to give up her body because she thought herself to be among the \u015b\u016bdras and vai\u015byas. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.32), striyo vai\u015by\u0101s tath\u0101 \u015b\u016bdr\u0101\u1e25. Women, laborers and the mercantile class are on the same level. Thus since it is recommended that vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras should immediately give up their bodies upon hearing blasphemy of an exalted person like Lord \u015aiva, she decided to give up her life."

A common man must observe all the rules and regulations of the Vedas, which a person who is in the transcendental position does not need to observe. Dak\u1e63a found fault with Lord \u015aiva for not observing all the strict rules and regulations of the Vedas, but Sat\u012b asserted that he had no need to observe such rules.

In consideration of these two kinds of activities, there are two kinds of people, who have different symptoms. If one wants to see two kinds of activities in one person, that is contradictory. But both kinds of activities may be neglected by a person who is transcendentally situated.",
        "purport": " The Vedic activities are so designed that the conditioned soul who has come to enjoy the material world may do so under direction so that at the end he becomes detached from such material enjoyment and is eligible to enter into the transcendental position. The four different social orders \u2014 brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa \u2014 gradually train a person to come to the platform of transcendental life. The activities and dress of a g\u1e5bhastha, or householder, are different from those of a sanny\u0101s\u012b, one in the renounced order of life. It is impossible for one person to adopt both orders. A sanny\u0101s\u012b cannot act like a householder, nor can a householder act like a sanny\u0101s\u012b, but above these two kinds of persons \u2014 one who engages in material activities and one who has renounced material activities \u2014 there is the person who is transcendental to both. Lord \u015aiva is in the transcendental position because, as stated before, he is always absorbed in the thought of Lord V\u0101sudeva within himself. Therefore neither the activities of the g\u1e5bhastha nor those of the sanny\u0101s\u012b in the renounced order can be applicable for him. He is in the paramaha\u1e41sa stage, the highest perfectional stage of life. The transcendental position of Lord \u015aiva is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.52-53). It is stated there that when one fully engages in the transcendental service of the Lord by performing activities without fruitive results, one is elevated to the transcendental position. At that time he has no obligation to follow the Vedic injunctions or the different rules and regulations of the Vedas. When one is above the directions of the Vedic ritualistic injunctions for attaining different allurements and is fully absorbed in transcendental thought, which means thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service, one is in the position called buddhi-yoga, or sam\u0101dhi, ecstasy. For a person who has attained this stage, neither the Vedic activities for realizing material enjoyment nor those for renunciation are applicable."

        "translation": "My dear father, the opulence we possess is impossible for either you or your flatterers to imagine, for persons who engage in fruitive activities by performing great sacrifices are concerned with satisfying their bodily necessities by eating foodstuff offered as a sacrifice. We can exhibit our opulences simply by desiring to do so. This can be achieved only by great personalities who are renounced, self-realized souls.",
        "purport": " Sat\u012b\u2019s father was under the impression that he was exalted in both prestige and opulence and that he had offered his daughter to a person who was not only poor but devoid of all culture. Her father might have been thinking that although she was a chaste woman, greatly adherent to her husband, her husband was in a deplorable condition. To counteract such thoughts, Sat\u012b said that the opulence possessed by her husband could not be understood by materialistic persons like Dak\u1e63a and his followers, who were flatterers and were engaged in fruitive activities. Her husband\u2019s position was different. He possessed all opulences, but he did not like to exhibit them. Therefore such opulences are called avyakta, or unmanifested. But if required, simply by willing, Lord \u015aiva can show his wonderful opulences, and such an event is predicted here, for it would soon occur. The opulence Lord \u015aiva possesses is enjoyable in renunciation and love of God, not in material exhibition of sense gratificatory methods. Such opulences are possessed by personalities like the Kum\u0101ras, N\u0101rada and Lord \u015aiva, not by others. In this verse the performers of the Vedic rituals are condemned. They have been described here as dh\u016bma-vartmabhi\u1e25, those who maintain themselves on the remnants of sacrificial foodstuff. There are two kinds of foodstuff offered in sacrifice. One kind is food offered in fruitive ritualistic sacrifices, and the other, the best, is food offered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Although in all cases Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the chief Deity on the sacrificial altar, the performers of fruitive rituals aim to satisfy various demigods to achieve in return some material prosperity. Real sacrifice, however, is to satisfy Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and the remnants of such sacrifices are beneficial for advancement in devotional service. The process of elevation by performing sacrifices other than those aimed at Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is very slow, and therefore it has been condemned in this verse. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b has described the ritualistic performers to be like crows because crows delight in eating the remnants of food which has been thrown into the dustbin. All the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who were present for the sacrifice were also condemned by Sat\u012b. Whether or not King Dak\u1e63a and his flatterers could understand the position of Lord \u015aiva, Sat\u012b wanted to impress upon her father that he should not think her husband to be without opulence. Sat\u012b, being the devoted wife of Lord \u015aiva, offers all kinds of material opulences to the worshipers of Lord \u015aiva. This fact is explained in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, in the Tenth Canto. Lord \u015aiva\u2019s worshipers sometimes appear more opulent than the worshipers of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u because Durg\u0101, or Sat\u012b, being the superintendent in charge of material affairs, can offer all material opulences to the worshipers of Lord \u015aiva in order to glorify her husband, whereas the worshipers of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are meant for spiritual elevation, and therefore their material opulence is sometimes found to decrease. These points are very nicely discussed in the Tenth Canto."

        "purport": " It is said that when a man desires to quit his body he dresses in saffron garments. Therefore it appears that Sat\u012b changed her dress, indicating that she was going to quit the body given her by Dak\u1e63a. Dak\u1e63a was Sat\u012b\u2019s father, so instead of killing Dak\u1e63a she decided that it would be better to destroy the part of his body which was hers. Thus she decided to give up the body of Dak\u1e63a by the yogic process. Sat\u012b was the wife of Lord \u015aiva, who is known as Yoge\u015bvara, the best among all yog\u012bs, because he knows all the mystic processes of yoga, so it appeared that Sat\u012b also knew them. Either she learned yoga from her husband or she was enlightened because she was the daughter of such a great king as Dak\u1e63a. The perfection of yoga is that one can give up one\u2019s body or release oneself from the embodiment of material elements according to one\u2019s desire. Yog\u012bs who have attained perfection are not subject to death by natural laws; such perfect yog\u012bs can leave the body whenever they desire. Generally the yog\u012b first of all becomes mature in controlling the air passing within the body, thus bringing the soul to the top of the brain. Then when the body bursts into flames, the yog\u012b can go anywhere he likes. This yoga system recognizes the soul, and thus it is distinct from the so-called yoga process for controlling the cells of the body, which has been discovered in the modern age. The real yoga process accepts the transmigration of the soul from one planet to another or one body to another; and it appears from this incident that Sat\u012b wanted to transfer her soul to another body or sphere."

Then she raised her life air, mixed with intelligence, to the heart and then gradually towards the pulmonary passage, and from there to between her eyebrows.",
        "purport": " The yogic process is to control the air passing within the body in different places called \u1e63a\u1e6d-cakra, the six circles of air circulation. The air is raised from the abdomen to the navel, from the navel to the heart, from the heart to the throat, from the throat to between the eyebrows and from between the eyebrows to the top of the cerebrum. That is the sum and substance of practicing yoga. Before practicing the real yoga system, one has to practice the sitting postures because this helps in the breathing exercises which control the airs going upwards and downwards. This is a great technique which one has to practice to attain the highest perfectional stage of yoga, but such practice is not meant for this age. No one in this age can attain the perfectional stage of such yoga, but people indulge in practicing sitting postures, which is more or less a gymnastic process. By such bodily gymnastics one may develop good circulation and may therefore keep one\u2019s body fit, but if one simply restricts oneself to that gymnastic process one cannot attain the highest perfectional stage. The yoga process, as described in the Ke\u015bava-\u015bruti, prescribes how one can control his living force according to his desire and transmigrate from one body to another or from one place to another. In other words, yoga practice is not meant to keep the body fit. Any transcendental process of spiritual realization automatically helps one to keep the body fit, for it is the spirit soul that keeps the body always fresh. As soon as the spirit soul is out of the body, the material body immediately begins to decompose. Any spiritual process keeps the body fit without separate endeavor, but if one takes it that the ultimate aim of yoga is to maintain the body, then he is mistaken. The real perfection of yoga is elevation of the soul to a higher position or the liberation of the soul from material entanglement. Some yog\u012bs try to elevate the soul to higher planetary systems, where the standard of life is different from that of this planet and where the material comforts, life span and other facilities for self-realization are greater, and some yog\u012bs endeavor to elevate the soul to the spiritual world, the spiritual Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. The bhakti-yoga process directly elevates the soul to the spiritual planets, where life is eternally blissful and full of knowledge; therefore bhakti-yoga is considered to be the greatest of all yoga systems."

        "purport": " Lord \u015aiva is described herein as the best of all great souls. Although Sat\u012b\u2019s body was born of Dak\u1e63a, Lord \u015aiva used to adore her by sitting her on his lap. This is considered a great token of respect. Thus Sat\u012b\u2019s body was not ordinary, but still she decided to give it up because it was the source of unhappiness because of its connection with Dak\u1e63a. This severe example set by Sat\u012b is to be followed. One should be extremely careful about associating with persons who are not respectful to the higher authorities. It is therefore instructed in the Vedic literature that one should always be free from the association of atheists and nondevotees and should try to associate with devotees, for by the association of a devotee one can be elevated to the platform of self-realization. This injunction is stressed in many places in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam; if one wants to be liberated from the clutches of material existence, then one has to associate with great souls, and if one wants to continue one\u2019s material existential life, then one may associate with persons who are materialistic. The materialistic way of life is based on sex life. Thus both becoming addicted to sex life and associating with persons who are addicted to sex life are condemned in the Vedic literature because such association will simply interfere with one\u2019s spiritual progress. However, association with great personalities, devotees who are great souls, will elevate one to the spiritual platform. Sat\u012bdev\u012b decided to quit the body she had obtained from Dak\u1e63a\u2019s body, and she wanted to transfer herself to another body so that she might have completely uncontaminated association with Lord \u015aiva. Of course, it is understood that in her next life she would take birth as the daughter of the Him\u0101layas, P\u0101rvat\u012b, and then she would again accept Lord \u015aiva as her husband. Sat\u012b and Lord \u015aiva are eternally related; even after she changes her body, their relationship is never broken."

Thus she became completely cleansed of all taints of sin and quit her body in a blazing fire by meditation on the fiery elements.",
        "purport": " Sat\u012b at once thought of the lotus feet of her husband, Lord \u015aiva, who is one of the three great personalities of Godhead in charge of the management of the material world, and simply by meditating on his lotus feet she derived such great pleasure that she forgot everything in relationship with her body. This pleasure was certainly material because she gave up her body for another body that was also material, but by this example we can appreciate the devotee\u2019s pleasure in concentrating his mind and attention on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There is such transcendental bliss in simply meditating on the lotus feet of the Lord that one can forget everything but the Lord\u2019s transcendental form. This is the perfection of yogic sam\u0101dhi, or ecstasy. In this verse it is stated that by such meditation she became free from all contamination. What was that contamination? The contamination was her concept of the body derived from Dak\u1e63a, but she forgot that bodily relationship in trance. The purport is that when one becomes free from all bodily relationships within this material world and simply places himself in the position of an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord, it is to be understood that all the contamination of his material attachment has been burned by the blazing fires of transcendental ecstasy. It is not necessary for one to manifest a blazing fire externally, for if one forgets all his bodily relationships within this material world and becomes situated in his spiritual identity, it is said that one has been freed from all material contamination by the blazing fire of yogic sam\u0101dhi, or ecstasy. That is the topmost perfection of yoga. If one keeps his bodily relationships within this material world and poses himself as a great yog\u012b, he is not a bona fide yog\u012b. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.4.15) it is stated, yat-k\u012brtana\u1e41 yat-smara\u1e47a\u1e41. Simply by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, simply by remembering the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, simply by offering prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is immediately freed from material contamination, the material bodily concept, by the blazing fire of ecstasy. This effect takes place immediately, without a second\u2019s delay. According to \u015ar\u012b J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, that Sat\u012b quit her body means that she gave up within her heart her relationship with Dak\u1e63a. \u015ar\u012b Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also comments that since Sat\u012b is the superintendent deity of the external potency, when she quit her body she did not get a spiritual body but simply transferred from the body she had received from Dak\u1e63a. Other commentators also say that she immediately transferred herself into the womb of Menak\u0101, her future mother. She gave up the body she had received from Dak\u1e63a and immediately transferred herself to another, better body, but this does not mean that she got a spiritual body."

        "purport": " There was a tumultuous roaring all over the universe in the societies of the demigods of different planets because Sat\u012b was the daughter of Dak\u1e63a, the greatest of all kings, and the wife of Lord \u015aiva, the greatest of all demigods. Why did she become so angry that she gave up her body? Since she was the daughter of a great personality and wife of a great personality, she had nothing to desire, but still she gave up her body in dissatisfaction. Certainly this was astonishing. One cannot attain complete satisfaction even if one is situated in the greatest material opulence. There was nothing Sat\u012b could not achieve either from her relationship with her father or from her relationship with the greatest of the demigods, but still, for some reason, she was dissatisfied. Therefore \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.6) explains that one has to achieve real satisfaction (yay\u0101tm\u0101 supras\u012bdati), but \u0101tm\u0101 \u2014 the body, mind and soul \u2014 all become completely satisfied only if one develops devotional service to the Absolute Truth (sa vai pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41 paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok\u1e63aje). Adhok\u1e63aja means the Absolute Truth. If one can develop his unflinching love for the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead, that can give complete satisfaction; otherwise there is no possibility of satisfaction in the material world or anywhere else."

        "purport": " Dak\u1e63a is described here as most hardhearted and therefore unqualified to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Brahma-dhruk is described by some commentators to mean brahma-bandhu, or friend of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. A person who is born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family but has no brahminical qualifications is called a brahma-bandhu. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as are generally very softhearted and forbearing because they have the power to control the senses and the mind. Dak\u1e63a, however, was not forbearing. For the simple reason that his son-in-law, Lord \u015aiva, did not stand up to show him the formality of respect, he became so angry and hardhearted that he tolerated even the death of his dearest daughter. Sat\u012b tried her best to mitigate the misunderstanding between the son-in-law and the father-in-law by coming to her father\u2019s house, even without an invitation, and at that time Dak\u1e63a should have received her, forgetting all past misunderstandings. But he was so hardhearted that he was unworthy to be called an \u0100ryan or br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Thus his ill fame still continues. Dak\u1e63a means \u201cexpert,\u201d and he was given this name because of his ability to beget many hundreds and thousands of children. Persons who are too sexually inclined and materialistic become so hardhearted because of a slight loss of prestige that they can tolerate even the death of their children."

        "translation": "When the \u1e5abhu demigods attacked the ghosts and Guhyakas with half-burned fuel from the yaj\u00f1a fire, all these attendants of Sat\u012b fled in different directions and disappeared. This was possible simply because of brahma-tejas, brahminical power.",
        "purport": " The word brahma-tejas\u0101, used in this verse, is significant. In those days, br\u0101hma\u1e47as were so powerful that simply by desiring and by chanting a Vedic mantra, they could accomplish very wonderful effects. But in the present age of degradation there are no such br\u0101hma\u1e47as. According to the P\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika system, in this age the entire population is supposed to consist of \u015b\u016bdras because the brahminical culture has been lost. But if anyone displays the signs of understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he should be accepted, according to Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sm\u1e5bti regulations, as a prospective br\u0101hma\u1e47a and should be given all facilities to achieve the highest perfection. The most magnanimous gift of Lord Caitanya\u2019s is that the highest perfection of life is available in this fallen age if one simply adopts the process of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is able to bring about the fulfillment of all activities in self-realization."
