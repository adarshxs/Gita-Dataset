        "translation": "Once the dangerous soldiers attacked the city of Pura\u00f1jana with great force. Although the city was full of paraphernalia for sense gratification, it was being protected by the old serpent.",
        "purport": " As one\u2019s body engages in sense gratification, it becomes weaker and weaker daily. Finally the vital force becomes so weak that it is herein compared to a weak serpent. The life air has already been compared to the serpent. When the vital force within the body becomes weak, the body itself also becomes weak. At such a time the death symptoms \u2014 that is, the dangerous soldiers of death\u2019s superintendent, Yamar\u0101ja \u2014 begin to attack very severely. According to the Vedic system, before coming to such a stage one should leave home and take sanny\u0101sa to preach the message of God for the duration of life. However, if one sits at home and is served by his beloved wife and children, he certainly becomes weaker and weaker due to sense gratification. When death finally comes, one leaves the body devoid of spiritual assets. At the present time, even the oldest man in the family does not leave home, being attracted by wife, children, money, opulence, dwelling, etc. Thus at the end of life one worries about how his wife will be protected and how she will manage the great family responsibilities. In this way a man usually thinks of his wife before death. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.6): \u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.\u201d At the end of life, a person thinks of what he has done throughout his whole life; thus he gets another body (deh\u0101ntara) according to his thoughts and desires at the end of life. One overly addicted to life at home naturally thinks of his beloved wife at the end of life. Consequently, in the next life he gets the body of a woman, and he also acquires the results of his pious or impious activities. In this chapter the acceptance of a woman\u2019s body by King Pura\u00f1jana will be thoroughly explained."

        "purport": " At the fag end of life, when the invalidity of old age attacks a man, his body becomes useless for all purposes. Therefore Vedic training dictates that when a man is in his boyhood he should be trained in the process of brahmacarya \u2014 that is, he should be completely engaged in the service of the Lord and should not in any way associate with women. When the boy becomes a young man, he marries between the ages of twenty and twenty-five. When he is married at the right age, he can immediately beget strong, healthy sons. Now female descendants are increasing because young men are very weak sexually. A male child will be born if the husband is sexually stronger than the wife, but if the female is stronger, a female child will be born. Thus it is essential to practice the system of brahmacarya if one wishes to beget a male child when one is married. When one reaches the age of fifty, he should give up family life. At that time one\u2019s child should be grown up so that the father can leave the family responsibilities to him. The husband and wife may then go abroad to live a retired life and travel to different places of pilgrimage. When both the husband and wife lose their attachment for family and home, the wife returns home to live under the care of her grown-up children and to remain aloof from family affairs. The husband then takes sanny\u0101sa to render some service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the perfect system of civilization. The human form of life is especially meant for God realization. If one is unable to take to the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness from the very beginning of life, he must be trained to accept these principles at the fag end of life. Unfortunately, there is no training even in childhood, nor can one give up his family life even at the end. This is the situation with the city of Pura\u00f1jana, figuratively described in these verses."

The nostrils are blocked by mucus, and one has to always sniff a medicinal bottle containing ammonia. Similarly, the mouth, too weak to chew, requires false teeth. The rectum also gives one trouble, and the evacuation process becomes difficult. Sometimes one has to take enemas and sometimes use a surgical nozzle to accelerate the passing of urine. In this way the city of Pura\u00f1jana was attacked at various gates by the soldiers.

        "purport": " When one becomes an invalid, his senses and organs are weakened. In other words, they are no longer under one\u2019s control. The senses and sense objects then begin to oppose him. When a person is in a distressed condition, even his family members \u2014 his sons, grandsons and wife \u2014 become disrespectful. They no longer are under the command of the master of the house. Just as we wish to use our senses for sense gratification, the senses also require strength from the body in reciprocation. A man keeps a family for enjoyment, and similarly family members demand enjoyment from the head of the family. When they do not receive sufficient money from him, they grow disinterested and ignore his commands or desires. This is all due to one\u2019s being a k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a (miser). This word k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a, used in the sixth verse, is in opposition to the word br\u0101hma\u1e47a. In the human form of life one should become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, which means that one should understand the constitutional position of the Absolute Truth, Brahman, and then engage in His service as a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. We get this facility in the human form of life, but if we do not properly utilize this opportunity, we become a k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a, miser. A miser is one who gets money but does not spend it properly. This human form of life is especially meant for understanding Brahman, for becoming a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and if we do not utilize it properly, we remain a k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a. We can actually see that when one has money but does not spend it, he remains a miser and is never happy. Similarly, when one\u2019s intelligence is spoiled due to sense gratification, he remains a miser throughout his life."

        "translation": "The city of King Pura\u00f1jana was overcome by the Gandharva and Yavana soldiers, and although the King had no desire to leave the city, he was circumstantially forced to do so, for it was smashed by K\u0101lakany\u0101.",
        "purport": " The living entity, separated from the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, tries to enjoy this material world. He is given a chance to enjoy it in a particular type of body, beginning with the body of a Brahm\u0101 down to that of the microbe. From the Vedic history of creation we can understand that the first living creature was Lord Brahm\u0101, who created the seven great sages and other Praj\u0101patis to increase the universal population. Thus every living entity, according to karma, his past desires and activities, gets a particular type of body, from that of Brahm\u0101 to that of a microbe or germ in stool. Due to long association with a particular type of material body and also due to the grace of K\u0101lakany\u0101 and her m\u0101y\u0101, one becomes overly attached to a material body, although it is the abode of pain. Even if one tries to separate a worm from stool, the worm will be unwilling to leave. It will return to the stool. Similarly, a hog generally lives in a very filthy state, eating stool, but if one tries to separate it from its condition and give it a nice place, the hog will be unwilling. In this way if we study each and every living entity, we will find that he will defy offers of a more comfortable position. Although King Pura\u00f1jana was attacked from all sides, he was unwilling to leave the city. In other words, the living entity \u2014 whatever his condition \u2014 does not want to give up the body. But he will be forced to give it up because, after all, this material body cannot exist forever. The living entity wishes to enjoy the material world in different ways, and therefore by nature\u2019s law he is allowed to transmigrate from one body to another, exactly as a person transmigrates from the body of an infant to a child to a boy to a youth to a man. This process is constantly going on. At the last stage, when the gross body becomes old and invalid, the living entity is reluctant to give it up, despite the fact that it is no longer usable. Although material existence and the material body are not comfortable, why does the living entity not want to leave? As soon as one gets a material body, he has to work very hard to maintain it. He may engage in different fields of activity, but whatever the case, everyone has to work very hard to maintain the material body. Unfortunately, society has no information of the soul\u2019s transmigration. Because the living entity does not hope to enter the spiritual kingdom of eternal life, bliss and knowledge, he wants to stick to his present body, even though it may be useless. Consequently, the greatest welfare activity in this material world is the furthering of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. This movement is giving human society information about the kingdom of God. There is God, there is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and everyone can return to God and live eternally in bliss and knowledge. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is not afraid of giving up the body because his position is always eternal. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord eternally; therefore as long as he lives within the body, he is happy to engage in the loving service of the Lord, and when he gives up the body, he is also permanently situated in the service of the Lord. The saintly devotees are always free and liberated, whereas the karm\u012bs, who have no knowledge of spiritual life or the transcendental loving service of the Lord, are very much afraid of giving up the rotten material body."

        "purport": " There are many parts of the body \u2014 the senses, the limbs, the skin, the muscles, blood, marrow, etc. \u2014 and all these are considered here figuratively as sons, grandsons, citizens and dependents. When the body is attacked by the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-jv\u0101ra, the fiery condition becomes so acute that sometimes one remains in a coma. This means that the body is in such severe pain that one becomes unconscious and cannot feel the miseries taking place within the body. Indeed, the living entity becomes so helpless at the time of death that, although unwilling, he is forced to give up the body and enter another. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated that man may, by scientific advancement, improve the temporary living conditions, but that he cannot avoid the pangs of birth, old age, disease and death. These are under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the agency of material nature. A foolish person cannot understand this simple fact. Now people are very busy trying to find petroleum in the midst of the ocean. They are very anxious to make provisions for the future petroleum supply, but they do not make any attempts to ameliorate the conditions of birth, old age, disease and death. Thus a person in ignorance, not knowing anything about his own future life, is certainly defeated in all his activities."

This indicates that the living entity, the soul, is carried by the subtle body \u2014 mind, intelligence and ego. Due to false ego, the living entity still wants to enjoy the material world, and for want of material enjoyment he becomes sorry or sad. He still makes intellectual plans to further his existence, and therefore, although he gives up the gross body, he is carried by the subtle body to another gross body. The transmigration of the subtle body is never visible to material eyes; therefore when one gives up the gross body, we think that he is finished. Plans for material enjoyment are made by the subtle body, and the gross body is the instrument for enjoying these plans. Thus the gross body can be compared to the wife, for the wife is the agent for all kinds of sense gratification. Because of long association with the gross body, the living entity becomes very sad to be separated from it. The mental activity of the living entity obliges him to accept another gross body and continue his material existence. The Sanskrit word str\u012b means \u201cexpansion.\u201d Through the wife one expands his various objects of attraction \u2014 sons, daughters, grandsons and so on. Attachment to family members becomes very prominent at the time of death.

Please take charge of the family affairs.\u201d He speaks in this way, not even knowing his destination."

For family life it is very good for a husband to be attached to his wife, but it is not very good for spiritual advancement. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness must be established in every home. If a husband and wife are very much attached to one another in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, they will both benefit because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the center of their existence. Otherwise, if the husband is too much attached to his wife, he becomes a woman in his next life. The woman, being overly attached to her husband, becomes a man in her next life. Of course, it is an advantage for a woman to become a man, but it is not at all advantageous for the man to become a woman."

Although she was the mother of so many sons and heroes, the King still feared that she would not be able to maintain the responsibility of household affairs.",
        "purport": " At the time of death King Pura\u00f1jana was thinking of his wife, and this is called polluted consciousness. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7): \u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\u201d The living entity is, after all, part and parcel of the Supreme Spirit, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s constitutional position and the living entity\u2019s constitutional position are the same qualitatively. The only difference is that the living entity is eternally an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25). In this material world of conditional life, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord, the individual soul, is struggling due to his contaminated mind and consciousness. As part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, a living entity is supposed to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but here we see that King Pura\u00f1jana (the living entity) is thinking of a woman. Such mental absorption with some sense object brings about the living entity\u2019s struggle for existence in this material world. Since King Pura\u00f1jana is thinking of his wife, his struggle for existence in the material world will not be ended by death. As revealed in the following verses, King Pura\u00f1jana had to accept the body of a woman in his next life due to his being overly absorbed in thoughts of his wife. Thus mental absorption in social, political, pseudoreligious, national and communal consciousness is cause for bondage. During one\u2019s lifetime one has to change his activities in order to attain release from bondage. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9): yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25. If we do not change our consciousness in this life, whatever we do in the name of social, political, religious or communal and national welfare will be the cause of our bondage. This means we have to continue in material, conditional life. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7), mana\u1e25-\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u012bndriy\u0101\u1e47i prak\u1e5bti-sth\u0101ni kar\u1e63ati: when the mind and senses are engaged in material activities, one has to continue his material existence and struggle to attain happiness. In each and every life one is engaged in the struggle to become happy. Actually no one in this material world is happy, but the struggle gives a false sense of happiness. A person must work very hard, and when he attains the result of his hard work, he thinks himself happy. In the material world people do not know what real happiness is. Sukham \u0101tyantika\u1e41 yat tad buddhi-gr\u0101hyam at\u012bndriyam (Bg. 6.21): real happiness must be appreciated by one\u2019s transcendental senses. Unless one is purified, the transcendental senses are not manifest; therefore to purify the senses one must take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engage the senses in the service of the Lord. Then there will be real happiness and liberation. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.8): \u201cThe living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another as the air carries aromas.\u201d If the wind passes over a garden of roses, it will carry the aroma of roses, and if it passes over a filthy place, it will carry the stench of obnoxious things. Similarly, King Pura\u00f1jana, the living entity, now passes the air of his life over his wife, a woman; therefore he has to accept the body of a woman in his next life."

One\u2019s next life will also be affected by the acts one performs during this life. Sometimes politicians act most sinfully for their own sense gratification. It is not unusual for a politician to kill the opposing party. Even though a politician may be allowed to take birth in his so-called homeland, he still has to undergo suffering due to his sinful activities in his previous life. This science of transmigration is completely unknown to modern scientists. So-called scientists do not like to bother with these things because if they would at all consider this subtle subject matter and the problems of life, they would see that their future is very dark.

        "purport": " Foolish people do not know that every individual soul is responsible for his own actions and reactions in life. As long as a living entity in the form of a child or boy is innocent, it is the duty of the father and mother to lead him into a proper understanding of the values of life. When a child is grown, it should be left up to him to execute the duties of life properly. The parent, after his death, cannot help his child. A father may leave some estate for his children\u2019s immediate help, but he should not be overly absorbed in thoughts of how his family will survive after his death. This is the disease of the conditioned soul. Not only does he commit sinful activities for his own sense gratification, but he accumulates great wealth to leave behind so that his children may also gorgeously arrange for sense gratification. In any case, everyone is afraid of death, and therefore death is called bhaya, or fear. Although King Pura\u00f1jana was engaged in thinking of his wife and children, death did not wait for him. Death does not wait for any man; it will immediately carry out its duty. Since death must take away the living entity without hesitation, it is the ultimate God realization of the atheists, who spoil their lives thinking of country, society and relatives, to the neglect of God consciousness. In this verse the word atad-arha\u1e47am is very significant, for it means that one should not be overly engaged in welfare activities for one\u2019s family members, countrymen, society and community. None of these will help a person to advance spiritually. Unfortunately, in present-day society so-called educated men have no idea what spiritual progress is. Although they have the opportunity in the human form of life to make spiritual progress, they remain misers. They use their lives improperly and simply waste them thinking about the material welfare of their relatives, countrymen, society and so on. One\u2019s actual duty is to learn how to conquer death. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states the process of conquering death in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d After giving up this body, one who is fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious does not accept another material body but returns home, back to Godhead. Everyone should try to attain this perfection. Unfortunately, instead of doing so, people are absorbed in thoughts of society, friendship, love and relatives. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, however, is educating people throughout the world and informing them how to conquer death. Hari\u1e41 vin\u0101 na m\u1e5bti\u1e41 taranti: one cannot conquer death without taking shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " When the living entity is arrested, all his followers \u2014 namely the life air, the senses and sense objects \u2014 immediately leave the lump of matter, the body. When the living entity and his companions leave, the body no longer works but turns into basic material elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air and ether. When a city attacked by enemies is vacated by its inhabitants, the enemy immediately takes advantage of that city and bombards it to smash the whole thing to dust. When we say, \u201cDust thou art, and unto dust thou shall return,\u201d we refer to the body. When a city is attacked and bombarded by enemies, the citizens generally leave, and the city ceases to exist. It is a foolish person who engages in improving the condition of a city without caring for the citizens or inhabitants. Similarly, a living entity who is not properly enlightened in spiritual knowledge simply takes care of the external body, not knowing that the spirit soul is the principal factor within the body. When one is advanced in spiritual knowledge, the spirit soul is saved from eternal transmigration. The Bh\u0101gavatam considers those who are attached to their bodies to be like cows and asses (sa eva go-khara\u1e25). The cow is a very innocent animal, and the ass is a beast of burden. One who labors under the bodily conception simply works like an ass and does not know his self-interest. It is therefore said: \u201cA human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his self, who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the land of birth worshipable, and who goes to a place of pilgrimage simply to take a bath rather than meet men of transcendental knowledge there, is to be considered like an ass or a cow.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.84.13) Human civilization devoid of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is simply a civilization of lower animals. Sometimes such a civilization may study the dead body and consider the brain or the heart. However, no part of the body is important unless the spirit soul is present. In a modern civilization of cows and asses, scientists try to search out some value in the brain or heart of a dead man."

If one does not know this and functions instead under the bodily conception, he is always harassed by the tribulations offered by material nature. In actuality, the Supreme Lord is sitting by the side of everyone: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be\u00a0\u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati (Bg. 18.61). The living entity and the Supersoul are sitting side by side in the same tree, but despite being harassed by the laws of material nature, the foolish living entity does not turn toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead for protection. However, he thinks that he is able to protect himself from the stringent laws of material nature. This, however, is not possible. The living entity must turn toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him. Only then will he be saved from the onslaught of the powerful Yavana, or Yamar\u0101ja. The word sakh\u0101yam, \u201cfriend,\u201d is very significant in this verse because God is eternally present beside the living entity. The Supreme Lord is also described as su\u1e25rdam, \u201cever well-wisher.\u201d The Supreme Lord is always a well-wisher, just like a father or mother. Despite all the offenses of a son, the father and mother are always the son\u2019s well-wisher. Similarly, despite all our offenses and defiance of the desires of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord will give us immediate relief from all the hardships offered by material nature if we simply surrender unto Him, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te). Unfortunately, due to our bad association and great attachment for sense gratification, we do not remember our best friend, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Not knowing this, rascals unhesitatingly go on killing poor animals. So-called human civilization has opened many slaughterhouses for animals in the name of religion or food. Those who are a little religious kill animals in temples, mosques or synagogues, and those who are more fallen maintain various slaughterhouses. Just as in civilized human society the law is a life for a life, no living entity can encroach upon another living entity as far as the Supreme Lord is concerned.

        "purport": " This is a description of material existence. Material existence is experienced when one becomes attached to a woman and forgets his real identity as the eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (na\u1e63\u1e6da-sm\u1e5bti\u1e25). In this way, in one body after another, the living entity perpetually suffers the threefold miseries of material existence. To save human civilization from the darkness of ignorance, this movement was started. The main purpose of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is to enlighten the forgetful living entity and remind him of his original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In this way the living entity can be saved from the catastrophe of ignorance as well as bodily transmigration. As \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has sung: \u201cBecause of my past fruitive activities, I have now fallen into an ocean of nescience. I cannot find any means to get out of this great ocean, which is indeed like an ocean of poison. We are trying to be happy through sense enjoyment, but actually that so-called enjoyment is like food that is too hot and causes burning in the heart. I feel a burning sensation constantly, day and night, and thus my mind cannot find satisfaction.\u201d Material existence is always full of anxiety. People are always trying to find many ways to mitigate anxiety, but because they are not guided by a real leader, they try to forget material anxiety through drink and sex indulgence. Foolish people do not know that by attempting to escape anxiety by drink and sex, they simply increase their duration of material life. It is not possible to escape material anxiety in this way. The word pramad\u0101-sa\u1e45ga-d\u016b\u1e63ita\u1e25 indicates that apart from all other contamination, if one simply remains attached to a woman, that single contamination will be sufficient to prolong one\u2019s miserable material existence. Consequently, in Vedic civilization one is trained from the beginning to give up attachment for women. The first stage of life is brahmac\u0101r\u012b, the second stage g\u1e5bhastha, the third stage v\u0101naprastha, and the fourth stage sanny\u0101sa. All these stages are devised to enable one to detach himself from the association of women."

        "purport": " Since King Pura\u00f1jana thought of his wife at the time of death, he attained the body of a woman in his next birth. This verifies the following verse in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.6): \u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.\u201d When a living entity is accustomed to think of a particular subject matter or become absorbed in a certain type of thought, he will think of that subject at the time of death. At the time of death, one will think of the subject that has occupied his life while he was awake, lightly sleeping or dreaming, or while he was deeply sleeping. After falling from the association of the Supreme Lord, the living entity thus transmigrates from one bodily form to another according to nature\u2019s course, until he finally attains the human form. If he is absorbed in material thoughts and ignorant of spiritual life, and if he does not take shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who solves all questions of birth and death, he will become a woman in the next life, especially if he thinks of his wife. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.31.1), karma\u1e47\u0101 daiva-netre\u1e47a. A living entity acts piously and impiously, and sometimes in both ways. All actions are taken into account, and the living entity is offered a new body by his superiors. Although King Pura\u00f1jana was overly attached to his wife, he nonetheless performed many pious fruitive activities. Consequently, although he took the form of a woman, he was given a chance to be the daughter of a powerful king. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.41): \u201cThe unsuccessful yog\u012b, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people or into a family of rich aristocracy.\u201d If a person falls from the path of bhakti-yoga, God realization, due to attachment to fruitive activity, philosophical speculation or mystic yoga, he is given a chance to take birth in a high and rich family. The higher authorities appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead thus render justice to the living entity according to the living entity\u2019s desires. Although King Pura\u00f1jana was overly absorbed in thoughts of his wife and thus became a woman, he took birth in the family of a king due to his previous pious activities. The conclusion is that all our activities are taken into consideration before we are awarded another body. N\u0101rada Muni therefore advised Vy\u0101sadeva that one should take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional service, and abandon all ordinary occupational duties. This advice was also given by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Although a devotee may fall from the path of spiritual consciousness, he will nonetheless attain a human body in the home of a devotee or a rich man. In this way one can resume his devotional service."

        "translation": "It was fixed that Vaidarbh\u012b, daughter of King Vidarbha, was to be married to a very powerful man, Malayadhvaja, an inhabitant of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du country. After conquering other princes, he married the daughter of King Vidarbha.",
        "purport": " It is customary among k\u1e63atriyas for a princess to be offered under certain conditions. For instance, Draupad\u012b was offered in marriage to one who could pierce a fish with an arrow simply by seeing the reflection of that fish. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a married one of His queens after conquering seven strong bulls. The Vedic system is for a daughter of a king to be offered under certain conditions. Vaidarbh\u012b, the daughter of Vidarbha, was offered to a great devotee and powerful king. Since King Malayadhvaja was both a powerful king and great devotee, he fulfilled all the requirements. The name Malayadhvaja signifies a great devotee who stands as firm as Malaya Hill and, through his propaganda, makes other devotees similarly as firm. Such a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata can prevail over the opinions of all others. A strong devotee makes propaganda against all other spiritual conceptions, namely j\u00f1\u0101na, karma and yoga. With his devotional flag unfurled, he always stands fast to conquer other conceptions of transcendental realization. Whenever there is an argument between a devotee and a nondevotee, the pure, strong devotee comes out victorious. The word p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya comes from the word pa\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, meaning \u201cknowledge.\u201d Unless one is highly learned, he cannot conquer nondevotional conceptions. The word para means \u201ctranscendental,\u201d and pura means \u201ccity.\u201d The para-pura is Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, the kingdom of God, and the word jaya refers to one who can conquer. This means that a pure devotee, who is strong in devotional service and who has conquered all nondevotional conceptions, can also conquer the kingdom of God. In other words, one can conquer the kingdom of God, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, only by rendering devotional service. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called ajita, meaning that no one can conquer Him, but a devotee, by strong devotional service and sincere attachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can easily conquer Him. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fear personified for everyone, but He voluntarily agreed to fear the stick of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, God, cannot be conquered by anyone but His devotee. Such a devotee kindly married the daughter of King Vidarbha."

        "purport": " King Malayadhvaja was a great devotee, and after he married the daughter of King Vidarbha, he gave her one nice daughter, whose eyes were black. Figuratively this means that the daughter of King Malayadhvaja was also bestowed with devotional service, for her eyes were always fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A devotee has no vision in his life other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The seven sons are the seven processes of devotional service \u2014 hearing, chanting, remembering, offering worship, offering prayers, rendering transcendental loving service and serving the lotus feet of the Lord. Of the nine types of devotional service, only seven were immediately given. The balance \u2014 friendship and surrendering everything \u2014 were to be developed later. In other words, devotional service is divided into two categories, namely vidhi-m\u0101rga and r\u0101ga-m\u0101rga. The process of becoming friends with the Lord and sacrificing everything for Him belongs to the category of r\u0101ga-m\u0101rga, the stage of developed devotional service. For the neophyte, the important processes are those of hearing and chanting (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam), remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, worshiping the Deity in the temple, offering prayers, always engaging in the service of the Lord, and worshiping the lotus feet of the Lord. The word yav\u012byasa\u1e25 indicates that these processes are very powerful. After a devotee engages in the processes of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam/ arcana\u1e41 vandana\u1e41 d\u0101syam, and is able to secure these processes, he can later become a devotee capable of rendering spontaneous devotional service, namely sakhyam and \u0101tma-nivedanam. Generally the great \u0101c\u0101ryas who preach devotional service all over the world belong to the category of sakhyam \u0101tma-nivedanam. A neophyte devotee cannot actually become a preacher. The neophyte is advised to execute devotional service in the seven other fields (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam, etc.). If one can successfully execute the preliminary seven items, he can in the future be situated on the platform of sakhyam \u0101tma-nivedanam. The specific mention of Dravi\u1e0da-de\u015ba refers to the five Dravi\u1e0da-de\u015bas in South India. All are very strong in rendering the preliminary devotional processes (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam). Some great \u0101c\u0101ryas, like R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya and Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, also came from Dravi\u1e0da-de\u015ba and became great preachers. They were all situated on the platform of sakhyam \u0101tma-nivedanam."

        "purport": " There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahm\u0101. A manvantara, the life span of one Manu, is given as 71 multiplied by 4,320,000 years. After one such Manu passes on, another Manu begins his life span. In this way the life cycle of the universe is going on. As one Manu follows another, the cult of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is being imparted, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.1): \u201cThe Blessed Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasv\u0101n, and Vivasv\u0101n instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku.\u201d Vivasv\u0101n, the sun-god, imparted Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to one Manu, and this Manu imparted it to his son, who imparted it to yet another Manu. In this way the propagation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is never stopped. No one should think that this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is a new movement. As confirmed by Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, it is a very, very old movement, for it has been passing down from one Manu to another. Among Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas there may be some difference of opinion due to everyone\u2019s personal identity, but despite all personal differences, the cult of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness must go on. We can see that under the instructions of \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja began preaching the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement in an organized way within the past hundred years. The disciples of \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja are all godbrothers, and although there are some differences of opinion, and although we are not acting conjointly, every one of us is spreading this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement according to his own capacity and producing many disciples to spread it all over the world. As far as we are concerned, we have already started the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and many thousands of Europeans and Americans have joined this movement. Indeed, it is spreading like wildfire. The cult of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, based on the nine principles of devotional service (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam/ arcana\u1e41 vandana\u1e41 d\u0101sya\u1e41 sakhyam \u0101tma-nivedanam), will never be stopped. It will go on without distinction of caste, creed, color or country. No one can check it. The word bhok\u1e63yate is very important in this verse. Just as a king gives protection to his citizens, these devotees, following the principles of devotional service, will give protection to all the people of the world. The people of the world are very much harassed by so-called religious-principled sv\u0101m\u012bs, yog\u012bs, karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, but none of these can show the right way to become elevated to the spiritual platform. There are primarily four parties spreading devotional service all over the universe. These are the R\u0101m\u0101nuja samprad\u0101ya, the Madhva samprad\u0101ya, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47usv\u0101mi samprad\u0101ya and the Nimb\u0101rka samprad\u0101ya. The Madhva-Gau\u1e0d\u012bya samprad\u0101ya in particular comes from Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. All these devotees are spreading this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement very widely and giving protection to innocent people who are being so much embarrassed by pseudo-avat\u0101ras,-sv\u0101m\u012bs, -yog\u012bs and others."

        "purport": " The name Agastya Muni is very significant. Agastya Muni represents the mind. The word agastya indicates that the senses do not act independently, and the word muni means \u201cmind.\u201d The mind is the center of all the senses, and thus the senses cannot work independent of the mind. When the mind takes to the cult of bhakti, it engages in devotional service. The cult of bhakti (bhakti-lat\u0101) is the first daughter of Malayadhvaja, and as previously described, her eyes are always upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (asitek\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101m). One cannot render bhakti to any demigod. Bhakti can be rendered only to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25). Thinking the Absolute Truth to be without form, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs say that the word bhakti can apply to any form of worship. If this were the case, a devotee could imagine any demigod or any godly form and worship it. This, however, is not the real fact. The real fact is that bhakti can be applied only to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and His expansions. Therefore bhakti-lat\u0101 is d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrata, the great vow, for when the mind is completely engaged in devotional service, the mind does not fall down. If one tries to advance by other means \u2014 by karma-yoga or j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga \u2014 one will fall down, but if one is fixed in bhakti, he never falls down. Thus from bhakti-lat\u0101 the son D\u1e5b\u1e0dhacyuta is born, and from D\u1e5b\u1e0dhacyuta the next son, Idhmav\u0101ha, is born. The word idhma-v\u0101ha refers to one who carries wood for burning in a sacrifice when approaching a spiritual master. The point is that bhakti-lat\u0101, the cult of devotion, fixes one in his spiritual position. One so fixed never comes down, and he begets children who are strict followers of the \u015b\u0101stric injunctions. As said in the Vedas: In the line of devotional service, those who are initiated are strict followers of the Vedic scriptural injunctions."

Actually, the entire world should be divided among such disciples; everyone should be engaged in preaching the cult of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In other words, when disciples are grown up and are able to preach, the spiritual master should retire and sit down in a solitary place to write and execute nirjana-bhajana. This means sitting silently in a solitary place and executing devotional service. This nirjana-bhajana, which is the silent worship of the Supreme Lord, is not possible for a neophyte devotee. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura never advised a neophyte devotee to go to a solitary place to engage in devotional service. Indeed, he has written a song in this connection: \u201cMy dear mind, what kind of devotee are you? Simply for cheap adoration you sit in a solitary place and pretend to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, but this is all cheating.\u201d Thus Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura advocated that every devotee, under the guidance of an expert spiritual master, preach the bhakti cult, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all over the world. Only when one is mature can he sit in a solitary place and retire from preaching all over the world. Following this example, the devotees of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness now render service as preachers in various parts of the world. Now they can allow the spiritual master to retire from active preaching work. In the last stage of the spiritual master\u2019s life, the devotees of the spiritual master should take preaching activities into their own hands. In this way the spiritual master can sit down in a solitary place and render nirjana-bhajana."

A disciple should always remember that by serving the spiritual master he can easily advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. All the scriptures recommend that it is by pleasing the spiritual master and serving him directly that one can attain the highest perfectional stage of devotional service.

Queen Vaidarbh\u012b\u2019s eyes were very enchanting, just as one\u2019s eyes are madirek\u1e63a\u1e47a when engaged in seeing the temple Deity. Unless one is an advanced devotee, he cannot fix his eyes on the Deity in the temple."

The idea is that one who intends to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness must not eat very much. Devotees used to go to forests, high hills or mountains on pilgrimages, but such severe austerities are not possible in these days. One should instead eat only pras\u0101da and no more than required. According to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava calendar, there are many fasts, such as Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b and the appearance and disappearance days of God and His devotees. All of these are meant to decrease the fat within the body so that one will not sleep more than desired and will not become inactive and lazy. Overindulgence in food will cause a man to sleep more than required. This human form of life is meant for austerity, and austerity means controlling sex, food intake, etc. In this way time can be saved for spiritual activity, and one can purify himself both externally and internally. Thus both body and mind can be cleansed."

        "translation": "Through austerity, King Malayadhvaja in body and mind gradually became equal to the dualities of cold and heat, happiness and distress, wind and rain, hunger and thirst, the pleasant and the unpleasant. In this way he conquered all relativities.",
        "purport": " Liberation means becoming free from the relativities of the world. Unless one is self-realized, he has to undergo the dual struggle of the relative world. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises Arjuna to conquer all relativities through tolerance. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a points out that it is the relativities like winter and summer that give us trouble in the material world. In the winter we do not like taking a bath, but in the summer we wish to take a bath twice, thrice or more a day. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises us not to be disturbed by such relativities and dualities when they come and go. The common man has to undergo much austerity to become equipoised before dualities. One who becomes agitated by the relativities of life has accepted a relative position and must therefore undergo the austerities prescribed in the \u015b\u0101stras to transcend the material body and put an end to material existence. King Malayadhvaja underwent severe austerities by leaving his home, going to Kul\u0101cala, taking his bath in the sacred rivers and eating only vegetables like stems, roots, seeds, flowers and leaves, avoiding any cooked food or grains. These are very, very austere practices. In this age it is very difficult to leave home and go to the forest or the Him\u0101layas to adopt the processes of austerity. Indeed, it is almost impossible. If one is even advised to give up meat-eating, drinking, gambling and illicit sex, one will fail to do so. What, then, would a person do if he went to the Him\u0101layas or Kul\u0101cala? Such acts of renunciation are not possible in this age; therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has advised us to accept the bhakti-yoga process. Bhakti-yoga will automatically liberate a person from the dualities of life. In bhakti-yoga, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the center, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always transcendental. Thus in order to transcend dualities, one must always engage in the service of the Lord, as confirmed by Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d If one is factually engaged in the service of the Lord, bhakti-yoga, he will automatically control his senses, his tongue and so many other things. Once engaged in the bhakti-yoga process with all sincerity, one will have no chance of falling down. Even if one falls down, there is no loss. One\u2019s devotional activities may be stunned or choked for the time being, but as soon as there is another chance, the practitioner begins from the point where he left off."

        "translation": "The daughter of King Vidarbha wore old garments, and she was lean and thin because of her vows of austerity. Since she did not arrange her hair, it became entangled and twisted in locks. Although she remained always near her husband, she was as silent and unagitated as the flame of an undisturbed fire.",
        "purport": " When one begins to burn firewood, there is smoke and agitation in the beginning. Although there are so many disturbances in the beginning, once the fire is completely set, the firewood burns steadily. Similarly, when both husband and wife follow the regulative principles of austerity, they remain silent and are not agitated by sex impulses. At such a time both husband and wife are benefited spiritually. One can attain this stage of life by completely giving up a luxurious mode of life. In this verse the word c\u012bra-v\u0101s\u0101 refers to very old torn garments. The wife especially should remain austere, not desiring luxurious dresses and living standards. She should accept only the bare necessities of life and minimize her eating and sleeping. There should be no question of mating. Simply by engaging in the service of her exalted husband, who must be a pure devotee, the wife will never be agitated by sex impulses. The v\u0101naprastha stage is exactly like this. Although the wife remains with the husband, she undergoes severe austerities and penances so that although both husband and wife live together, there is no question of sex. In this way both husband and wife can live together perpetually. Since the wife is weaker than the husband, this weakness is expressed in this verse with the words upa patim. Upa means \u201cnear to,\u201d or \u201calmost equal to.\u201d Being a man, the husband is generally more advanced than his wife. Nonetheless, the wife is expected to give up all luxurious habits. She should not even dress nicely or comb her hair. Hair-combing is one of the main businesses of women. In the v\u0101naprastha stage the wife should not take care of her hair. Thus her hair will become tangled in knots. Consequently, the wife will no longer be attractive to the husband, and she herself will no longer be agitated by sex impulses. In this way both husband and wife can advance in spiritual consciousness. This advanced stage is called the paramaha\u1e41sa stage, and once it is obtained, both husband and wife can be actually liberated from bodily consciousness. If the disciple remains steady in the service of the spiritual master, he need no longer fear falling down into the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101."

Religion means abiding by the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Religious principles begin from the time one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is the \u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s duty to spread a bona fide religious system and induce everyone to bow down before the Supreme Lord. One executes the religious principles by rendering devotional service, specifically the nine items like hearing, chanting and remembering. Unfortunately, when the \u0101c\u0101rya disappears, rogues and nondevotees take advantage and immediately begin to introduce unauthorized principles in the name of so-called sv\u0101m\u012bs, yog\u012bs, philanthropists, welfare workers and so on. Actually, human life is meant for executing the orders of the Supreme Lord, and this is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.34): \u201cEngage your mind always in thinking of Me and become My devotee. Offer obeisances and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.\u201d The main business of human society is to think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead at all times, to become His devotees, to worship the Supreme Lord and to bow down before Him. The \u0101c\u0101rya, the authorized representative of the Supreme Lord, establishes these principles, but when he disappears, things once again become disordered. The perfect disciples of the \u0101c\u0101rya try to relieve the situation by sincerely following the instructions of the spiritual master. At the present moment practically the entire world is afraid of rogues and nondevotees; therefore this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is started to save the world from irreligious principles. Everyone should cooperate with this movement in order to bring about actual peace and happiness in the world."

        "purport": " It is the long-standing tradition of the Vedic system that a faithful wife dies along with her husband. This is called saha-mara\u1e47a. In India this system was prevalent even to the date of British occupation. At that time, however, a wife who did not wish to die with her husband was sometimes forced to do so by her relatives. Formerly that was not the case \u2014 the wife used to enter the fire voluntarily. The British government stopped this practice, considering it inhuman. However, from the early history of India we find that when Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du died, he was survived by two wives \u2014 M\u0101dr\u012b and Kunt\u012b. The question was whether both should die or one should die. After the death of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, his wives settled that one should remain and the other should go. M\u0101dr\u012b would perish with her husband in the fire, and Kunt\u012b would remain to take charge of the five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava children. Even as late as 1936 we saw a devoted wife voluntarily enter the fire of her husband. This indicates that a devotee\u2019s wife must be prepared to act in such a way. Similarly, a devoted disciple of the spiritual master would rather die with the spiritual master than fail to execute the spiritual master\u2019s mission. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes down upon this earth to reestablish the principles of religion, so His representative, the spiritual master, also comes to reestablish religious principles. It is the duty of the disciples to take charge of the mission of the spiritual master and execute it properly. Otherwise the disciple should decide to die along with the spiritual master. In other words, to execute the will of the spiritual master, the disciple should be prepared to lay down his life and abandon all personal considerations."

        "translation": "My dear King, one br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who was an old friend of King Pura\u00f1jana, came to that place and began to pacify the Queen with sweet words.",
        "purport": " The appearance of an old friend in the form of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is very significant. In His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the old friend of everyone. According to Vedic injunction, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sitting with the living entity side by side. According to the \u015bruti-mantra (dv\u0101 supar\u1e47\u0101 sayuj\u0101 sakh\u0101y\u0101\u1e25), the Lord is sitting within the heart of every living entity as suh\u1e5bt, the best friend. The Lord is always eager to have the living entity come home, back to Godhead. Sitting with the living entity as witness, the Lord gives him all chances to enjoy himself materially, but whenever there is an opportunity, the Lord gives good counsel and advises the living entity to abandon trying to become happy through material adjustment and instead turn his face toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him. When one becomes serious to follow the mission of the spiritual master, his resolution is tantamount to seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained before, this means meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the instruction of the spiritual master. This is technically called v\u0101\u1e47\u012b-sev\u0101. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura states in his Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 commentary on the verse vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101 buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana (Bg. 2.41) that one should serve the words of the spiritual master. The disciple must stick to whatever the spiritual master orders. Simply by following on that line, one sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param\u0101tm\u0101, appeared before the Queen as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, but why didn\u2019t He appear in His original form as \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks that unless one is very highly elevated in loving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot see Him as He is. Nonetheless, if one sticks to the principles enunciated by the spiritual master, somehow or other he is in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since the Lord is in the heart, He can advise a sincere disciple from within. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d In conclusion, if a disciple is very serious to execute the mission of the spiritual master, he immediately associates with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by v\u0101\u1e47\u012b or vapu\u1e25. This is the only secret of success in seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Instead of being eager to see the Lord in some bush of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana while at the same time engaging in sense gratification, if one instead sticks to the principle of following the words of the spiritual master, he will see the Supreme Lord without difficulty. \u015ar\u012bla Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura has therefore said: \u201cIf I am engaged in devotional service unto You, my dear Lord, then very easily can I perceive Your presence everywhere. And as far as liberation is concerned, I think that liberation stands at my door with folded hands, waiting to serve me \u2014 and all material conveniences of dharma [religiosity], artha [economic development] and k\u0101ma [sense gratification] stand with her.\u201d (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kar\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta 107) If one is very highly advanced in devotional service, he will have no difficulty in seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one engages in the service of the spiritual master, he not only sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead but attains liberation. As far as material conveniences are concerned, they automatically come, just as the maidservants of a queen follow the queen wherever she goes. Liberation is no problem for the pure devotee, and all material conveniences are simply awaiting him at all stages of life."

Don\u2019t you recognize Me? I am your eternal friend. You may remember that many times in the past you have consulted Me.",
        "purport": " When a person\u2019s relative dies, renunciation is automatically visible. Consultation with the Supersoul seated within everyone\u2019s heart is possible only when one is completely free from the contamination of material attachment. One who is sincere and pure gets an opportunity to consult with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature sitting within everyone\u2019s heart. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 is always the caitya-guru, the spiritual master within, and He comes before one externally as the instructor and initiator spiritual master. The Lord can reside within the heart, and He can also come out before a person and give him instructions. Thus the spiritual master is not different from the Supersoul sitting within the heart. An uncontaminated soul or living entity can get a chance to meet the Param\u0101tm\u0101 face to face. Just as one gets a chance to consult with the Param\u0101tm\u0101 within his heart, one also gets a chance to see Him actually situated before him. Then one can take instructions from the Supersoul directly. This is the duty of the pure devotee: to see the bona fide spiritual master and consult with the Supersoul within the heart. When the br\u0101hma\u1e47a asked the woman who the man lying on the floor was, she answered that he was her spiritual master and that she was perplexed about what to do in his absence. At such a time the Supersoul immediately appears, provided the devotee is purified in heart by following the directions of the spiritual master. A sincere devotee who follows the instructions of the spiritual master certainly gets direct instructions from his heart from the Supersoul. Thus a sincere devotee is always helped directly or indirectly by the spiritual master and the Supersoul. This is confirmed in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta: guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja. If the devotee serves his spiritual master sincerely, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a automatically becomes pleased. Yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavad-pras\u0101da\u1e25: by satisfying the spiritual master, one automatically satisfies K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the devotee becomes enriched by both the spiritual master and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Supersoul is eternally the friend of the living entity and always remains with him. The Supersoul has always been ready to help the living entity, even before the creation of this material world. It is therefore stated here, yen\u0101gre vicacartha. The word agre means \u201cbefore the creation.\u201d Thus the Supersoul has been accompanying the living entity since before the creation."

        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.27): \u201cO scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate.\u201d This is an explanation of how the living entity falls down into this material world. In the spiritual world there is no duality, nor is there hate. The Supreme Personality of Godhead expands Himself into many. In order to enjoy bliss more and more, the Supreme Lord expands Himself in different categories. As mentioned in the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a, He expands Himself in vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva (the sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba expansion) and in His marginal potency (the vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba, or the living entity). These expanded living entities are innumerable, just as the minute molecules of sunshine are innumerable expansions of the sun. The vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba expansions, the marginal potencies of the Lord, are the living entities. When the living entities desire to enjoy themselves, they develop a consciousness of duality and come to hate the service of the Lord. In this way the living entities fall into the material world. In the Prema-vivarta it is said: The natural position of the living entity is to serve the Lord in a transcendental loving attitude. When the living entity wants to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself or imitate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he falls down into the material world. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme father, His affection for the living entity is eternal. When the living entity falls down into the material world, the Supreme Lord, through His sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba expansion (Param\u0101tm\u0101), keeps company with the living entity. In this way the living entity may some day return home, back to Godhead. By misusing his independence, the living entity falls down from the service of the Lord and takes a position in this material world as an enjoyer \u2014 that is to say, the living entity takes his position within a material body. Wanting to take a very exalted position, the living entity instead becomes entangled in a repetition of birth and death. He selects his position as a human being, a demigod, a cat, a dog, a tree, etc. In this way the living entity selects a body out of the 8,400,000 forms and tries to satisfy himself by a variety of material enjoyment. The Supersoul, however, does not like him to do this. Consequently, the Supersoul instructs him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord then takes charge of the living entity. But unless the living entity is uncontaminated by material desires, he cannot surrender to the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29) the Lord says: \u201cThe sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.\u201d The Supreme Lord is the supreme friend of everyone; however, no one can take advantage of the supreme friend\u2019s instructions while making his own plans to become happy and entangling himself in the modes of material nature. When there is creation, the living entities take on different forms according to past desires. This means that all the species or forms of life are simultaneously created. Darwin\u2019s theory stating that no human being existed from the beginning but that humans evolved after many, many years is simply a nonsensical theory. From Vedic literature we find that the first creature within the universe is Lord Brahm\u0101. Being the most intelligent personality, Lord Brahm\u0101 could take charge of creating all the variety found within this material world."

In the spiritual world both the Lord and the living entities live together very peacefully. Since the living entity remains engaged in the service of the Lord, they both share a blissful life in the spiritual world. However, when the living entity wants to enjoy himself, he falls down into the material world. Even while he is in that position, the Lord remains with him as the Supersoul, his intimate friend. Because of his forgetfulness, the living entity does not know that the Supreme Lord is accompanying him as the Supersoul. In this way the living entity remains conditioned in each and every millennium. Although the Lord follows him as a friend, the living entity, because of forgetful material existence, does not recognize Him."

        "purport": " When the living entity falls down, he goes into the material world, which was created by the external energy of the Lord. This external energy is described herein as \u201csome woman,\u201d or prak\u1e5bti. This material world is composed of material elements, ingredients supplied by the mahat-tattva, the total material energy. The material world, created by this external energy, becomes the so-called home of the conditioned soul. Within this material world the conditioned soul accepts different apartments, or different bodily forms, and then travels about. Sometimes he travels in the higher planetary systems and sometimes in the lower systems. Sometimes he travels in higher species of life and sometimes in lower species. He has been wandering within this material universe since time immemorial. As explained by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: The living entity wanders into many species of life, but he is fortunate when he once again meets his friend, either in person or through His representative. Actually, it is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who personally advises all living entities to return home, back to Godhead. Sometimes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sends His representative, who, delivering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s very message, canvasses all living entities to return home, back to Godhead. Unfortunately the living entity is so greatly attached to material enjoyment that he does not take the instructions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His representative very seriously. This material tendency is mentioned in this verse as gr\u0101mya-mati\u1e25, sense gratification. The word mah\u012bm means \u201cwithin this material world.\u201d All living entities within this material world are sensually inclined. Consequently they become entangled in different types of bodies and suffer the pangs of material existence."

The living entity enters the material creation, but because he is bewildered by the material energy, he appears to be hidden. The bodily conception of life is prominent because of ignorance (n\u0101vabudhyate). Intelligence is described in the feminine gender, but owing to her prominence in all activities, she is described in this verse as adh\u012b\u015ba\u1e25, the controller. The living entity lives by means of fire, water and food grains. It is through the combination of these three that the body is maintained. Consequently the body is called prak\u1e5bti, material creation. All the elements gradually combine to form flesh, bone, blood and so on. All these appear as various apartments. It is said in the Vedas that the digested foods are ultimately divided into three. The solid portion becomes stool, and the semiliquid portion turns into flesh. The liquid portion turns yellow and is again divided into three. One of these liquid portions is called urine. Similarly, the fiery portion is divided into three, and one is called bone. Out of the five elements, fire, water and food grains are very important. These three are mentioned in the previous verse, whereas sky (ether) and air are not mentioned. This is all explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.20): \u201cMaterial nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature.\u201d Prak\u1e5bti, material nature, and puru\u1e63a, the living entity, are eternal.

        "purport": " In the material world many living entities come into contact with one another and, increasing their attachment to a particular type of body, become related as father, husband, mother, wife, etc. Actually every living entity is a separate individual being, and it is because of his contact with matter that he comes together with other bodies and becomes falsely related. False bodies create various associations in the name of family, community, society and nationality. Actually every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the living entities are overly engrossed in the material body. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appears and gives instructions in the form of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and Vedic literatures. The Supreme Lord gives these instructions because He is the eternal friend of the living entities. His instructions are important because by them the living entity can obtain liberation from bodily engagement. As water passes down a river, many straws and grasses are carried from the shore. These straws and grasses come together in the river\u2019s current, but when the waves toss this way and that, they are separated and carried somewhere else. Similarly, the innumerable living entities within this material world are being carried by the waves of material nature. Sometimes the waves bring them together, and they form friendships and relate to one another on a bodily basis of family, community or nationality. Eventually they are thrown out of association by the waves of material nature. This process has been going on since the creation of material nature. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura sings: \u201cMy dear living entities, you are being carried away by the waves of material nature. Sometimes you are on the surface, sometimes you are being drowned. In this way your eternal life is being spoiled. If you simply catch hold of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and take shelter of His lotus feet, you will once again get free from all the miserable material conditions.\u201d In this verse the words suh\u1e5bt, \u201cwell-wisher,\u201d and tava, \u201cyour,\u201d are very significant. One\u2019s so-called husband, relative, son, father or whatever cannot actually be a well-wisher. The only actual well-wisher is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29): suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m. Society, friendship, love and well-wishers are all simply results of being packed in different bodies. One should know this well and try to get out of this bodily encagement into which one is thrown birth after birth. One should take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and return home, back to Godhead."

        "purport": " The factual position of both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity is qualitatively one. The Supreme Lord is the Supreme Spirit, the Supersoul, and the living entity is the individual spiritual soul. Even though both of them are original spiritual identities, the living entity forgets his identity when he comes in contact with material nature and becomes conditioned. At such a time he identifies himself as a product of the material nature. Because of the material body, he forgets that he is the eternal (san\u0101tana) part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in this way: mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25. The word san\u0101tana is found in several places in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Both the Lord and the living entity are san\u0101tana (eternal), and there is also a place known as san\u0101tana, beyond this material nature. The real residence of both the living entity and God is the domain of san\u0101tana, not this material world. The material world is the temporary, external energy of the Lord, and the living entity is placed in this material world because he wanted to imitate the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this material world he tries to enjoy his senses to his best capacity. All the activities of the conditioned soul within this material world are perpetually taking place in different types of bodies, but when the living entity acquires developed consciousness, he should try to rectify his situation and again become a member of the spiritual world. The process by which one can return home, back to Godhead, is bhakti-yoga, sometimes called san\u0101tana-dharma. Instead of accepting a temporary occupational duty based on the material body, one should take to the process of san\u0101tana-dharma, or bhakti-yoga, so that he can put an end to this perpetual bondage in material bodies and return home, back to Godhead. As long as human society works on the basis of false material identification, all the so-called advancements of science and philosophy are simply useless. They only serve to mislead human society. Andh\u0101 yath\u0101ndhair upan\u012byam\u0101n\u0101\u1e25: in the material world, the blind simply lead the blind."

        "translation": "As a person sees the reflection of his body in a mirror to be one with himself and not different, whereas others actually see two bodies, so in our material condition, in which the living being is affected and yet not affected, there is a difference between God and the living entity.",
        "purport": " Being affected by the conditioning of matter, M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers cannot see the difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entity. When the sun is reflected in a pot of water, the sun knows that there is no difference between himself and the reflected sun in the water. Those in ignorance, however, perceive that there are many small suns reflected in each and every pot. As far as the brilliance is concerned, there is brilliance both in the original sun and in the reflections, but the reflections are small, whereas the original sun is very large. Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophers conclude that the living entity is simply a small sample of the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. Qualitatively, God and the living entities are one, but quantitatively the living entities are small fragments of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is full, powerful and opulent. In the previous verse, the Lord says, \u201cMy dear friend, you and I are not different.\u201d This nondifference refers to qualitative oneness, for it was not necessary for the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Personality, to remind the conditioned soul that he is not one in quantity. The self-realized soul never thinks that he and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are one in every respect. Although he and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are one in quality, the living entity is prone to forget his spiritual identity, whereas the Supreme Personality never forgets. This is the difference between lipta and alipta. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally alipta, uncontaminated by the external energy. The conditioned soul, however, being in contact with material nature, forgets his real identity; therefore when he sees himself in the conditioned state, he identifies himself with the body. For the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, there is no difference between the body and the soul. He is completely soul; He has no material body. Although the Supersoul, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and the individual soul are both within the body, the Supersoul is devoid of designation, whereas the conditioned soul is designated by his particular type of body. The Supersoul is called antary\u0101m\u012b, and He is extensive. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.3). K\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a\u1e41 c\u0101pi m\u0101\u1e41 viddhi sarva-k\u1e63etre\u1e63u bh\u0101rata: \u201cO scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies.\u201d The Supersoul is present in everyone\u2019s body, whereas the individual soul is conditioned in one particular type of body. The individual soul cannot understand what is taking place in another\u2019s body, but the Supersoul knows very well what is happening in all bodies. In other words, the Supersoul is always present in His full spiritual position, whereas the individual soul is prone to forget himself. Nor is the individual soul present everywhere. Generally in his conditioned state the individual soul cannot understand his relationship with the Supersoul, but sometimes, when he is free from all conditional existence, he can see the real difference between the Supersoul and himself. When the Supersoul tells the conditioned soul, \u201cYou and I are one and the same,\u201d it is to remind the conditioned soul of his spiritual identity as being qualitatively one. In the Third Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.28.40), it is said: Fire has different features. There is flame, the sparks and the smoke. Although these are one in quality, there is still a difference between the fire, the flame, the spark and the smoke. The living entity becomes conditioned, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is different because He does not become conditioned at any point. In the Vedas it is stated, \u0101tm\u0101 tath\u0101 p\u1e5bthag dra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 bhagav\u0101n brahma-sa\u1e41j\u00f1ita\u1e25: \u0101tm\u0101 is the individual soul as well as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the seer of everything. Although both are spirit, there is always a difference. In the sm\u1e5bti it is also said, yath\u0101gne\u1e25 k\u1e63udr\u0101 visphuli\u1e45g\u0101 vyuccaranti: Just as sparks manifest in a large fire, similarly the small individual souls are present in the big spiritual flame. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.4) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, mat-sth\u0101ni sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni na c\u0101ha\u1e41 te\u1e63v avasthita\u1e25: \u201cAll beings are in Me, but I am not in them.\u201d Although all living beings are resting in Him, as small fiery sparks rest on a large flame, both are differently situated. Similarly, in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said: \u201cFire is situated in one place, but it distributes heat and light. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is distributing His energies in different ways.\u201d The living entity is but one of these energies (marginal energy). The energy and the energetic are one in one sense, but they are differently situated as energy and the energetic. Similarly, the sac-cid-\u0101nanda form confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25) is different from that of the living entity in both his conditioned and liberated states. Only atheists consider the living entity and the Personality of Godhead equal in all respects. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore says, m\u0101y\u0101v\u0101di-bh\u0101\u1e63ya \u015bunile haya sarva-n\u0101\u015ba: \u201cIf one follows the instructions of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers and believes that the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual soul are one, his understanding of real philosophy is forever doomed.\u201d"

        "translation": "In this way both swans live together in the heart. When the one swan is instructed by the other, he is situated in his constitutional position. This means he regains his original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which was lost because of his material attraction.",
        "purport": " Here it is clearly stated, ha\u1e41so ha\u1e41sena pratibodhita\u1e25: the individual soul and the Supersoul are both compared to swans (ha\u1e41sa) because they are white, or uncontaminated. One swan, however, is superior and is the instructor of the other. When the inferior swan is separated from the other swan, he is attracted to material enjoyment. This is the cause of his falldown. When he hears the instructions of the other swan, he understands his real position and is again revived to his original consciousness. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, comes down (avat\u0101ra) to deliver His devotees and kill the demons. He also gives His sublime instructions in the form of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The individual soul has to understand his position by the grace of the Lord and the spiritual master because the text of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 cannot be understood simply by academic qualifications. One has to learn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from a realized soul: \u201cJust try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201d (Bg. 4.34) Thus one has to select a bona fide spiritual master and become enlightened to his original consciousness. In this way the individual soul can understand that he is always subordinate to the Supersoul. As soon as he declines to remain subordinate and tries to become an enjoyer, he begins his material conditioning. When he abandons this spirit of being an individual owner or enjoyer, he becomes situated in his liberated state. The word sva-stha\u1e25, meaning \u201csituated in one\u2019s original position,\u201d is very significant in this verse. When one gives up his unwanted attitude of superiority, he becomes situated in his original position. The word tad-vyabhic\u0101re\u1e47a is also significant, for it indicates that when one is separated from God due to disobedience, his real sense is lost. Again, by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and guru, he can be properly situated in his liberated position. These verses are spoken by \u015ar\u012bla N\u0101rada Muni, and his purpose in speaking them is to revive our consciousness. Although the living entity and the Supersoul are one in quality, the individual soul has to pursue the instruction of the Supersoul. That is the state of liberation."

        "translation": "My dear King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, is celebrated to be known indirectly. Thus I have described the story of Pura\u00f1jana to you. Actually it is an instruction for self-realization.",
        "purport": " There are many similar stories in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as for self-realization. As stated in the Vedas, parok\u1e63a-priy\u0101 iva hi dev\u0101\u1e25. There are many stories in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as that are intended to interest ordinary men in transcendental subjects, but actually these refer to real facts. They are not to be considered stories without a transcendental purpose. Some of them refer to real historical facts. One should be interested, however, in the real purport of the story. Indirect instruction is quickly understandable for a common man. Factually the path of bhakti-yoga is the path of hearing directly about the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25), but those who are not interested in hearing directly about the activities of the Lord, or who cannot understand them, can very effectively hear such stories and fables as this one narrated by N\u0101rada Muni. The following is a glossary of some of the important words in this chapter. \u0100de\u015ba-k\u0101r\u012b. The actions resulting from sinful activities. Agastya. The mind. Am\u0101tya. The governor of the senses, the mind. Arbuda-arbuda. Various types of \u015brava\u1e47a and k\u012brtana of the Supreme Lord\u2019s name, quality, form and so on. Ari. Impediments like disease. Bhoga. Enjoyment. Herein this word refers to real enjoyment in spiritual life. Bh\u1e5btya. The servants of the body, namely the senses. Dravi\u1e0da-r\u0101ja. Devotional service or a person eligible to act in devotional service. Dv\u0101ra. The doors of the body, such as the eyes and ears. G\u1e5bha. Home. For spiritual cultivation one requires an undisturbed place or the good association of devotees. Idhmav\u0101ha. The devotee who approaches the spiritual master. Idhma refers to wood that is taken to burn as fuel for a fire. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b is supposed to take this idhma to ignite the fire used in performing sacrifices. By spiritual instruction a brahmac\u0101ri is trained to ignite a fire and offer oblations in the morning. He is supposed to go to the spiritual master to take lessons on transcendental subject matter, and the Vedic injunction is that when approaching the spiritual master one must carry with him fuel to perform yaj\u00f1as, or sacrifices. The exact Vedic injunction is as follows: \u201cTo learn transcendental subject matter, one must approach the spiritual master. In doing so, he should carry fuel to burn in sacrifice. The symptom of such a spiritual master is that he is expert in understanding the Vedic conclusion, and therefore he constantly engages in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.2.12) By serving such a bona fide spiritual master, gradually a conditioned soul becomes detached from material enjoyment and invariably makes progress in spiritual realization under the direction of the spiritual master. Those who are misled by the illusory energy are never interested in approaching a spiritual master to make life successful. J\u0101y\u0101. Intelligence. J\u012br\u1e47a-sarpa. The fatigued air of life. K\u0101lakany\u0101. The invalidity of old age. K\u0101ma. A high fever. Kul\u0101cala. The place where there is no disturbance. Ku\u1e6dumbin\u012b. Intelligence. Madirek\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101. Madirek\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 refers to one whose eyes are so attractive that one who observes them becomes maddened by her. In other words, madirek\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 means a very beautiful young girl. According to J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, madirek\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 means the personified deity of bhakti. If one is attracted by the bhakti cult, he becomes engaged in the service of the Lord and the spiritual master, and thus his life becomes successful. Vaidarbh\u012b, the woman, became a follower of her husband. As she left her comfortable home for the service of her husband, a serious student of spiritual understanding must give up everything for the service of the spiritual master. As stated by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101da\u1e25: if one wants actual success in life, he must strictly follow the instructions of the spiritual master. By following such instructions, one is sure to make rapid progress in spiritual life. This statement by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b is in pursuance of the following injunction from the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (6.23): \u201cOnly unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.\u201d In the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad it is said, \u0101c\u0101ryav\u0101n puru\u1e63o veda: \u201cOne who approaches a bona fide spiritual master can understand everything about spiritual realization.\u201d Malayadhvaja. A nice devotee who is like sandalwood. Pa\u00f1c\u0101la. The five sense objects. Paricchada. The total aggregate of the senses. Paura-jana. The seven elements that constitute the body. Pautra. Patience and gravity. Prajv\u0101ra. A kind of fever called vi\u1e63\u1e47u-jv\u0101ra. Pratikriy\u0101. Counteracting agents such as mantras and medicines. Pura-p\u0101laka. The life air. Putra. Consciousness. Sainika. The condition of threefold miseries. Sapta-suta. The seven sons, namely hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, worshiping the Deity and becoming a servant of the Lord. Sauh\u1e5bdya. Endeavor. Suta. The son of Vaidarbh\u012b, or, in other words, one who is somewhat advanced in fruitive activities and who comes in contact with a devotee spiritual master. Such a person becomes interested in the subject matter of devotional service. Vaidarbh\u012b. The woman who was formerly a man but took birth as a woman in his next life because of too much attachment to woman. Darbha means ku\u015ba grass. In fruitive activities, or karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bya ceremonies, one requires ku\u015ba grass. Thus vaidarbh\u012b refers to one who takes birth in a family of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bya understanding. However, if by karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da activities one by chance comes in contact with a devotee, as Vaidarbh\u012b did when she married Malayadhvaja, his life becomes successful. He then pursues the devotional service of the Lord. The conditioned soul becomes liberated simply by following the instructions of the bona fide spiritual master. Vidarbha-r\u0101jasi\u1e41ha. The best of persons who are expert in fruitive activities. V\u012brya. One who has mercy. Yavana. The servant of Yamar\u0101ja."
