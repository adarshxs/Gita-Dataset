For example, \u015ar\u012b V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana-dh\u0101ma is nondifferent from \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (tad-dh\u0101ma v\u1e5bnd\u0101vanam) because at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana the Lord enjoys the transcendental bliss of His internal potency. Similarly, the house of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas was also the source of transcendental bliss for the Lord. It is mentioned here that the Lord identified the house with His own Self. Thus the house of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas was as good as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and Vidura should not have given up that place of transcendental bliss. Therefore the reason for his quitting the house was not exactly family misunderstanding; rather, Vidura took the opportunity to meet \u1e5a\u1e63i Maitreya and discuss transcendental knowledge. For a saintly person like Vidura, any disturbance due to worldly affairs is insignificant. Such disturbances, however, are sometimes favorable for higher realization, and therefore Vidura took advantage of a family misunderstanding in order to meet Maitreya \u1e5a\u1e63i."

        "purport": " Questions and answers among different classes of men have different value. Inquiries by mercantile men in a business exchange cannot be expected to be highly purposeful in spiritual values. Questions and answers by different classes of men can be guessed by the caliber of the persons concerned. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the discussion was between Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna, the Supreme Person and the supreme devotee respectively. The Lord admitted Arjuna to be His devotee and friend (Bg. 4.3), and therefore any sane man can guess that the discussion was on the topic of the bhakti-yoga system. Actually the whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is based on the principle of bhakti-yoga. There is a difference between karma and karma-yoga. Karma is regulated action for the enjoyment of the fruit by the performer, but karma-yoga is action performed by the devotee for the satisfaction of the Lord. Karma-yoga is based on bhakti, or pleasing the Lord, whereas karma is based on pleasing the senses of the performer himself. According to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, one is advised to approach a bona fide spiritual master when one is actually inclined to question from an elevated level of spiritual understanding. A common man who has no interest in spiritual values has no need to approach a spiritual master just as a matter of following fashion. As a student, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was serious about learning the science of God, and \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was a bona fide spiritual master in the transcendental science. Both of them knew that the topics discussed by Vidura and \u1e5a\u1e63i Maitreya were elevated, and thus Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was very interested in learning from the bona fide spiritual master."

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everyone\u2019s Lord, yet because He was the transcendental friend of Arjuna, He gladly accepted the role of messenger, exactly like an ordinary friend. That is the beauty of the Lord\u2019s behavior with His pure devotees. He reached the assembly and spoke about peace, and the message was relished by Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and other great leaders because it was spoken by the Lord Himself. But due to the exhaustion of the pious results of their past deeds, Duryodhana, or his father, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, did not take the message very seriously. That is the way of persons who have no credit of pious deeds. By past pious deeds, one may become the king of a country, but because the results of the pious acts of Duryodhana and company were dwindling, it became evident from their actions that they were sure to lose the kingdom to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. The message of Godhead is always like nectar to the devotees, but it is just the opposite to the nondevotees. Sugar candy is always sweet to a healthy man, but it tastes very bitter to persons suffering from jaundice."

The first thing he said was that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was intimately related with them as their cousin. Because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is worshipable by all br\u0101hma\u1e47as and demigods, who are the controllers of the universal affairs. Besides that, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His family members, the royal order of the Yadu dynasty, were the conquerors of all kings of the world. The k\u1e63atriyas used to fight the kings of various dominions and kidnap their beautiful princess-daughters after conquering their relatives. This system was laudable because the k\u1e63atriyas and the princesses would be married only on the basis of the chivalry of the conquering k\u1e63atriya. All the young princes of the Yadu dynasty married the daughters of other kings in this way, by chivalrous force, and thus they were conquerors of all the kings of the world. Vidura wanted to impress upon his elder brother that fighting with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas was fraught with many dangers because they were supported by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who had conquered, even in His childhood, demons like Ka\u1e41sa and Jar\u0101sandha and demigods like Brahm\u0101 and Indra.

The son can protect the father\u2019s soul when the father is dead by offering sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This system is still prevalent in India. After the death of his father, a son goes to offer sacrifices at the lotus feet of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u at Gay\u0101 and thus delivers the father\u2019s soul if the father is fallen. But if the son is already an enemy of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, how, in such an inimical mood, can he offer sacrifice unto Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s lotus feet? Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is directly the Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and Duryodhana was inimical to Him. He would therefore be unable to protect his father, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, after his death. He himself was to fall down because of his faithlessness towards Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. How, then, could he protect his father? Vidura advised Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra to get rid of such an unworthy son as Duryodhana as soon as possible if he was at all anxious to see to the good of his family. According to the moral instructions of C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, \u201cWhat is the use of a son who is neither a learned man nor a devotee of the Lord?\u201d If a son is not a devotee of the Supreme Lord, he is just like blind eyes \u2014 a source of trouble. A physician may sometimes advise the extrication of such useless eyes from their sockets so that one can be relieved of the constant trouble. Duryodhana was exactly like blind, troubling eyes; he would be a source of great trouble to the family of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, as foreseen by Vidura. Vidura therefore rightly advised his eldest brother to get rid of this source of trouble. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was wrongly maintaining such personified offense under the mistaken impression that Duryodhana was a good son, able to liberate his father."

Such is the situation of palace life and the intricacies of diplomacy that even a faultless person like Vidura could be charged with something abominable and punished. Vidura was struck with wonder at such unexpected behavior from his nephew Duryodhana, and before anything actually happened, he decided to leave the palace for good."

        "purport": " A pure devotee of the Lord is never perturbed by an awkward position created by the external energy of the Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.27) it is stated: A conditioned soul is absorbed in material existence under the influence of different modes of external energy. Absorbed in the false ego, he thinks that he is doing everything by himself. The external energy of the Lord, the material nature, is fully under the control of the Supreme Lord, and the conditioned soul is fully under the grip of the external energy. Therefore, the conditioned soul is fully under the control of the law of the Lord. But, due to illusion only, he thinks himself independent in his activities. Duryodhana was acting under such influence of the external nature, by which he would be vanquished at the ultimate end. He could not accept the sound advice of Vidura, but on the contrary he insulted that great soul, who was the well-wisher of his whole family. Vidura could understand this because he was a pure devotee of the Lord. In spite of being very strongly insulted by Duryodhana\u2019s words, Vidura could see that Duryodhana, under the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, the external energy, was making progress on the path toward his own ruination. He therefore considered the acts of the external energy to be supreme, yet he also saw how the internal energy of the Lord helped him in that particular situation. A devotee is always in a renounced temperament because the worldly attractions can never satisfy him. Vidura was never attracted by the royal palace of his brother. He was always ready to leave the place and devote himself completely to the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Now he got the opportunity by the grace of Duryodhana, and instead of being sorry at the strong words of insult, he thanked him from within because it gave him the chance to live alone in a holy place and fully engage in the devotional service of the Lord. The word gata-vyatha\u1e25 (without being sorry) is significant here because Vidura was relieved from the tribulations which trouble every man entangled in material activities. He therefore thought that there was no need to defend his brother with his bow because his brother was meant for ruination. Thus he left the palace before Duryodhana could act. M\u0101y\u0101, the supreme energy of the Lord, acted here both internally and externally."

        "translation": "By his piety, Vidura achieved the advantages of the pious Kauravas. After leaving Hastin\u0101pura, he took shelter of many places of pilgrimages, which are the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. With a desire to gain a high order of pious life, he traveled to holy places where thousands of transcendental forms of the Lord are situated.",
        "purport": " Vidura was undoubtedly a highly elevated and pious soul; otherwise he would not have taken his birth in the Kaurava family. To have high parentage, to possess wealth, to be highly learned and to have great personal beauty are all due to past pious acts. But such pious possessions are not sufficient for obtaining the grace of the Lord and being engaged in His transcendental loving service. Vidura considered himself less pious, and therefore he decided to travel to all the great places of pilgrimage in the world in order to achieve greater piety and advance nearer to the Lord. At that time, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was personally present in the world, and Vidura could have at once approached Him directly, but he did not do so because he was not sufficiently freed from sin. One cannot be one-hundred-percent devoted to the Lord unless and until he is completely free from all effects of sin. Vidura was conscious that by the association of the diplomatic Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Duryodhana he had lost his piety and was therefore not fit to associate at once with the Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.28) this is confirmed in the following verse: Persons who are sinful asuras like Ka\u1e41sa and Jar\u0101sandha cannot think of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Only those who are pure devotees, those who follow the regulative principles of religious life as prescribed in the scriptures, are able to engage themselves in karma-yoga and then j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and thereafter, by pure meditation, can understand pure consciousness. When God consciousness is developed, one can take advantage of the association of pure devotees. Sy\u0101n mahat-sevay\u0101 vipr\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e47ya-t\u012brtha-ni\u1e63eva\u1e47\u0101t: one is able to associate with the Lord even during the existence of this life. Places of pilgrimages are meant for eradicating the sins of the pilgrims, and they are distributed all over the universe just to give facility to all concerned for attaining pure existence and God realization. One should not be satisfied, however, merely by visiting the places of pilgrimage and performing one\u2019s prescribed duties; he should be eager to meet the great souls who are already there, engaged in the service of the Lord. In each and every place of pilgrimage, the Lord is present in His various transcendental forms. These forms are called arc\u0101-m\u016brtis, or forms of the Lord which can be easily appreciated by the common man. The Lord is transcendental to our mundane senses. He cannot be seen with our present eyes, nor can He be heard with our present ears. To the degree that we have entered into the service of the Lord or to the proportion that our lives are freed from sins, we can perceive the Lord. But even though we are not free from sins, the Lord is kind enough to allow us the facility of seeing Him in His arc\u0101-m\u016brtis in the temple. The Lord is all-powerful, and therefore He is able to accept our service by presentation of His arc\u0101 form. No one, therefore, should foolishly think the arc\u0101 in the temple to be an idol. Such an arc\u0101-m\u016brti is not an idol but the Lord Himself, and to the proportion that one is free from sins, he is able to know the significance of the arc\u0101-m\u016brti. The guidance of a pure devotee is therefore always required. In the land of Bh\u0101ratavar\u1e63a there are many hundreds and thousands of places of pilgrimage distributed all over the country, and by traditional practice the common man visits such holy places during all seasons of the year. Some of the arc\u0101 representations of the Lord situated in different places of pilgrimage are mentioned herewith. The Lord is present at Mathur\u0101 (the birthplace of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) as \u0100di-ke\u015bava; the Lord is present at Pur\u012b (Orissa) as Lord Jagann\u0101tha (also known as Puru\u1e63ottama); He is present at Allahabad (Pray\u0101ga) as Bindu-m\u0101dhava; at Mandara Hill He is present as Madhus\u016bdana. In the \u0100nand\u0101ra\u1e47ya, He is known as V\u0101sudeva, Padman\u0101bha and Jan\u0101rdana; at Vi\u1e63\u1e47uk\u0101\u00f1c\u012b, He is known as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; and at M\u0101y\u0101pura, He is known as Hari. There are millions and billions of such arc\u0101 forms of the Lord distributed all over the universe. All these arc\u0101-m\u016brtis are summarized in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta in the following words: \u201cThe Lord has so distributed Himself all over the universe just to give pleasure to the devotees, to give the common man facility to eradicate his sins, and to establish religious principles in the world.\u201d"

There is no difference between the potencies of the arc\u0101 and those of the personal forms of the Lord. The example of the postbox and post office may be applied here. The little postboxes distributed all over the city have the same potency as the postal system in general. The duty of the post office is to carry letters from one place to another. If one puts letters in postboxes authorized by the general post office, the function of carrying letters is performed without a doubt. Similarly, the arc\u0101-m\u016brti can also deliver the same unlimited potency of the Lord as when He is personally present.

At any moment there may be a flare-up of fire in the forest due to friction. No one goes to the forest to set it on fire, but due only to friction between bamboos, fire takes place and burns an entire forest. Similarly, in the greater forest of worldly transaction, the fire of war takes place because of the violent passion of the conditioned souls illusioned by the external energy. Such a worldly fire can be extinguished only by the water of the mercy cloud of saints, just as a forest fire can be extinguished only by rains falling from a cloud."

        "purport": " Human society is divided into four social orders of life and four spiritual divisions, applying to each and every individual person. This system is called var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma and has already been discussed in many places in this great literature. The sages, or persons who completely devoted themselves to the spiritual upliftment of the entire human society, were known as dvija-deva, the best amongst the twice-born. The denizens of superior planets, from the moon planet and upwards, were known as devas. Both the dvija-devas and the devas always establish temples of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in His various forms, such as Govinda, Madhus\u016bdana, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, M\u0101dhava, Ke\u015bava, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Padman\u0101bha, P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi and many others. The Lord expands Himself in innumerable forms, but all of them are nondifferent from one another. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has four hands, and each hand holds a particular item \u2014 either a conchshell, wheel, club or lotus flower. Of these four emblems, the cakra, or wheel, is the chief. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the original Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form, has only one emblem, namely the wheel, and therefore He is sometimes called the Cakr\u012b. The Lord\u2019s cakra is the symbol of the power by which the Lord controls the whole manifestation. The tops of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u temples are marked with the symbol of the wheel so that people may have the chance to see the symbol from a very long distance and at once remember Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The purpose of building very high temples is to give people a chance to see them from a distant place. This system is carried on in India whenever a new temple is constructed, and it appears that it is coming down from a time before recorded history. The foolish propaganda by atheists that temples were constructed only in later days is refuted here because Vidura visited these temples at least five thousand years ago, and the temples of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u were in existence long, long before Vidura visited them. The great sages and demigods never established statues of men or demigods, but they established temples of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u for the benefit of common men, to raise them to the platform of God consciousness."

From the very beginning of His appearance, He was at Mathur\u0101 in the house of His maternal uncle Ka\u1e41sa, and He was reared by His foster father Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. There are still many devotees of the Lord lingering there in ecstasy in search of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His childhood associates, the gop\u012bs. It is not that such devotees meet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a face to face in that tract of land, but a devotee\u2019s eagerly searching after K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is as good as his seeing Him personally. How this is so cannot be explained, but it is factually realized by those who are pure devotees of the Lord. Philosophically, one can understand that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His remembrance are on the absolute plane and that the very idea of searching for Him at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in pure God consciousness gives more pleasure to the devotee than seeing Him face to face. Such devotees of the Lord see Him face to face at every moment, as confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38): \u201cThose who are in ecstasy of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ay\u0101masundara [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], see Him always in their hearts due to love and devotional service rendered to the Lord.\u201d Both Vidura and Uddhava were such elevated devotees, and therefore they both came to the bank of the Yamun\u0101 and met each other."

Vidura\u2019s brother P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du was Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s uncle, and Uddhava was a cousin to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to social custom, therefore, Vidura was to be respected by Uddhava on the level of his father. Uddhava was a great scholar in logic, and he was known to be a son or disciple of B\u1e5bhaspati, the greatly learned priest and spiritual master of the demigods. Vidura asked Uddhava about the welfare of his relatives, although he already knew that they were no longer in the world. This inquiry appears to be very queer, but \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b states that the news was shocking to Vidura, who therefore inquired again due to great curiosity. Thus his inquiry was psychological and not practical."

        "purport": " The destination of transcendence is to become the personal associate of the Personality of Godhead, who is known as adhok\u1e63aja, He who is beyond the reach of the senses. The renouncers of the world, the sanny\u0101s\u012bs, give up all worldly connections, namely family, wife, children, friends, home, wealth \u2014 everything \u2014 to attain the transcendental bliss of Brahman happiness. But adhok\u1e63aja happiness is beyond Brahman happiness. The empiric philosophers enjoy a transcendental quality of bliss by philosophical speculation on the Supreme Truth, but beyond that pleasure is the pleasure enjoyed by Brahman in His eternal form of the Personality of Godhead. Brahman bliss is enjoyed by living entities after liberation from material bondage. But Parabrahman, the Personality of Godhead, enjoys eternally a bliss of His own potency, which is called the hl\u0101din\u012b potency. The empiric philosopher who studies Brahman by negation of the external features has not yet learned the quality of the hl\u0101din\u012b potency of Brahman. Out of many potencies of the Omnipotent, there are three features of His internal potency \u2014 namely sa\u1e41vit, sandhin\u012b and hl\u0101din\u012b. And in spite of their strict adherence to the principles of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, dhy\u0101na, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101 and pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, the great yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are unable to enter into the internal potency of the Lord. This internal potency is, however, easily realized by the devotees of the Lord by dint of devotional service. Yuyudh\u0101na achieved this stage of life, just as he achieved expert knowledge in military science from Arjuna. Thus his life was successful to the fullest extent from both the material and spiritual angles of vision. That is the way of devotional service to the Lord."

Vidura\u2019s inquiry was about the youngest brothers of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, namely Nakula and Sahadeva. These twin brothers were sons of M\u0101dr\u012b, the stepmother of the other P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas.

The five brothers are known in the world as regular brothers. The three elder P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas took care of the younger brothers, just as the eyelid takes care of the eye.

        "purport": " A faithful wife cannot live without her lord, the husband, and therefore all widows used to voluntarily embrace the burning fire which consumed the dead husband. This system was very common in India because all the wives were chaste and faithful to their husbands. Later on, with the advent of the Age of Kali, the wives gradually began to be less adherent to their husbands, and the voluntary embrace of the fire by the widows became a thing of the past. Very recently the system was abolished, since the voluntary system had become a forcible social custom. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du died, both his wives, namely Kunt\u012b and M\u0101dr\u012b, were prepared to embrace the fire, but M\u0101dr\u012b requested Kunt\u012b to live for the sake of the younger children, the five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. This was agreed upon by Kunt\u012b at the added request of Vy\u0101sadeva. In spite of her great bereavement, Kunt\u012b decided to live, not to enjoy life in the absence of her husband, but only to give protection to the children. This incident is referred to here by Vidura because he knew all the facts about his sister-in-law Kunt\u012bdev\u012b. It is understood that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du was a great warrior and that he alone, with the help of bow and arrow, could conquer the world\u2019s four directions. In the absence of such a husband, it was almost impossible for Kunt\u012b to live on even as a widow, but she had to do it for the sake of the five children."

        "purport": " Although he was the brother of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, Vidura was completely different. By the grace of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he was not foolish like his brother, and thus his brother\u2019s association could not influence him. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and his materialistic sons wanted to falsely lord it over the world by dint of their own strength. The Lord encouraged them in this, and thus they became more and more bewildered. But Vidura wanted to achieve sincere devotional service of the Lord and therefore became a soul absolutely surrendered to the Absolute Personality of Godhead. He could realize this in the progress of his pilgrim\u2019s journey, and thus he was freed from all doubts. He was not at all sorry to be bereft of his hearth and home because he now had experience that dependence on the mercy of the Lord is a greater freedom than so-called freedom at home. A person should not be in the renounced order of life unless he is firmly convinced of being protected by the Lord. This stage of life is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as abhaya\u1e41 sattva-sa\u1e41\u015buddhi\u1e25. Every living entity is factually completely dependent on the mercy of the Lord, but unless one is in the pure state of existence, he cannot be established in this position. This stage of dependence is called sattva-sa\u1e41\u015buddhi\u1e25, or purification of one\u2019s existence. The result of such purification is exhibited in fearlessness. A devotee of the Lord, who is called n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-para, is never afraid of anything because he is always aware of the fact that the Lord protects him in all circumstances. With this conviction, Vidura traveled alone, and he was not seen or recognized by any friend or foe. Thus he enjoyed freedom of life without obligation to the many duties of the world. When Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was personally present in the mortal world in His eternal, blissful form of \u015ay\u0101masundara, those who were not pure devotees of the Lord could not recognize Him or know His glories.

        "purport": " As declared in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord appears in the mortal world to execute His much-needed mission of killing the miscreants and giving protection to the suffering faithful. In spite of that mission, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tolerated the insult to Draupad\u012b by the Kurus and the injustices perpetrated against the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, as well as insults to Himself. The question may be raised, \u201cWhy did He tolerate such injustices and insults in His presence? Why did He not chastise the Kurus immediately?\u201d When Draupad\u012b was insulted in the assembly by the Kurus by their attempt to see her naked in the presence of all, the Lord protected Draupad\u012b by supplying an unlimited length of clothing. But He did not chastise the insulting party immediately. This silence of the Lord did not mean, however, that He excused the offenses of the Kurus. There were many other kings on earth who had become very proud of three kinds of possessions \u2014 wealth, education and followers \u2014 and they were constantly agitating the earth by movements of military strength. The Lord was just waiting to get them together on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra and kill them all at one time, just to make a shortcut in His killing mission. Godless kings or heads of state, when puffed up by advancement of material wealth, education and increase of population, always make a show of military strength and give trouble to the innocent. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was personally present, there were many such kings all over the world, and He thus arranged for the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. In His manifestation of vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, the Lord expressed His mission of killing as follows: \u201cI have willingly descended to the earth in My capacity of inexorable Time in order to decrease the unwanted population. I shall finish all those who have assembled here except you, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. This killing does not wait for you to take part in it. It is already arranged: all will be killed by Me. If you want to become famous as the hero of the battlefield and thus enjoy the booty of war, then, O Savyas\u0101c\u012b, just become the immediate cause of this killing and thus take the credit. I have already killed all the great warriors \u2014 Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Dro\u1e47a, Jayadratha, Kar\u1e47a and many other great generals. Do not worry. Fight the battle and be famous as a great hero.\u201d (Bg. 11.32-34) The Lord always wants to see His devotee as the hero of some episode which He Himself performs. He wanted to see His devotee and friend Arjuna as the hero of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and thus He waited for all the miscreants of the world to assemble. That, and nothing else, is the explanation of His waiting."

        "translation": "The appearance of the Lord is manifested for the annihilation of the upstarts. His activities are transcendental and are enacted for the understanding of all persons. Otherwise, since the Lord is transcendental to all material modes, what purpose could He serve by coming to earth?",
        "purport": " \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25 (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.1): the form of the Lord is eternal, blissful and all-satisfying. His so-called birth is therefore an appearance only, like the birth of the sun on the horizon. His birth does not, like that of the living entities, take place under the influence of material nature and the bondage of the reactions of past deeds. His works and activities are independent pastimes and are not subject to the reactions of material nature. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.14) it is said: The law of karma enacted by the Supreme Lord for the living entities cannot be applicable to Him, nor has the Lord any desire to improve Himself by activities like those of ordinary living beings. Ordinary living beings work for the improvement of their conditional lives. But the Lord is already full of all opulence, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation. Why should He desire improvement? No one can excel Him in any opulence, and therefore the desire for improvement is absolutely useless for Him. One should always discriminate between the activities of the Lord and those of ordinary living beings. Thus one may come to the right conclusion regarding the Lord\u2019s transcendental position. One who can come to the conclusion of the Lord\u2019s transcendence can become a devotee of the Lord and can at once be free from all reactions of past deeds. It is said, karm\u0101\u1e47i nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bh\u0101j\u0101m: the Lord minimizes or nullifies the reactionary influence of the devotee\u2019s past deeds. (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.54) The activities of the Lord are to be accepted and relished by all living entities. His activities are to attract the ordinary man towards the Lord. The Lord always acts in favor of the devotees, and therefore ordinary men who are fruitive actors or seekers of salvation may be attracted to the Lord when He acts as protector of the devotees. The fruitive actors can attain their goals by devotional service, and the salvationists can also attain their goal in life by devotional service to the Lord. The devotees do not want the fruitive results of their work, nor do they want any kind of salvation. They relish the glorious superhuman activities of the Lord, such as His lifting Govardhana Hill and His killing the demon P\u016btan\u0101 in infancy. His activities are enacted to attract all kinds of men \u2014 karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and bhaktas. Because He is transcendental to all laws of karma, there is no possibility of His accepting a form of m\u0101y\u0101 as is forced on the ordinary living entities who are bound by the actions and reactions of their own deeds. The secondary purpose of His appearance is to annihilate the upstart asuras and to stop the nonsense of atheistic propaganda by less intelligent persons. By the Lord\u2019s causeless mercy, the asuras who are killed personally by the Personality of Godhead get salvation. The meaningful appearance of the Lord is always distinct from ordinary birth. Even the pure devotees have no connection with the material body, and certainly the Lord, who appears as He is, in His sac-cid-\u0101nanda form, is not limited by a material form."

He is unborn, and yet He appears by His causeless mercy upon the surrendered rulers of all parts of the universe. Only for their interest did He appear in the family of His unalloyed devotees the Yadus.",
        "purport": " There are innumerable rulers all over the universe in different varieties of planets: the sun-god in the sun planet, the moon-god in the moon planet, Indra in the heavenly planet, V\u0101yu, Varu\u1e47a, and those in the Brahmaloka planet, where Lord Brahm\u0101 is living. All are obedient servants of the Lord. Whenever there is any trouble in the administration of the innumerable planets in different universes, the rulers pray for an appearance, and the Lord appears. The Bh\u0101gavatam (1.3.28) has already confirmed this in the following verse: In every millennium, whenever there is any trouble for the obedient rulers, the Lord appears. He also appears for the sake of His pure unalloyed devotees. The surrendered rulers and the pure devotees are always strictly under the control of the Lord, and they are never disobedient to the desires of the Lord. The Lord is therefore always attentive to them. The purpose of pilgrimages is to remember the Lord constantly, and therefore the Lord is known as t\u012brtha-k\u012brti. The purpose of going to a place of pilgrimage is to get the chance to glorify the Lord. Even today, although times have changed, there are still pilgrimage sites in India. For example, in Mathur\u0101 and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where we had a chance to stay, people are awake from early in the morning at 4 A.M. up until nighttime and are constantly engaged, some way or other, in chanting the holy glories of the Lord. The beauty of such a pilgrimage site is that automatically one remembers the holy glories of the Lord. His name, fame, quality, form, pastimes and entourage are all identical to the Lord, and therefore chanting the glories of the Lord invokes the personal presence of the Lord. Any time or anywhere pure devotees meet and chant the glories of the Lord, the Lord is present without any doubt. It is said by the Lord Himself that He always stays where His pure devotees chant His glories."
