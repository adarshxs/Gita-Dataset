        "purport": " The entire social structure of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama is a cooperative system meant to uplift all to the highest platform of spiritual realization. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as are intended to be protected by the k\u1e63atriyas, and the k\u1e63atriyas also are intended to be enlightened by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. When the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas cooperate nicely, the other subordinate divisions, the vai\u015byas, or mercantile people, and the \u015b\u016bdras, or laborer class, automatically flourish. The entire elaborate system of Vedic society was therefore based on the importance of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas. The Lord is the real protector, but He is unattached to the affairs of protection. He creates br\u0101hma\u1e47as for the protection of the k\u1e63atriyas, and k\u1e63atriyas for the protection of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. He remains aloof from all activities; therefore, He is called nirvik\u0101ra, \u201cwithout activity.\u201d He has nothing to do. He is so great that He does not perform action personally, but His energies act. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas, and anything that we see, are different energies acting upon one another. Although individual souls are all different, the Superself, or Supersoul, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Individually one\u2019s self may differ from others in certain qualities and may engage in different activities, such as those of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya or vai\u015bya, but when there is complete cooperation among different individual souls, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul, Param\u0101tm\u0101, being one in every individual soul, is pleased and gives them all protection. As stated before, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are produced from the mouth of the Lord, and the k\u1e63atriyas are produced from the chest or arms of the Lord. If the different castes or social sections, although apparently differently occupied in different activities, nevertheless act in full cooperation, then the Lord is pleased. This is the idea of the institution of four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas. If the members of different \u0101\u015bramas and var\u1e47as cooperate fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then society is well protected by the Lord, without doubt. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated that the Lord is the proprietor of all different bodies. The individual soul is the proprietor of his individual body, but the Lord clearly states, \u201cMy dear Bh\u0101rata, you must know that I am also k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a.\u201d K\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a means \u201cthe knower or proprietor of the body.\u201d The individual soul is the proprietor of the individual body, but the Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the proprietor of all bodies everywhere. He is the proprietor not only of human bodies but of birds, beasts and all other entities, not only on this planet but on other planets also. He is the supreme proprietor; therefore He does not become divided by protecting the different individual souls. He remains one and the same. That the sun appears on top of everyone\u2019s head when at the meridian does not imply that the sun becomes divided. One man thinks that the sun is on his head only, whereas five thousand miles away another man is thinking that the sun is only on his head. Similarly, the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is one, but He appears to individually oversee each individual soul. This does not mean that the individual soul and the Supersoul are one. They are one in quality, as spirit soul, but the individual soul and Supersoul are different."

Lord Caitanya says that one should always try to associate with saintly persons because if one establishes a proper association with a saintly person, even for a moment, one attains all perfection. Somehow or other, if one meets a saintly person and achieves his favor, then the entire mission of one\u2019s human life is fulfilled. In our personal experience we have actual proof of this statement of Manu. Once we had the opportunity to meet Vi\u1e63\u1e47up\u0101da \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bmad Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and on first sight he requested this humble self to preach his message in the Western countries. There was no preparation for this, but somehow or other he desired it, and by his grace we are now engaged in executing his order, which has given us a transcendental occupation and has saved and liberated us from the occupation of material activities. Thus it is actually a fact that if one meets a saintly person completely engaged in transcendental duties and achieves his favor, then one\u2019s life mission becomes complete. What is not possible to achieve in thousands of lives can be achieved in one moment if there is an opportunity to meet a saintly person. It is therefore enjoined in Vedic literature that one should always try to associate with saintly persons and try to disassociate oneself from the common man, because by one word of a saintly person one can be liberated from material entanglement. A saintly person has the power, because of his spiritual advancement, to give immediate liberation to the conditioned soul. Here Manu admits that all his doubts are now over because Kardama has very kindly described the different duties of individual souls."

        "purport": " The perfection of transcendental life can be achieved simply by touching the holy dust of the lotus feet of a holy man. In the Bh\u0101gavatam it is said, mahat-p\u0101da-rajo-\u2019bhi\u1e63ekam, which means to be blessed by the holy dust of the lotus feet of a mahat, a great devotee. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, mah\u0101tm\u0101nas tu: those who are great souls are under the spell of spiritual energy, and their symptom is that they fully engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for the service of the Lord. Therefore they are called mahat. Unless one is fortunate enough to have the dust of the lotus feet of a mah\u0101tm\u0101 on one\u2019s head, there is no possibility of perfection in spiritual life. The parampar\u0101 system of disciplic succession is very important as a means of spiritual success. One becomes a mahat by the grace of his mahat spiritual master. If one takes shelter of the lotus feet of a great soul, there is every possibility of one\u2019s also becoming a great soul. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Rah\u016bga\u1e47a asked Ja\u1e0da Bharata about his wonderful achievement of spiritual success, he replied to the King that spiritual success is not possible simply by following the rituals of religion or simply by converting oneself into a sanny\u0101s\u012b or offering sacrifices as recommended in the scriptures. These methods are undoubtedly helpful for spiritual realization, but the real effect is brought about by the grace of a mah\u0101tm\u0101. In Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura\u2019s eight stanzas of prayer to the spiritual master, it is clearly stated that simply by satisfying the spiritual master one can achieve the supreme success in life, and in spite of executing all ritualistic performances, if one cannot satisfy the spiritual master, one has no access to spiritual perfection. Here the word ak\u1e5bt\u0101tman\u0101m is very significant. \u0100tm\u0101 means \u201cbody,\u201d \u201csoul,\u201d or \u201cmind,\u201d and ak\u1e5bt\u0101tm\u0101 means the common man, who cannot control the senses or the mind. Because the common man is unable to control the senses and the mind, it is his duty to seek the shelter of a great soul or a great devotee of the Lord and just try to please him. That will make his life perfect. A common man cannot rise to the topmost stage of spiritual perfection simply by following the rituals and religious principles. He has to take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and work under his direction faithfully and sincerely; then he becomes perfect, without a doubt."

        "translation": "I have fortunately been instructed by you, and thus great favor has been bestowed upon me. I thank God that I have listened with open ears to your pure words.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has given directions, in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu, on how to accept a bona fide spiritual master and how to deal with him. First, the desiring candidate must find a bona fide spiritual master, and then he must very eagerly receive instructions from him and execute them. This is reciprocal service. A bona fide spiritual master or saintly person always desires to elevate a common man who comes to him. Because everyone is under the delusion of m\u0101y\u0101 and is forgetful of his prime duty, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, a saintly person always desires that everyone become a saintly person. It is the function of a saintly person to invoke K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in every forgetful common man. Manu said that since he was advised and instructed by Kardama Muni, he was very much favored. He considered himself lucky to receive the message by aural reception. It is especially mentioned here that one should be very inquisitive to hear with open ears from the authorized source of the bona fide spiritual master. How is one to receive? One should receive the transcendental message by aural reception. The word kar\u1e47a-randhrai\u1e25 means \u201cthrough the holes of the ears.\u201d The favor of the spiritual master is not received through any other part of the body but the ears. This does not mean, however, that the spiritual master gives a particular type of mantra through the ears in exchange for some dollars and if the man meditates on that he achieves perfection and becomes God within six months. Such reception through the ears is bogus. The real fact is that a bona fide spiritual master knows the nature of a particular man and what sort of duties he can perform in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and he instructs him in that way. He instructs him through the ear, not privately, but publicly. \u201cYou are fit for such and such work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. You can act in this way.\u201d One person is advised to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by working in the Deities\u2019 room, another is advised to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by performing editorial work, another is advised to do preaching work, and another is advised to carry out K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the cooking department. There are different departments of activity in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and a spiritual master, knowing the particular ability of a particular man, trains him in such a way that by his tendency to act he becomes perfect. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 makes it clear that one can attain the highest perfection of spiritual life simply by offering service according to his ability, just as Arjuna served K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by his ability in the military art. Arjuna offered his service fully as a military man, and he became perfect. Similarly, an artist can attain perfection simply by performing artistic work under the direction of the spiritual master. If one is a literary man, he can write articles and poetry for the service of the Lord under the direction of the spiritual master. One has to receive the message of the spiritual master regarding how to act in one\u2019s capacity, for the spiritual master is expert in giving such instructions. This combination, the instruction of the spiritual master and the faithful execution of the instruction by the disciple, makes the entire process perfect. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura describes in his explanation of the verse in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101 buddhi\u1e25, that one who wants to be certain to achieve spiritual success must take the instruction from the spiritual master as to what his particular function is. He should faithfully try to execute that particular instruction and should consider that his life and soul. The faithful execution of the instruction which he receives from the spiritual master is the only duty of a disciple, and that will bring him perfection. One should be very careful to receive the message from the spiritual master through the ears and execute it faithfully. That will make one\u2019s life successful."

The purport is that a wife should not only be equal to her husband in age, character and qualities, but must be helpful to him in his household duties. The household duty of a man is not to satisfy his sense gratification, but to remain with a wife and children and at the same time attain advancement in spiritual life. One who does not do so is not a householder but a g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b. Two words are used in Sanskrit literature; one is g\u1e5bhastha, and the other is g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b. The difference between g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b and g\u1e5bhastha is that g\u1e5bhastha is also an \u0101\u015brama, or spiritual order, but if one simply satisfies his senses as a householder, then he is a g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b. For a g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b, to accept a wife means to satisfy the senses, but for a g\u1e5bhastha a qualified wife is an assistant in every respect for advancement in spiritual activities. It is the duty of the wife to take charge of household affairs and not to compete with the husband. A wife is meant to help, but she cannot help her husband unless he is completely equal to her in age, character and quality."

Do not reject the offer, or else, because you are in need of a wife, you will have to ask for such a wife from someone else, who may not behave with you so well. In that case your position will be humbled.\u201d Another feature of this incident is that Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu was the emperor, but he went to offer his qualified daughter to a poor br\u0101hma\u1e47a.

That is a great consideration because female psychology dictates that when a woman offers her heart to a man for the first time, it is very difficult for her to take it back. Also, she had not married before; she was a virgin girl. All these considerations convinced Kardama Muni to accept her. Therefore he said, \u201cYes, I shall accept your daughter under religious regulations of marriage.\u201d There are different kinds of marriages, of which the first-class marriage is held by inviting a suitable bridegroom for the daughter and giving her in charity, well dressed and well decorated with ornaments, along with a dowry according to the means of the father. There are other kinds of marriage, such as g\u0101ndharva marriage and marriage by love, which are also accepted as marriage. Even if one is forcibly kidnapped and later on accepted as a wife, that is also accepted.

        "purport": " Kardama Muni wanted to marry Devah\u016bti in the recognized manner of marriage prescribed in the scriptures. As stated in the Vedic scriptures, the first-class process is to call the bridegroom to the home of the bride and hand her to him in charity with a dowry of necessary ornaments, gold, furniture and other household paraphernalia. This form of marriage is prevalent among higher-class Hindus even today and is declared in the \u015b\u0101stras to confer great religious merit on the bride\u2019s father. To give a daughter in charity to a suitable son-in-law is considered to be one of the pious activities of a householder. There are eight forms of marriage mentioned in the scripture Manu-sm\u1e5bti, but only one process of marriage, br\u0101hma or r\u0101jasika marriage, is now current. Other kinds of marriage \u2014 by love, by exchange of garlands or by kidnapping the bride \u2014 are now forbidden in this Kali age. Formerly, at their pleasure k\u1e63atriyas would kidnap a princess from another royal house and there would be a fight between the k\u1e63atriya and the girl\u2019s family; then, if the kidnapper was the winner, the girl would be offered to him for marriage. Even K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a married Rukmi\u1e47\u012b by that process, and some of His sons and grandsons also married by kidnapping. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grandsons kidnapped Duryodhana\u2019s daughter, which caused a fight between the Kuru and Yadu families. Afterward, an adjustment was made by the elderly members of the Kuru family. Such marriages were current in bygone ages, but at the present moment they are impossible because the strict principles of k\u1e63atriya life have practically been abolished. Since India has become dependent on foreign countries, the particular influences of her social orders have been lost; now, according to the scriptures, everyone is a \u015b\u016bdra. The so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas have forgotten their traditional activities, and in the absence of these activities they are called \u015b\u016bdras. It is said in the scriptures, kalau \u015b\u016bdra-sambhava\u1e25. In the Age of Kali everyone will be like \u015b\u016bdras. The traditional social customs are not followed in this age, although formerly they were followed strictly."

The vision was so distinct that the Gandharva Vi\u015bv\u0101vasu was bewildered by her beauty and by hearing the sound of her ankle bangles, and being captivated by the sound and beauty, he fell down.

        "purport": " Kardama Muni expressed his desire for a very beautiful wife to Emperor Sv\u0101yambhuva and accepted the Emperor\u2019s daughter for marriage. Kardama Muni was in the hermitage practicing complete celibacy as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, and although he had the desire to marry, he did not want to be a householder for the whole span of his life because he was conversant with the Vedic principles of human life. According to Vedic principles, the first part of life should be utilized in brahmacarya for the development of character and spiritual qualities. In the next part of life, one may accept a wife and beget children, but one should not beget children like cats and dogs. Kardama Muni desired to beget a child who would be a ray of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should beget a child who can perform the duties of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, otherwise there is no need to produce children. There are two kinds of children born of good fathers: one is educated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that he can be delivered from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 in that very life, and the other is a ray of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and teaches the world the ultimate goal of life. As will be described in later chapters, Kardama Muni begot such a child \u2014 Kapila, the incarnation of the Personality of Godhead who enunciated the philosophy of S\u0101\u1e45khya. Great householders pray to God to send His representative so that there may be an auspicious movement in human society. This is one reason to beget a child. Another reason is that a highly enlightened parent can train a child in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that the child will not have to come back again to this miserable world. Parents should see to it that the child born of them does not enter the womb of a mother again. Unless one can train a child for liberation in that life, there is no need to marry or produce children. If human society produces children like cats and dogs for the disturbance of social order, then the world becomes hellish, as it has in this Age of Kali. In this age, neither parents nor their children are trained; both are animalistic and simply eat, sleep, mate, defend, and gratify their senses. This disorder in social life cannot bring peace to human society. Kardama Muni explains beforehand that he would not associate with the girl Devah\u016bti for the whole duration of his life. He would simply associate with her until she had a child. In other words, sex life should be utilized only to produce a nice child, not for any other purpose. Human life is especially meant for complete devotion to the service of the Lord. That is the philosophy of Lord Caitanya. After fulfilling his responsibility to produce a nice child, one should take sanny\u0101sa and engage in the perfectional paramaha\u1e41sa stage. Paramaha\u1e41sa refers to the most highly elevated perfectional stage of life. There are four stages within sanny\u0101sa life, and paramaha\u1e41sa is the highest order. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is called the paramaha\u1e41sa-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the treatise for the highest class of human beings. The paramaha\u1e41sa is free from envy. In other stages, even in the householder stage of life, there is competition and envy, but since the activities of the human being in the paramaha\u1e41sa stage are completely engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or devotional service, there is no scope for envy. In the same order as Kardama Muni, about one hundred years ago, \u1e6ch\u0101kura Bhaktivinoda also wanted to beget a child who could preach the philosophy and teachings of Lord Caitanya to the fullest extent. By his prayers to the Lord he had as his child Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who at the present moment is preaching the philosophy of Lord Caitanya throughout the entire world through his bona fide disciples."

        "purport": " Kardama Muni was ordered by his father, Praj\u0101pati, to produce children. In the beginning of creation the Praj\u0101patis were meant to produce the large population which was to reside in the planets of the gigantic universe. But Kardama Muni said that although his father was Praj\u0101pati, who desired him to produce children, actually his origin was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, because Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the origin of everything; He is the actual creator of this universe, He is the actual maintainer, and when everything is annihilated, it rests in Him only. That is the conclusion of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. For creation, maintenance and annihilation there are the three deities Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Mahe\u015bvara (\u015aiva), but Brahm\u0101 and Mahe\u015bvara are qualitative expansions of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the central figure. Therefore He takes charge of maintenance. No one can maintain the whole creation but Him. There are innumerable entities, and they have innumerable demands; no one but Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can fulfill the innumerable demands of all the innumerable living entities. Brahm\u0101 is ordered to create, and \u015aiva is ordered to annihilate. The middle function, maintenance, is taken charge of by Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Kardama Muni knew very well, by his power in progressive spiritual life, that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Personality of Godhead, was his worshipable Deity. Whatever Vi\u1e63\u1e47u desired was his duty, and nothing else. He was not prepared to beget a number of children. He would beget only one child, who would help the mission of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, whenever there is a discrepancy in the discharge of religious principles, the Lord descends to the surface of the earth to protect religious principles and to annihilate the miscreants. Marrying and begetting a child is considered to liquidate one\u2019s debts to the family in which one is born. There are many debts which are imposed upon a child just after his birth. There are debts to the family in which one is born, debts to the demigods, debts to the Pit\u0101s, debts to the \u1e5b\u1e63is, etc. But if someone engages only in the service of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, who is actually worshipable, then even without trying to liquidate other debts, one becomes free from all obligations. Kardama Muni preferred to devote his life as a servant of the Lord in paramaha\u1e41sa knowledge and to beget a child only for that purpose, not to beget numberless children to fill up the vacancies in the universe."

The bride, Devah\u016bti, was very richly dressed with ornaments and clothing. In this way Kardama Muni was married with full opulence to a qualified wife and was endowed with the necessary paraphernalia for household life. In the Vedic way of marriage such a dowry is still given to the bridegroom by the father of the bride; even in poverty-stricken India there are marriages where hundreds and thousands of rupees are spent for a dowry. The dowry system is not illegal, as some have tried to prove. The dowry is a gift given to the daughter by the father to show good will, and it is compulsory. In rare cases where the father is completely unable to give a dowry, it is enjoined that he must at least give a fruit and a flower. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, God can also be pleased even by a fruit and a flower. When there is financial inability and no question of accumulating a dowry by another means, one can give a fruit and flower for the satisfaction of the bridegroom."

A father sometimes addresses his daughter in affection as \u201cmother\u201d and sometimes as \u201cmy darling.\u201d The feeling of separation occurs because until the daughter is married she remains the daughter of the father, but after her marriage she is no longer claimed as a daughter in the family; she must go to the husband\u2019s house, for after marriage she becomes the property of the husband. According to Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, a woman is never independent. She must remain the property of the father while she is not married, and she must remain the property of the husband until she is elderly and has grown-up children of her own. In old age, when the husband has taken sanny\u0101sa and left home, she remains the property of the sons. A woman is always dependent, either upon the father, husband or elderly sons. That will be exhibited in the life of Devah\u016bti. Devah\u016bti\u2019s father handed over responsibility for her to the husband, Kardama Muni, and in the same way, Kardama Muni also left home, giving the responsibility to his son, Kapiladeva.

Similarly, the descendants of Manu, or human beings, especially those who are situated in a well-to-do condition, must consider that whatever riches they have are gifts from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those riches should be utilized for the service of the Lord in sacrifices performed to please Him. That is the way of utilizing wealth and opulence. No one can achieve wealth, opulence, good birth, a beautiful body or nice education without the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, those who are in possession of such valuable facilities must acknowledge their gratefulness to the Lord by worshiping Him and offering what they have received from Him. When such acknowledgment is given, either by a family, nation or society, their abode becomes almost like Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, and it becomes free from the operation of the threefold miseries of this material world. In the modern age the mission of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is for everyone to acknowledge the supremacy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; whatever one has in his possession must be considered a gift by the grace of the Lord.

The miseries of material existence cannot affect the status of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is not that the miseries of the material world completely vanish when one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but for one who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious the miseries of material existence have no effect. We cannot stop the miseries of the material atmosphere, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the antiseptic method to protect us from being affected by the miseries of material existence. For a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, both living in heaven and living in hell are equal. How Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu created an atmosphere wherein he was not affected by material miseries is explained in the following verses."

        "translation": "Emperor Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu enjoyed life with his wife and subjects and fulfilled his desires without being disturbed by unwanted principles contrary to the process of religion. Celestial musicians and their wives sang in chorus about the pure reputation of the Emperor, and early in the morning, every day, he used to listen to the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with a loving heart.",
        "purport": " Human society is actually meant for realization of perfection in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There is no restriction against living with a wife and children, but life should be so conducted that one may not go against the principles of religion, economic development, regulated sense enjoyment and, ultimately, liberation from material existence. The Vedic principles are designed in such a way that the conditioned souls who have come to this material existence may be guided in fulfilling their material desires and at the same time be liberated and go back to Godhead, back home. It is understood that Emperor Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu enjoyed his household life by following these principles. It is stated here that early in the morning there were musicians who used to sing with musical instruments about the glories of the Lord, and the Emperor, with his family, personally used to hear about the pastimes of the Supreme Person. This custom is still prevalent in India in some of the royal families and temples. Professional musicians sing with \u015bahn\u0101\u012bs, and the sleeping members of the house gradually get up from their beds in a pleasing atmosphere. During bedtime also the singers sing songs in relationship with the pastimes of the Lord, with \u015bahn\u0101\u012b accompaniment, and the householders gradually fall asleep remembering the glories of the Lord. In every house, in addition to the singing program, there is an arrangement for Bh\u0101gavatam lectures in the evening; family members sit down, hold Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a k\u012brtana, hear narrations from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and enjoy music before going to bed. The atmosphere created by this sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement lives in their hearts, and while sleeping they also dream of the singing and glorification of the Lord. In such a way, perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can be attained. This practice is very old, as learned from this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam; millions of years ago, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu used to avail himself of this opportunity to live householder life in the peace and prosperity of a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness atmosphere. As far as temples are concerned, in each and every royal palace or rich man\u2019s house, inevitably there is a nice temple, and the members of the household rise early in the morning and go to the temple to see the ma\u1e45gala-\u0101rati ceremony. The ma\u1e45gala-\u0101rati ceremony is the first worship of the morning. In the \u0101rati ceremony a light is offered in circles before the Deities, as are a conchshell and flowers and a fan. The Lord is supposed to rise early in the morning and take some light refreshment and give audience to the devotees. The devotees then go back to the house or sing the glories of the Lord in the temple. The early morning ceremony still takes place in Indian temples and palaces. Temples are meant for the assembly of the general public. Temples within palaces are especially for the royal families, but in many of these palace temples the public is also allowed to visit. The temple of the King of Jaipur is situated within the palace, but the public is allowed to assemble; if one goes there, he will see that the temple is always crowded with at least five hundred devotees. After the ma\u1e45gala-\u0101rati ceremony they sit down together and sing the glories of the Lord with musical instruments and thus enjoy life. Temple worship by the royal family is also mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, where it is stated that those who fail to achieve success in the bhakti-yoga principles within one life are given a chance to take birth in the next life in a family of rich men or in a royal family or family of learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as or devotees. If one gets the opportunity to take birth in these families, he can achieve the facilities of a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious atmosphere without difficulty. A child born in that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a atmosphere is sure to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The perfection which he failed to attain in his last life is again offered in this life, and he can make himself perfect without fail."

        "purport": " The kingly happiness of material enjoyment generally drags one to the lowest grade of life, namely degradation to animal life, because of unrestricted sense enjoyment. But Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu was considered as good as a saintly sage because the atmosphere created in his kingdom and home was completely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. The case is similar with the conditioned souls in general; they have come into this material life for sense gratification, but if they are able to create a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious atmosphere, as depicted here or as prescribed in revealed scriptures, by temple worship and household Deity worship, then in spite of their material enjoyment they can make advancement in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness without a doubt. At the present moment, modern civilization is too much attached to the material way of life, or sense gratification. Therefore, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement can give the people in general the best opportunity to utilize their human life in the midst of material enjoyment. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not stop them in their propensity for material enjoyment, but simply regulates their habits in the life of sense enjoyment.

The life of Emperor Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, however, was not tasteless; as he grew older, his life remained as fresh as in the beginning because of his continued K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

These destinations are sometimes described as the awakened, dreaming and unconscious stages. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the three destinations are described as the destinations of persons in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. It is stated in the G\u012bt\u0101 that those who are in the mode of goodness are promoted to better living conditions in higher planets, and those who are in the mode of passion remain within this material world on the earth or on heavenly planets, but those who are in the mode of ignorance are degraded to an animal life on planets where life is lower than human. But one who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is above these three modes of material nature. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that anyone who engages in devotional service to the Lord automatically becomes transcendental to the three destinations of material nature and is situated in the brahma-bh\u016bta, or self-realized, stage. Although Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, the ruler of this material world, appeared to be absorbed in material happiness, he was neither in the mode of goodness nor in the modes of passion or ignorance, but in the transcendental stage. Therefore one who fully engages in devotional service is always liberated. Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a great devotee of the Lord, stated, \u201cIf I have unflinching devotion to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then Mother Liberation is always engaged in my service. The complete perfection of material enjoyment, religion and economic development is at my command.\u201d People are after dharma, artha, k\u0101ma and mok\u1e63a. Generally they perform religious activities to achieve some material gain, and they engage in material activity for sense gratification. After being frustrated in material sense gratification, one wants to be liberated and become one with the Absolute Truth. These four principles form the transcendental path for the less intelligent. Those who are actually intelligent engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, not caring for these four principles of the transcendental method. They at once elevate themselves to the transcendental platform, which is above liberation. Liberation is not a very great achievement for a devotee, to say nothing of the results of ritualistic performances in religion, economic development or the materialistic life of sense gratification. Devotees do not care for these. They are situated always on the transcendental platform of the brahma-bh\u016bta stage of self-realization."
