Actually, Vidura was not interested in hearing the history of persons who merely engaged in sex life, but he was interested in the progeny of Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu because in that dynasty good devotee kings appeared who protected their subjects very carefully with spiritual knowledge. By hearing the history of their activities, therefore, one becomes more enlightened. An important word used in this connection is parama-sammata\u1e25, which indicates that the progeny created by Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu and his sons was approved of by great authorities. In other words, sex life for creating exemplary population is acceptable to all sages and authorities of Vedic scripture."

After self-realization there are eight further perfectional stages, which are called yoga-siddhis. The husband and wife, Kardama and Devah\u016bti, were advanced in yoga practice; the husband was a mah\u0101-yog\u012b, great mystic, and the wife was a yoga-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a, or one advanced in yoga. They united and produced children. Formerly, after making their lives perfect, great sages and saintly persons used to beget children, otherwise they strictly observed the rules and regulations of celibacy. Brahmacarya (following the rules and regulations of celibacy) is required for perfection of self-realization and mystic power. There is no recommendation in the Vedic scriptures that one can go on enjoying material sense gratification at one\u2019s whims, as one likes, and at the same time become a great meditator by paying a rascal some money."

        "translation": "During that period of penance, the sage Kardama, by worship through devotional service in trance, propitiated the Personality of Godhead, who is the quick bestower of all blessings upon those who flee to Him for protection.",
        "purport": " The significance of meditation is described here. Kardama Muni practiced mystic yoga meditation for ten thousand years just to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari. Therefore, whether one practices yoga or speculates and does research to find God, one\u2019s efforts must be mixed with the process of devotion. Without devotion, nothing can be perfect. The target of perfection and realization is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly said that one who constantly engages in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the topmost yog\u012b. The Personality of Godhead, Hari, also fulfills the desires of His surrendered devotee. One has to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, Hari, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in order to achieve real success. Devotional service, or engagement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the direct method, and all other methods, although recommended, are indirect. In this Age of Kali the direct method is especially more feasible than the indirect because people are short-living, their intelligence is poor, and they are poverty-stricken and embarrassed by so many miserable disturbances. Lord Caitanya, therefore, has given the greatest boon: in this age one simply has to chant the holy name of God to attain perfection in spiritual life. The words samprapede harim mean that in various ways Kardama Muni satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, by his devotional service. Devotional service is also expressed by the word kriy\u0101-yogena. Kardama Muni not only meditated but also engaged in devotional service; to attain perfection in yoga practice or meditation, one must act in devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. Remembering is meditation also. But who is to be remembered? One should remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Not only must one remember the Supreme Person; one must hear about the activities of the Lord and chant His glories. This information is in the authoritative scriptures. After engaging himself for ten thousand years in performing different types of devotional service, Kardama Muni attained the perfection of meditation, but that is not possible in this Age of Kali, wherein it is very difficult to live for as much as one hundred years. At the present moment, who will be successful in the rigid performance of the many yoga rules and regulations? Moreover, perfection is attained only by those who are surrendered souls. Where there is no mention of the Personality of Godhead, where is there surrender? And where there is no meditation upon the Personality of Godhead, where is the yoga practice? Unfortunately, people in this age, especially persons who are of a demoniac nature, want to be cheated. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead sends great cheaters who mislead them in the name of yoga and render their lives useless and doomed. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is therefore clearly stated (in the Sixteenth Chapter, verse 17) that rascals of self-made authority, being puffed up by illegally collected money, perform yoga without following the authoritative books. They are very proud of the money they have plundered from innocent persons who wanted to be cheated."

Sometimes the impersonalists recommend that one can arbitrarily concentrate one\u2019s mind on some form he imagines or which pleases him.

Kardama Muni did not discover any imaginary form of God, as alleged by rascals; he actually saw the eternal, blissful and transcendental form of the Lord."

By performance of yoga Kardama Muni actually saw the Supreme Lord as He is. There was no point in seeing an imagined form of God after practicing yoga for ten thousand years. The perfection of yoga, therefore, does not terminate in voidness or impersonalism; on the contrary, the perfection of yoga is attained when one actually sees the Personality of Godhead in His eternal form.

        "purport": " The realization of the personal form of the Lord is the highest perfectional stage of yoga. In the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, where yoga practice is described, this realization of the personal form of the Lord is called the perfection of yoga. After practicing the sitting postures and other regulative principles of the system, one finally reaches the stage of sam\u0101dhi, absorption in the Supreme. In the sam\u0101dhi stage one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His partial form as Param\u0101tm\u0101, or as He is. Sam\u0101dhi is described in authoritative yoga scriptures, such as the Pata\u00f1jali-s\u016btras, to be a transcendental pleasure. The yoga system described in the books of Pata\u00f1jali is authoritative, and the modern so-called yog\u012bs who have manufactured their own ways, not consulting the authorities, are simply ludicrous. The Pata\u00f1jali yoga system is called a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga. Sometimes impersonalists pollute the Pata\u00f1jali yoga system because they are monists. Pata\u00f1jali describes that the soul is transcendentally pleased when he meets the Supersoul and sees Him. If the existence of the Supersoul and the individual is admitted, then the impersonalist theory of monism is nullified. Therefore some impersonalists and void philosophers twist the Pata\u00f1jali system in their own way and pollute the whole yoga process. According to Pata\u00f1jali, when one becomes free from all material desires he attains his real, transcendental situation, and realization of that stage is called spiritual power. In material activities a person engages in the modes of material nature. The aspirations of such people are (1) to be religious, (2) to be economically enriched, (3) to be able to gratify the senses and, at last, (4) to become one with the Supreme. According to the monists, when a yog\u012b becomes one with the Supreme and loses his individual existence, he attains the highest stage, called kaivalya. But actually, the stage of realization of the Personality of Godhead is kaivalya. The oneness of understanding that the Supreme Lord is fully spiritual and that in full spiritual realization one can understand what He is \u2014 the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 is called kaivalya, or, in the language of Pata\u00f1jali, realization of spiritual power. His proposal is that when one is freed from material desires and fixed in spiritual realization of the self and the Superself, that is called cit-\u015bakti. In full spiritual realization there is a perception of spiritual happiness, and that happiness is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as the supreme happiness, which is beyond the material senses. Trance is described to be of two kinds, sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta and asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta, or mental speculation and self-realization. In sam\u0101dhi or asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta one can realize, by his spiritual senses, the spiritual form of the Lord. That is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. According to Pata\u00f1jali, when one is fixed in constant realization of the supreme form of the Lord, one has attained the perfectional stage, as attained by Kardama Muni. Unless one attains this stage of perfection \u2014 beyond the perfection of the preliminaries of the yoga system \u2014 there is no ultimate realization. There are eight perfections in the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga system. One who has attained them can become lighter than the lightest and greater than the greatest, and he can achieve whatever he likes. But even achieving such material success in yoga is not the perfection or the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is described here: Kardama Muni saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form. Devotional service begins with the relationship of the individual soul and the Supreme Soul, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees, and when one attains it there is no question of falling down. If, through the yoga system, one wants to attain the stage of seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, but is attracted instead to attainment of some material power, then he is detoured from proceeding further. Material enjoyment, as encouraged by bogus yog\u012bs, has nothing to do with the transcendental realization of spiritual happiness. Real devotees of bhakti-yoga accept only the material necessities of life absolutely needed to maintain the body and soul together; they refrain completely from all exaggerated material sense gratification. They are prepared to undergo all kinds of tribulation, provided they can make progress in the realization of the Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described here as the reservoir of all goodness and all pleasure. Unless one is situated in the mode of goodness, there is no real pleasure. Therefore when one\u2019s body, mind and activities are situated in the service of the Lord, one is on the highest perfectional stage of goodness. Kardama Muni says, \u201cYour Lordship is the reservoir of all that can be understood by the nomenclature of goodness, and by our experiencing You face to face, the perfection of sight has now been attained.\u201d These statements are the pure devotional situation; for a devotee, the perfection of the senses is to engage in the service of the Lord. The sense of sight, when engaged in seeing the beauty of the Lord, is perfected; the power to hear, when engaged in hearing the glories of the Lord, is perfected; the power to taste, when one enjoys by eating pras\u0101da, is perfected. When all the senses engage in relationship with the Personality of Godhead, one\u2019s perfection is technically called bhakti-yoga, which entails detaching the senses from material indulgence and attaching them to the service of the Lord. When one is freed from all designated conditional life and fully engages in the service of the Lord, one\u2019s service is called bhakti-yoga. Kardama Muni admits that seeing the Lord personally in bhakti-yoga is the perfection of sight. The exalted perfection of seeing the Lord is not exaggerated by Kardama Muni. He gives evidence that those who are actually elevated in yoga aspire in life after life to see this form of the Personality of Godhead. He was not a fictitious yog\u012b. Those who are actually on the advanced path aspire only to see the eternal form of the Lord."

Only persons deprived of their intelligence by the spell of the deluding energy will worship those feet with a view to attain the trivial and momentary pleasures of the senses, which even persons rotting in hell can attain. However, O my Lord, You are so kind that You bestow mercy even upon them.",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Seventh Chapter, there are two kinds of devotees \u2014 those who desire material pleasures and those who desire nothing but service to the Lord. Material pleasures can be attained even by hogs and dogs, whose condition of life is hellish. The hog also eats, sleeps and enjoys sex life to the full extent, and it is also very satisfied with such hellish enjoyment of material existence. Modern yog\u012bs advise that because one has senses, one must enjoy to the fullest extent like cats and dogs, yet one can go on and practice yoga. This is condemned here by Kardama Muni; he says that such material pleasures are available for cats and dogs in a hellish condition. The Lord is so kind that if so-called yog\u012bs are satisfied by hellish pleasures, He can give them facilities to attain all the material pleasures they desire, but they cannot attain the perfectional stage attained by Kardama Muni. Hellish and demoniac persons do not actually know what is the ultimate attainment in perfection, and therefore they think that sense gratification is the highest goal of life. They advise that one can satisfy the senses and at the same time, by reciting some mantra and by some practice, can cheaply aspire for perfection. Such persons are described here as hata-medhasa\u1e25, which means \u201cthose whose brains are spoiled.\u201d They aspire for material enjoyment by perfection of yoga or meditation. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated by the Lord that the intelligence of those who worship the demigods has been spoiled. Similarly, here too it is stated by Kardama Muni that one who aspires after material enjoyment by practice of yoga has spoiled his brain substance and is fool number one. Actually, the intelligent practitioner of yoga should aspire for nothing else but to cross over the ocean of nescience by worshiping the Personality of Godhead and to see the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord is so kind, however, that even today persons whose brain substance is spoiled are given the benediction to become cats, dogs or hogs and enjoy material happiness from sex life and sense gratification. The Lord confirms this benediction in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cWhatever a person aspires to receive from Me, I offer him as he desires.\u201d"

        "purport": " In spite of his condemning persons who approach the Lord for material advantages, Kardama Muni expressed his material inability and desire before the Lord by saying, \u201cAlthough I know that nothing material should be asked from You, I nevertheless desire to marry a girl of like disposition.\u201d The phrase \u201clike disposition\u201d is very significant. Formerly, boys and girls of similar dispositions were married; the similar natures of the boy and girl were united in order to make them happy. Not more than twenty-five years ago, and perhaps it is still current, parents in India used to consult the horoscope of the boy and girl to see whether there would be factual union in their psychological conditions. These considerations are very important. Nowadays marriage takes place without such consultation, and therefore, soon after the marriage, there is divorce and separation. Formerly husband and wife used to live together peacefully throughout their whole lives, but nowadays it is a very difficult task. Kardama Muni wanted to have a wife of like disposition because a wife is necessary to assist in spiritual and material advancement. It is said that a wife yields the fulfillment of all desires in religion, economic development and sense gratification. If one has a nice wife, he is to be considered a most fortunate man. In astrology, a man is considered fortunate who has great wealth, very good sons or a very good wife. Of these three, one who has a very good wife is considered the most fortunate. Before marrying, one should select a wife of like disposition and not be enamored by so-called beauty or other attractive features for sense gratification. In the Bh\u0101gavatam, Twelfth Canto, it is said that in the Kali-yuga marriage will be based on the consideration of sex life; as soon as there is deficiency in sex life, the question of divorce will arise. Kardama Muni could have asked his benediction from Um\u0101, for it is recommended in the scriptures that if anyone wants a good wife, he should worship Um\u0101. But he preferred to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead because it is recommended in the Bh\u0101gavatam that everyone, whether he is full of desires, has no desire or desires liberation, should worship the Supreme Lord. Of these three classes of men, one tries to be happy by fulfillment of material desires, another wants to be happy by becoming one with the Supreme, and another, the perfect man, is a devotee. He does not want anything in return from the Personality of Godhead; he only wants to render transcendental loving service. In any case, everyone should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He will fulfill everyone\u2019s desire. The advantage of worshiping the Supreme Person is that even if one has desires for material enjoyment, if he worships K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he will gradually become a pure devotee and have no more material hankering."

Following them, O embodiment of religion, I also bear oblations for You, who are eternal time.",
        "purport": " In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad it is stated that the Supreme Lord is the leader of all living entities. He is their sustainer and the awarder of all their necessities and desires. No living entity is independent; all are dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Vedic instruction is that one should enjoy life under the direction of the supreme leader, the Personality of Godhead. Vedic literatures like \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad direct that since everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not encroach upon another\u2019s property, but should enjoy one\u2019s individual allotment. The best program for every living entity is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and enjoy material or spiritual life. A question may be raised: Since Kardama Muni was advanced in spiritual life, why then did he not ask the Lord for liberation? Why did he want to enjoy material life in spite of his personally seeing and experiencing the Supreme Lord? The answer is that not everyone is competent to be liberated from material bondage. It is therefore everyone\u2019s duty to enjoy according to his present position, but under the direction of the Lord or the Vedas. The Vedas are considered to be the direct words of the Lord. The Lord gives us the opportunity to enjoy material life as we want, and at the same time He gives directions for the modes and processes of abiding by the Vedas so that gradually one may be elevated to liberation from material bondage. The conditioned souls who have come to the material world to fulfill their desires to lord it over material nature are bound by the laws of nature. The best course is to abide by the Vedic rules; that will help one to be gradually elevated to liberation. Kardama Muni addresses the Lord as \u015buka, which means \u201cthe leader of religion.\u201d One who is pious should follow the rules of religion, for such rules are prescribed by the Lord Himself. No one can manufacture or concoct a religion; \u201creligion\u201d refers to the injunctions or laws of the Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that religion means to surrender unto Him. Therefore one should follow the Vedic regulations and surrender unto the Supreme Lord because that is the ultimate goal of perfection in human life. One should live a life of piety, follow the religious rules and regulations, marry and live peacefully for elevation to the higher status of spiritual realization."

        "purport": " After describing the necessity of married life, Kardama Muni asserts that marriage and other social affairs are stereotyped regulations for persons who are addicted to material sense enjoyment. The principles of animal life \u2014 eating, sleeping, mating and defending \u2014 are actually necessities of the body, but those who engage in transcendental K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, giving up all the stereotyped activities of this material world, are freed from social conventions. Conditioned souls are under the spell of material energy, or eternal time \u2014 past, present and future \u2014 but as soon as one engages in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he transcends the limits of past and present and becomes situated in the eternal activities of the soul. One has to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions in order to enjoy material life, but those who have taken to the devotional service of the Lord are not afraid of the regulations of this material world. Such devotees do not care for the conventions of material activities; they boldly take to that shelter which is like an umbrella against the sun of repeated birth and death. Constant transmigration of the soul from one body to another is the cause of suffering in material existence. This conditional life in material existence is called sa\u1e41s\u0101ra. One may perform good work and take his birth in a very nice material condition, but the process under which birth and death take place is like a terrible fire. \u015ar\u012b Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, in his prayer to the spiritual master, has described this. Sa\u1e41s\u0101ra, or the repetition of birth and death, is compared to a forest fire. A forest fire takes place automatically, without anyone\u2019s endeavor, by the friction of dried wood, and no fire department or sympathetic person can extinguish it. The raging forest fire can be extinguished only when there is a constant downpour of water from a cloud. The cloud is compared to the mercy of the spiritual master. By the grace of the spiritual master the cloud of the mercy of the Personality of Godhead is brought in, and then only, when the rains of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness fall, can the fire of material existence be extinguished. This is also explained here. In order to find freedom from the stereotyped conditional life of material existence, one has to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, not in the manner in which the impersonalists indulge, but in devotional service, chanting and hearing of the activities of the Lord. Only then can one be freed from the actions and reactions of material existence. It is recommended here that one should give up the conditional life of this material world and the association of so-called civilized human beings who are simply following, in a polished way, the same stereotyped principles of eating, sleeping, defending and mating. Chanting and hearing of the glories of the Lord is described here as tvad-gu\u1e47a-v\u0101da-s\u012bdhu. Only by drinking the nectar of chanting and hearing the pastimes of the Lord can one forget the intoxication of material existence."

        "purport": " The time factor cannot affect the span of life of the devotees. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated that a little execution of devotional service saves one from the greatest danger. The greatest danger is transmigration of the soul from one body to another, and only devotional service to the Lord can stop this process. It is stated in the Vedic literatures, hari\u1e41 vin\u0101 na m\u1e5bti\u1e41 taranti: without the mercy of the Lord, one cannot stop the cycle of birth and death. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated that only by understanding the transcendental nature of the Lord and His activities, His appearance and disappearance can one stop the cycle of death and go back to Him. The time factor is divided into many fractions of moments, hours, months, years, periods, seasons, etc. All the divisions in this verse are determined according to the astronomical calculations of Vedic literature. There are six seasons, called \u1e5btus, and there is the period of four months called c\u0101turm\u0101sya. Three periods of four months complete one year. According to Vedic astronomical calculations, there are thirteen months. The thirteenth month is called adhi-m\u0101sa or mala-m\u0101sa and is added every third year. The time factor, however, cannot touch the lifespan of the devotees. In another verse it is stated that when the sun rises and sets it takes away the life of all living entities, but it cannot take away the life of those who are engaged in devotional service. Time is compared here to a big wheel which has 360 joints, six rims in the shape of seasons, and numberless leaves in the shape of moments. It rotates on the eternal existence, Brahman."

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that He allows the sense-enjoying living entities a separate world created by Him to enjoy as they like, yet at the same time He appears in His personal form. The Lord unwillingly creates this material world, but He descends in His personal form or sends one of His reliable sons or a servant or a reliable author like Vy\u0101sadeva to give instruction. He Himself also instructs in His speeches of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. This propaganda work goes on side by side with the creation to convince the misguided living entities who are rotting in this material world to come back to Him and surrender unto Him. Therefore the last instruction of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is this: \u201cGive up all your manufactured engagements in the material world and just surrender unto Me. I shall protect you from all sinful reactions.\u201d"

        "translation": "I continuously offer my respectful obeisances unto Your lotus feet, of which it is worthy to take shelter, because You shower all benedictions on the insignificant. To give all living entities detachment from fruitive activity by realizing You, You have expanded these material worlds by Your own energy.",
        "purport": " Everyone, therefore, whether he desires material enjoyment, liberation or the transcendental loving service of the Lord, should engage himself in offering obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, because the Lord can award everyone his desired benediction. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord affirms, ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante: anyone who desires to be a successful enjoyer in this material world is awarded that benediction by the Lord, anyone who wants to be liberated from the entanglement of this material world is given liberation by the Lord, and anyone who desires to constantly engage in His service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is awarded that benediction by the Lord. For material enjoyment He has prescribed so many ritualistic sacrificial performances in the Vedas, and thus people may take advantage of those instructions and enjoy material life in higher planets or in a noble aristocratic family. These processes are mentioned in the Vedas, and one can take advantage of them. It is similar with those who want to be liberated from this material world. Unless one is disgusted with the enjoyment of this material world, he cannot aspire for liberation. Liberation is for one who is disgusted with material enjoyment. Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra says, therefore, ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101: those who have given up the attempt to be happy in this material world can inquire about the Absolute Truth. For those who want to know the Absolute Truth, the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra is available, as is \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the actual explanation of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. Since Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is also Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, by understanding \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra or Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 one can obtain real knowledge. When one obtains real knowledge, he becomes theoretically one with the Supreme, and when he actually begins the service of Brahman, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is not only liberated but situated in his spiritual life. Similarly, for those who want to lord it over material nature, there are so many departments of material enjoyment; material knowledge and material science are available, and the Lord provides for persons who want to enjoy them. The conclusion is that one should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for any benediction. The word k\u0101ma-var\u1e63am is very significant, for it indicates that He satisfies the desires of anyone who approaches Him. But one who sincerely loves K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and yet wants material enjoyment is in perplexity. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being very kind toward him, gives him an opportunity to engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, and so he gradually forgets the hallucination."

When the Lord replied to the sage Kardama, the word vacas\u0101m\u1e5btena is specifically mentioned, since He spoke from the transcendental world. He replied in transcendental words, and when He spoke His eyebrows moved with great affection. When a devotee praises the glories of the Lord, the Lord is very satisfied, and He bestows His transcendental benediction upon the devotee without reservation because He is always causelessly merciful toward His devotee."

But in others\u2019 opinion, Brahm\u0101varta is a place in Brahmaloka, where Sv\u0101yambhuva ruled. There are many places on the surface of this earth which are also known in the higher planetary systems; we have places on this planet like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Dv\u0101rak\u0101 and Mathur\u0101, but they are also eternally situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. There are many similar names on the surface of the earth, and it may be that in the Boar age Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu ruled this planet, as stated here. The word ma\u1e45gala\u1e25 is significant. Ma\u1e45gala means one who is elevated in every respect in the opulences of religious performances, ruling power, cleanliness and all other good qualities. Vikhy\u0101ta means \u201ccelebrated.\u201d Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu was celebrated for all good qualities and opulences."

This is the duty of parents. Girls are never thrown into the public street to search out their husband, for when girls are grown up and are searching after a boy, they forget to consider whether the boy they select is actually suitable for them. Out of the urge of sex desire, a girl may accept anyone, but if the husband is chosen by the parents, they can consider who is to be selected and who is not. According to the Vedic system, therefore, the girl is given over to a suitable boy by the parents; she is never allowed to select her own husband independently."

        "purport": " The Lord awards all benedictions according to the heart\u2019s desire of a devotee, so the Lord informed Kardama Muni, \u201cThe girl who is coming to be married with you is a princess, the daughter of Emperor Sv\u0101yambhuva, and so just suitable for your purpose.\u201d Only by God\u2019s grace can one get a nice wife just as he desires. Similarly, it is only by God\u2019s grace that a girl gets a husband suitable to her heart. Thus it is said that if we pray to the Supreme Lord in every transaction of our material existence, everything will be done very nicely and just suitable to our heart\u2019s desire. In other words, in all circumstances we must take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and depend completely on His decision. Man proposes, God disposes. The fulfillment of desires, therefore, should be entrusted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; that is the nicest solution. Kardama Muni desired only a wife, but because he was a devotee of the Lord, the Lord selected a wife for him who was the Emperor\u2019s daughter, a princess. Thus Kardama Muni got a wife beyond his expectation. If we depend on the choice of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will receive benedictions in greater opulence than we desire. It is also significantly noted here that Kardama Muni was a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, whereas Emperor Sv\u0101yambhuva was a k\u1e63atriya. Therefore, intercaste marriage was current even in those days. The system was that a br\u0101hma\u1e47a could marry the daughter of a k\u1e63atriya, but a k\u1e63atriya could not marry the daughter of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. We have evidences from the history of the Vedic age that \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya offered his daughter to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yay\u0101ti, but the King had to refuse to marry the daughter of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a; only with the special permission of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a could they marry. Thus intercaste marriage was not prohibited in the olden days, many millions of years ago, but there was a regular system of social behavior."

        "translation": "Showing compassion to all living entities, you will attain self-realization. Giving assurance of safety to all, you will perceive your own self as well as all the universes in Me, and Myself in you.",
        "purport": " The simple process of self-realization for every living entity is described here. The first principle to be understood is that this world is a product of the supreme will. There is an identity of this world with the Supreme Lord. This identity is accepted in a misconceived way by the impersonalists; they say that the Supreme Absolute Truth, transforming Himself into the universe, loses His separate existence. Thus they accept the world and everything in it to be the Lord. That is pantheism, wherein everything is considered to be the Lord. This is the view of the impersonalist. But those who are personal devotees of the Lord take everything to be the property of the Supreme Lord. Everything, whatever we see, is the manifestation of the Supreme Lord; therefore, everything should be engaged in the service of the Lord. This is oneness. The difference between the impersonalist and the personalist is that the impersonalist does not accept the separate existence of the Lord, but the personalist accepts the Lord; he understands that although He distributes Himself in so many ways, He has His separate personal existence. This is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cI am spread all over the universe in My impersonal form. Everything is resting on Me, but I am not present.\u201d There is a nice example regarding the sun and the sunshine. The sun, by its sunshine, is spread all over the universe, and all the planets rest on the sunshine. But all the planets are different from the sun planet; one cannot say that because the planets are resting on the sunshine, these planets are also the sun. Similarly, the impersonal or pantheistic view that everything is God is not a very intelligent proposal. The real position, as explained by the Lord Himself, is that although nothing can exist without Him, it is not a fact that everything is Him. He is different from everything. So here also the Lord says, \u201cYou will see everything in the world to be nondifferent from Me.\u201d This means that everything should be considered a product of the Lord\u2019s energy, and therefore everything should be employed in the service of the Lord. One\u2019s energy should be utilized for one\u2019s self-interest. That is the perfection of the energy. This energy can be utilized for real self-interest if one is compassionate. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, a devotee of the Lord, is always compassionate. He is not satisfied that only he himself is a devotee, but he tries to distribute the knowledge of devotional service to everyone. There are many devotees of the Lord who faced many risks in distributing the devotional service of the Lord to people in general. That should be done. It is also said that a person who goes to the temple of the Lord and worships with great devotion, but who does not show sympathy to people in general or show respect to other devotees, is considered to be a third-class devotee. The second-class devotee is he who is merciful and compassionate to the fallen soul. The second-class devotee is always cognizant of his position as an eternal servant of the Lord; he therefore makes friendships with devotees of the Lord, acts compassionately toward the general public in teaching them devotional service, and refuses to cooperate or associate with nondevotees. As long as one is not compassionate to people in general in his devotional service to the Lord, he is a third-class devotee. The first-class devotee gives assurance to every living being that there is no fear of this material existence: \u201cLet us live in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and conquer the nescience of material existence.\u201d It is indicated here that Kardama Muni was directed by the Lord to be very compassionate and liberal in his householder life and to give assurance to the people in his renounced life. A sanny\u0101s\u012b, one in the renounced order of life, is meant to give enlightenment to the people. He should travel, going from home to home to enlighten. The householder, by the spell of m\u0101y\u0101, becomes absorbed in family affairs and forgets his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If he dies in forgetfulness, like the cats and dogs, then his life is spoiled. It is the duty of a sanny\u0101s\u012b, therefore, to go and awaken the forgetful souls with enlightenment of their eternal relationship with the Lord and to engage them in devotional service. The devotee should show mercy to the fallen souls and also give them the assurance of fearlessness. As soon as one becomes a devotee of the Lord, he is convinced that he is protected by the Lord. Fear itself is afraid of the Lord; therefore, what has he to do with fearfulness? To award fearlessness to the common man is the greatest act of charity. A sanny\u0101s\u012b, or one who is in the renounced order of life, should wander from door to door, from village to village, from town to town and from country to country, all over the world as far as he is able to travel, and enlighten the householders about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A person who is a householder but is initiated by a sanny\u0101s\u012b has the duty to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness at home; as far as possible, he should call his friends and neighbors to his house and hold classes in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Holding a class means chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and speaking from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. There are immense literatures for spreading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and it is the duty of each and every householder to learn about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from his sanny\u0101s\u012b spiritual master. There is a division of labor in the Lord\u2019s service. The householder\u2019s duty is to earn money because a sanny\u0101s\u012b is not supposed to earn money but is completely dependent on the householder. The householder should earn money by business or by profession and spend at least fifty percent of his income to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; twenty-five percent he can spend for his family, and twenty-five percent he should save to meet emergencies. This example was shown by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, so devotees should follow it. Actually, to be one with the Supreme Lord means to be one with the interest of the Lord. Becoming one with the Supreme Lord does not imply becoming as great as the Supreme Lord. It is impossible. The part is never equal to the whole. The living entity is always a minute part. Therefore his oneness with the Lord is that he is interested in the one interest of the Lord. The Lord wants every living entity to always think about Him, to be His devotee, and to always worship Him. This is clearly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakta\u1e25. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants everyone always to think of Him. Everyone should always offer obeisances to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the will of the Supreme Lord, and devotees should try to fulfill His desire. Since the Lord is unlimited, His desire is also unlimited. There is no stoppage, and therefore the service of the devotee is also unlimited. In the transcendental world there is unlimited competition between the Lord and the servitor. The Lord wants to fulfill His desires unlimitedly, and the devotee also serves Him to fulfill His unlimited desires. There is an unlimited oneness of interest between the Lord and His devotee."

        "purport": " Herein the word sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-kalay\u0101 indicates that the Lord would appear as the son of Devah\u016bti and Kardama Muni as Kapiladeva, the first propounder of the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, which is mentioned here as tattva-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. The Lord foretold to Kardama Muni that He would appear in His incarnation Kapiladeva and would propagate the philosophy of S\u0101\u1e45khya. S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is very well known in the world as propagated by another Kapiladeva, but that S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is different from the S\u0101\u1e45khya which was propounded by the Lord Himself. There are two kinds of S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy: one is godless S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, and the other is godly S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy. The S\u0101\u1e45khya propagated by Kapiladeva, son of Devah\u016bti, is godly philosophy. There are different manifestations of the Lord. He is one, but He has become many. He divides Himself into two different expansions, one called kal\u0101 and the other vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba. Ordinary living entities are called vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba expansions, and the unlimited expansions of vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, such as V\u0101mana, Govinda, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Pradyumna, V\u0101sudeva and Ananta, are called sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-kal\u0101. Sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba refers to a direct expansion, and kal\u0101 denotes an expansion from the expansion of the original Lord. Baladeva is an expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and from Baladeva the next expansion is Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a; thus Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a is kal\u0101, but Baladeva is sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba. There is no difference, however, among Them. This is very nicely explained in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.46): d\u012bp\u0101rcir eva hi da\u015b\u0101ntaram abhyupetya. With one candle one may light a second candle, with the second a third and then a fourth, and in this way one can light up thousands of candles, and no candle is inferior to another in distributing light. Every candle has the full candlepower, but there is still the distinction that one candle is the first, another the second, another the third and another the fourth. Similarly, there is no difference between the immediate expansion of the Lord and His secondary expansion. The Lord\u2019s names are considered in exactly the same way. Since the Lord is absolute, His name, His form, His pastimes, His paraphernalia and His qualities all have the same potency. In the absolute world, the name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the transcendental sound representation of the Lord. There is no difference in potency between His qualities, name, form, etc. If we chant the name of the Lord, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that has as much potency as the Lord Himself. There is no difference in potency between the form of the Lord whom we worship and the form of the Lord in the temple. One should not think that one is worshiping a doll or statue of the Lord, even if others consider it to be a statue. Because there is no difference in potency, one gets the same result by worshiping the statue of the Lord or the Lord Himself. This is the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

The sage stood listening as the hymns forming the basis of the S\u0101ma Veda were vibrated by the flapping wings of the Lord\u2019s carrier, Garu\u1e0da.",
        "purport": " In the Vedic literature it is stated that the two wings of the transcendental bird Garu\u1e0da, who carries the Lord everywhere, are two divisions of the S\u0101ma Veda, known as b\u1e5bhat and rath\u0101ntara. Garu\u1e0da works as the carrier of the Lord; therefore he is considered the transcendental prince of all carriers. With his two wings Garu\u1e0da began to vibrate the S\u0101ma Veda, which is chanted by great sages to pacify the Lord. The Lord is worshiped by Brahm\u0101, by Lord \u015aiva, by Garu\u1e0da and other demigods with selected poems, and great sages worship Him with the hymns of Vedic literatures, such as the Upani\u1e63ads and S\u0101ma Veda. These S\u0101ma Veda utterances are automatically heard by the devotee when another great devotee of the Lord, Garu\u1e0da, flaps his wings. It is clearly stated here that the sage Kardama began to look to the path by which the Lord was being carried to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. It is thus confirmed that the Lord descends from His abode, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, in the spiritual sky, and is carried by Garu\u1e0da. The path which leads to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha is not worshiped by the ordinary class of transcendentalists. Only those who are already liberated from material bondage can become devotees of the Lord. Those who are not liberated from material bondage cannot understand transcendental devotional service. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly stated, yatat\u0101m api siddh\u0101n\u0101m. There are many persons who are trying to attain perfection by striving for liberation from material bondage, and those who are actually liberated are called brahma-bh\u016bta or siddha. Only the siddhas, or persons liberated from material bondage, can become devotees. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: anyone who is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or devotional service, is already liberated from the influence of the modes of material nature. Here it is also confirmed that the path of devotional service is worshiped by liberated persons, not the conditioned souls. The conditioned soul cannot understand the devotional service of the Lord. Kardama Muni was a liberated soul who saw the Supreme Lord in person, face to face. There was no doubt that he was liberated, and thus he could see Garu\u1e0da carrying the Lord on the way to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and hear the flapping of his wings vibrating the sound of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the essence of the S\u0101ma Veda."

Just as drops of perspiration which fell from the toe of the Lord became the sacred Ganges, so teardrops from the transcendental eyes of the Lord became Bindu-sarovara. Both are transcendental entities and are worshiped by great sages and scholars. The water of Bindu-sarovara is described here as \u015biv\u0101m\u1e5bta jala. \u015aiva means \u201ccuring.\u201d Anyone who drinks the water of Bindu-sarovara is cured of all material diseases; similarly, anyone who takes his bath in the Ganges also is relieved of all material diseases. These claims are accepted by great scholars and authorities and are still being acted upon even in this fallen Age of Kali."

His body shone most brilliantly; though he had engaged in austere penance for a long time, he was not emaciated, for the Lord had cast His affectionate sidelong glance upon him and he had also heard the nectar flowing from the moonlike words of the Lord. The sage was tall, his eyes were large, like the petals of a lotus, and he had matted locks on his head. He was clad in rags. Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu approached and saw him to be somewhat soiled, like an unpolished gem.",
        "purport": " Here are some descriptions of a brahmac\u0101r\u012b-yog\u012b. In the morning, the first duty of a brahmac\u0101r\u012b seeking spiritual elevation is huta-hut\u0101\u015bana, to offer sacrificial oblations to the Supreme Lord. Those engaged in brahmacarya cannot sleep until seven or nine o\u2019clock in the morning. They must rise early in the morning, at least one and a half hours before the sun rises, and offer oblations, or in this age, they must chant the holy name of the Lord, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As referred to by Lord Caitanya, kalau n\u0101sty eva n\u0101sty eva n\u0101sty eva gatir anyath\u0101: there is no other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative, in this age, to chanting the holy name of the Lord. The brahmac\u0101r\u012b must rise early in the morning and, after placing himself, should chant the holy name of the Lord. From the very features of the sage, it appeared that he had undergone great austerities; that is the sign of one observing brahmacarya, the vow of celibacy. If one lives otherwise, it will be manifest in the lust visible in his face and body. The word vidyotam\u0101nam indicates that the brahmac\u0101r\u012b feature showed in his body. That is the certificate that one has undergone great austerity in yoga. A drunkard or smoker or sex-monger can never be eligible to practice yoga. Generally yog\u012bs look very skinny because of their not being comfortably situated, but Kardama Muni was not emaciated, for he had seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. Here the word snigdh\u0101p\u0101\u1e45g\u0101valokan\u0101t means that he was fortunate enough to see the Supreme Lord face to face. He looked healthy because he had directly received the nectarean sound vibrations from the lotus lips of the Personality of Godhead. Similarly, one who hears the transcendental sound vibration of the holy name of the Lord, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, also improves in health. We have actually seen that many brahmac\u0101r\u012bs and g\u1e5bhasthas connected with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness have improved in health, and a luster has come to their faces. It is essential that a brahmac\u0101r\u012b engaged in spiritual advancement look very healthy and lustrous. The comparison of the sage to an unpolished gem is very appropriate. Even if a gem just taken from a mine looks unpolished, the luster of the gem cannot be stopped. Similarly, although Kardama was not properly dressed and his body was not properly cleansed, his overall appearance was gemlike."

        "purport": " It appears from many Vedic literatures, especially histories like \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and the other Pur\u0101\u1e47as, that the pious kings of old used to tour their kingdoms in order to give protection to the pious citizens and to chastise or kill the impious. Sometimes they used to kill animals in the forests to practice the killing art because without such practice they would not be able to kill the undesirable elements. K\u1e63atriyas are allowed to commit violence in that way because violence for a good purpose is a part of their duty. Here two terms are clearly mentioned: vadh\u0101ya, \u201cfor the purpose of killing,\u201d and asat\u0101m, \u201cthose who are undesirable.\u201d The protecting energy of the king is supposed to be the energy of the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.8) the Lord says, paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m. The Lord descends to give protection to the pious and to kill the demons. Therefore the potency to give protection to the pious and kill the demons or undesirables is directly an energy from the Supreme Lord, and the king or the chief executive of the state is supposed to possess such energy. In this age it is very difficult to find such a head of state who is expert in killing the undesirables. Modern heads of state sit very nicely in their palaces and try without reason to kill innocent persons."

        "purport": " It is the duty of a responsible king to protect the social and spiritual orders in human society. The spiritual orders are divided into four \u0101\u015bramas \u2014 brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa \u2014 and the social orders, according to work and qualification, are made up of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the k\u1e63atriyas, the vai\u015byas and the \u015b\u016bdras. These social orders, according to the different grades of work and qualification, are described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Unfortunately, for want of proper protection by responsible kings, the system of social and spiritual orders has now become a hereditary caste system. But this is not the actual system. Human society means that society which is making progress toward spiritual realization. The most advanced human society was known as \u0101rya; \u0101rya refers to those who are advancing. So the question is, \u201cWhich society is advancing?\u201d Advancement does not mean creating material \u201cnecessities\u201d unnecessarily and thus wasting human energy in aggravation over so-called material comforts. Real advancement is advancement toward spiritual realization, and the community which acted toward this end was known as the \u0100ryan civilization. The intelligent men, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, as exemplified by Kardama Muni, were engaged in advancing the spiritual cause, and k\u1e63atriyas like Emperor Sv\u0101yambhuva used to rule the country and insure that all facilities for spiritual realization were nicely provided. It is the duty of the king to travel all over the country and see that everything is in order. Indian civilization on the basis of the four var\u1e47as and \u0101\u015bramas deteriorated because of her dependency on foreigners, or those who did not follow the civilization of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama. Thus the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system has now been degraded into the caste system. The institution of four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas is confirmed herewith to be bhagavad-racita, which means \u201cdesigned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this is also confirmed: c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam. The Lord says that the institution of four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas \u201cis created by Me.\u201d Anything created by the Lord cannot be closed or covered. The divisions of var\u1e47as and \u0101\u015bramas will continue to exist, either in their original form or in degraded form, but because they are created by the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they cannot be extinguished. They are like the sun, a creation of God, and therefore will remain. Either covered by clouds or in a clear sky, the sun will continue to exist. Similarly, when the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system becomes degraded, it appears as a hereditary caste system, but in every society there is an intelligent class of men, a martial class, a mercantile class and a laborer class. When they are regulated for cooperation among communities according to the Vedic principles, then there is peace and spiritual advancement. But when there is hatred and malpractice and mutual mistrust in the caste system, the whole system becomes degraded, and as stated herein, it creates a deplorable state. At the present moment, the entire world is in this deplorable condition because of giving rights to so many interests. This is due to the degradation of the four castes of var\u1e47as and \u0101\u015bramas."

        "purport": " Because the scientific division of four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas is now being extinguished, the entire world is being governed by unwanted men who have no training in religion, politics or social order, and it is in a very deplorable condition. In the institution of four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas there are regular training principles for the different classes of men. Just as, in the modern age, there is a necessity for engineers, medical practitioners and electricians, and they are properly trained in different scientific institutions, similarly, in former times, the higher social orders, namely the intelligent class (the br\u0101hma\u1e47as), the ruling class (the k\u1e63atriyas) and the mercantile class (the vai\u015byas), were properly trained. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 describes the duties of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras. When there is no such training, one simply claims that because he is born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or k\u1e63atriya family, he is therefore a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or a k\u1e63atriya, even though he performs the duties of a \u015b\u016bdra. Such undue claims to being a higher-caste man make the system of scientific social orders into a caste system, completely degrading the original system. Thus society is now in chaos, and there is neither peace nor prosperity. It is clearly stated herein that unless there is the vigilance of a strong king, impious, unqualified men will claim a certain status in society, and that will make the social order perish."

        "purport": " When a guest comes to a friend\u2019s house, it is understood that there is some special purpose. Kardama Muni could understand that such a great king as Sv\u0101yambhuva, although traveling to inspect the condition of his kingdom, must have had some special purpose to come to his hermitage. Thus he prepared himself to fulfill the King\u2019s desire. Formerly it was customary that the sages used to go to the kings and the kings used to visit the sages in their hermitages; each was glad to fulfill the other\u2019s purpose. This reciprocal relationship is called bhakti-k\u0101rya. There is a nice verse describing the relationship of mutual beneficial interest between the br\u0101hma\u1e47a and the k\u1e63atriya (k\u1e63atra\u1e41 dvijatvam). K\u1e63atram means \u201cthe royal order,\u201d and dvijatvam means \u201cthe brahminical order.\u201d The two were meant for mutual interest. The royal order would give protection to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as for the cultivation of spiritual advancement in society, and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as would give their valuable instruction to the royal order on how the state and the citizens can gradually be elevated in spiritual perfection."
