Now I shall request You to explain the path of devotional service, which is the ultimate end of all philosophical systems.",
        "purport": " In this Twenty-ninth Chapter, the glories of devotional service are elaborately explained, and the influence of time on the conditioned soul is also described. The purpose of elaborately describing the influence of time is to detach the conditioned soul from his material activities, which are considered to be simply a waste of time. In the previous chapter, material nature, the spirit and the Supreme Lord, or Supersoul, are analytically studied, and in this chapter the principles of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service \u2014 the execution of activities in the eternal relationship between the living entities and the Personality of Godhead \u2014 are explained. Bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the basic principle of all systems of philosophy; all philosophy which does not aim for devotional service to the Lord is considered merely mental speculation. But of course bhakti-yoga with no philosophical basis is more or less sentiment. There are two classes of men. Some consider themselves intellectually advanced and simply speculate and meditate, and others are sentimental and have no philosophical basis for their propositions. Neither of these can achieve the highest goal of life \u2014 or, if they do, it will take them many, many years. Vedic literature therefore suggests that there are three elements \u2014 namely the Supreme Lord, the living entity and their eternal relationship \u2014 and that the goal of life is to follow the principles of bhakti, or devotional service, and ultimately attain to the planet of the Supreme Lord in full devotion and love as an eternal servitor of the Lord. S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is the analytical study of all existence. One has to understand everything by examining its nature and characteristics. This is called acquirement of knowledge. But one should not simply acquire knowledge without reaching the goal of life or the basic principle for acquiring knowledge \u2014 bhakti-yoga. If we give up bhakti-yoga and simply busy ourselves in the analytical study of the nature of things as they are, then the result will be practically nil. It is stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam that such engagement is something like husking a paddy. There is no use beating the husk if the grain has already been removed. By the scientific study of material nature, the living entity and the Supersoul, one has to understand the basic principle of devotional service to the Lord."

People who have no knowledge of this material world, God and their actual intimate relationship with Him are actually going to the darkest region of material existence in the name of progress in the material advancement of civilization. To enter the darkest region of material existence means to enter into a species of life other than the human species. Ignorant men do not know that after this life they are completely under the grip of material nature and will be offered a life which may not be very congenial. How a living entity gets different kinds of bodies will be explained in the next chapter. This continual change of bodies in birth and death is called sa\u1e41s\u0101ra. Devah\u016bti requests her glorious son, Kapila Muni, to explain about this continued journey to impress upon the conditioned souls that they are undergoing a path of degradation by not understanding the path of bhakti-yoga, devotional service."

From the date of the birth of the body, the influence of death is also acting; the advancement of age entails the influence of time on the body. If a man is thirty or fifty years old, then the influence of time has already devoured thirty or fifty years of the duration of his life. Everyone is conscious of the last stage of life, when he will meet the cruel hands of death, but some consider their age and circumstances, concern themselves with the influence of time and thus engage in pious activities so that in the future they will not be put into a low family or an animal species. Generally, people are attached to sense enjoyment and so aspire for life on the heavenly planets; therefore they engage themselves in charitable or other pious activities. But actually, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one cannot get relief from the chain of birth and death even if he goes to the highest planet, Brahmaloka, because the influence of time is present everywhere within this material world. In the spiritual world, however, the time factor has no influence."

The Lord is described herein as yoga-bh\u0101skara, the sun of the system of all yoga. Devah\u016bti has already requested her glorious son to describe bhakti-yoga, and the Lord has described bhakti-yoga as the ultimate yoga system. Bhakti-yoga is the sunlike illumination for delivering the conditioned souls, whose general condition is described here. They have no eyes to see their own interests. They do not know that the goal of life is not to increase the material necessities of existence, because the body will not exist more than a few years. The living beings are eternal, and they have their eternal need. If one engages only in caring for the necessities of the body, not caring for the eternal necessities of life, then he is part of a civilization whose advancement puts the living entities in the darkest region of ignorance. Sleeping in that darkest region, one does not get any refreshment, but, rather, gradually becomes fatigued. He invents many processes to adjust this fatigued condition, but he fails and thus remains confused. The only path for mitigating his fatigue in the struggle for existence is the path of devotional service, or the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Since He is perpetually compassionate towards them, if some of His devotees also become compassionate towards them, He is very pleased with the devotees. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly stated that persons who are trying to elevate the condition of the fallen souls by preaching the conclusion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 \u2014 namely, full surrender unto the Personality of Godhead \u2014 are very dear to Him. Thus when the Lord saw that His beloved mother was very compassionate towards the fallen souls, He was pleased, and He also became compassionate towards her."

A person who is distressed because of material conditions becomes a devotee of the Lord and approaches the Lord for mitigation of his distress. A person in need of money approaches the Lord to ask for some improvement in his monetary condition. Others, who are not in distress or in need of monetary assistance but are seeking knowledge in order to understand the Absolute Truth, also take to devotional service, and they inquire into the nature of the Supreme Lord. This is very nicely described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.16). Actually the path of devotional service is one without a second, but according to the devotees\u2019 condition, devotional service appears in multifarious varieties, as will be nicely explained in the following verses."

In pure devotional service, the only motive should be to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is not actually a motive; that is the pure condition of the living entity. In the conditioned stage, when one engages in devotional service he should follow the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master in full surrender. The spiritual master is the manifested representation of the Supreme Lord because he receives and presents the instructions of the Lord, as they are, by disciplic succession. It is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the teachings therein should be received by disciplic succession, otherwise there is adulteration. To act under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master with a motive to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pure devotional service. But if one has a motive for personal sense gratification, his devotional service is manifested differently. Such a man may be violent, proud, envious and angry, and his interests are separate from the Lord\u2019s. One who approaches the Supreme Lord to render devotional service but who is proud of his personality, envious of others or vengeful is in the mode of anger. He thinks that he is the best devotee. Devotional service executed in this way is not pure; it is mixed and is of the lowest grade, t\u0101masa\u1e25. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura advises that a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava who is not of good character should be avoided. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is one who has taken the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the ultimate goal of life, but if one is not pure and still has motives, then he is not a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava of the first order of good character. One may offer his respects to such a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava because he has accepted the Supreme Lord as the ultimate goal of life, but one should not keep company with a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava who is in the mode of ignorance."

A separatist is one who sees his interest as separate from that of the Supreme Lord. Mixed devotees, or devotees in the modes of passion and ignorance, think that the interest of the Supreme Lord is supplying the orders of the devotee; the interest of such devotees is to draw from the Lord as much as possible for their sense gratification. This is the separatist mentality. Actually, pure devotion is explained in the previous chapter: the mind of the Supreme Lord and the mind of the devotee should be dovetailed. A devotee should not wish anything but to execute the desire of the Supreme. That is oneness. When the devotee has an interest or will different from the interest of the Supreme Lord, his mentality is that of a separatist. When the so-called devotee desires material enjoyment, without reference to the interest of the Supreme Lord, or he wants to become famous or opulent by utilizing the mercy or grace of the Supreme Lord, he is in the mode of passion. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, however, interpret this word \u201cseparatist\u201d in a different way. They say that while worshiping the Lord, one should think himself one with the Supreme Lord. This is another adulterated form of devotion within the modes of material nature. The conception that the living entity is one with the Supreme is in the mode of ignorance. Oneness is actually based on oneness of interest. A pure devotee has no interest but to act on behalf of the Supreme Lord. When one has even a tinge of personal interest, his devotion is mixed with the three modes of material nature."

When such activities are performed and the results are offered to the Supreme Lord, they are called karm\u0101rpa\u1e47am, duties performed for the satisfaction of the Lord. If there is any inebriety or fault, it is atoned for by this offering process. But if this offering process is in the mode of goodness rather than in pure devotion, then the interest is different. The four \u0101\u015bramas and the four var\u1e47as act for some benefit in accordance with their personal interests. Therefore such activities are in the mode of goodness; they cannot be counted in the category of pure devotion.

There can be no excuse for personal or material interest. Devotional activities should be transcendental to fruitive activities and empiric philosophical speculation. Pure devotional service is transcendental to all material qualities. Devotional service in the modes of ignorance, passion and goodness can be divided into eighty-one categories. There are different devotional activities, such as hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, offering prayer, rendering service and surrendering everything, and each of them can be divided into three qualitative categories. There is hearing in the mode of passion, in the mode of ignorance and in the mode of goodness. Similarly, there is chanting in the mode of ignorance, passion and goodness, etc. Three multiplied by nine equals twenty-seven, and when again multiplied by three it becomes eighty-one. One has to transcend all such mixed materialistic devotional service in order to reach the standard of pure devotional service, as explained in the next verses."

        "translation": "The manifestation of unadulterated devotional service is exhibited when one\u2019s mind is at once attracted to hearing the transcendental name and qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is residing in everyone\u2019s heart. Just as the water of the Ganges flows naturally down towards the ocean, such devotional ecstasy, uninterrupted by any material condition, flows towards the Supreme Lord.",
        "purport": " The basic principle of this unadulterated, pure devotional service is love of Godhead. Mad-gu\u1e47a-\u015bruti-m\u0101tre\u1e47a means \u201cjust after hearing about the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d These qualities are called nirgu\u1e47a. The Supreme Lord is uncontaminated by the modes of material nature; therefore He is attractive to the pure devotee. There is no need to practice meditation to attain such attraction; the pure devotee is already in the transcendental stage, and the affinity between him and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is natural and is compared to the Ganges water flowing towards the sea. The flow of the Ganges water cannot be stopped by any condition; similarly, a pure devotee\u2019s attraction for the transcendental name, form and pastimes of the Supreme Godhead cannot be stopped by any material condition. The word avicchinn\u0101, \u201cwithout interruptions,\u201d is very important in this connection. No material condition can stop the flow of the devotional service of a pure devotee. The word ahaituk\u012b means \u201cwithout reason.\u201d A pure devotee does not render loving service to the Personality of Godhead for any cause or for any benefit, material or spiritual. This is the first symptom of unalloyed devotion. Any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam: he has no desire to fulfill by rendering devotional service. Such devotional service is meant for the puru\u1e63ottama, the Supreme Personality, and not for anyone else. Sometimes pseudodevotees show devotion to many demigods, thinking the forms of the demigods to be the same as the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s form. It is specifically mentioned herein, however, that bhakti, devotional service, is meant only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 not for anyone else. Avyavahit\u0101 means \u201cwithout cessation.\u201d A pure devotee must engage in the service of the Lord twenty-four hours a day, without cessation; his life is so molded that at every minute and every second he engages in some sort of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Another meaning of the word avyavahit\u0101 is that the interest of the devotee and the interest of the Supreme Lord are on the same level. The devotee has no interest but to fulfill the transcendental desire of the Supreme Lord. Such spontaneous service unto the Supreme Lord is transcendental and is never contaminated by the material modes of nature. These are the symptoms of pure devotional service, which is free from all contamination of material nature."

        "purport": " Lord Caitanya teaches us how to execute pure devotional service out of spontaneous love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the \u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka, He prays to the Lord: \u201cO Lord, I do not wish to gain from You any wealth, nor do I wish to have a beautiful wife, nor do I wish to have many followers. All I want from You is that in life after life I may remain a pure devotee at Your lotus feet.\u201d There is a similarity between the prayers of Lord Caitanya and the statements of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Lord Caitanya prays, \u201cin life after life,\u201d indicating that a devotee does not even desire the cessation of birth and death. The yog\u012bs and empiric philosophers desire cessation of the process of birth and death, but a devotee is satisfied even to remain in this material world and execute devotional service. It is clearly stated herein that a pure devotee does not desire ekatva, oneness with the Supreme Lord, as desired by the impersonalists, the mental speculators and the meditators. To become one with the Supreme Lord is beyond the dream of a pure devotee. Sometimes he may accept promotion to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets to serve the Lord there, but he will never accept merging into the Brahman effulgence, which he considers worse than hellish. Such ekatva, or merging into the effulgence of the Supreme Lord, is called kaivalya, but the happiness derived from kaivalya is considered by the pure devotee to be hellish. The devotee is so fond of rendering service to the Supreme Lord that the five kinds of liberation are not important to him. If one is engaged in pure transcendental loving service to the Lord, it is understood that he has already achieved the five kinds of liberation. When a devotee is promoted to the spiritual world, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, he receives four kinds of facilities. One of these is s\u0101lokya, living on the same planet as the Supreme Personality. The Supreme Person, in His different plenary expansions, lives on innumerable Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, and the chief planet is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. Just as within the material universe the chief planet is the sun, in the spiritual world the chief planet is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. From K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, the bodily effulgence of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is distributed not only to the spiritual world but to the material world as well; it is covered by matter, however, in the material world. In the spiritual world there are innumerable Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, and on each one the Lord is the predominating Deity. A devotee can be promoted to one such Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet to live with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In s\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6di liberation the opulence of the devotee is equal to the opulence of the Supreme Lord. S\u0101m\u012bpya means to be a personal associate of the Supreme Lord. In s\u0101r\u016bpya liberation the bodily features of the devotee are exactly like those of the Supreme Person but for two or three symptoms found exclusively on the transcendental body of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bvatsa, for example, the hair on the chest of the Lord, particularly distinguishes Him from His devotees. A pure devotee does not accept these five kinds of spiritual existence, even if they are offered, and he certainly does not hanker after material benefits, which are all insignificant in comparison with spiritual benefits. When Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was offered some material benefit, he stated, \u201cMy Lord, I have seen that my father achieved all kinds of material benefits, and even the demigods were afraid of his opulence, but still, in a second, You have finished his life and all his material prosperity.\u201d For a devotee there is no question of desiring any material or spiritual prosperity. He simply aspires to serve the Lord. That is his highest happiness."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, who is supposed to be the leader of the impersonalist school of philosophers, has admitted in the beginning of his comments on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is beyond the material creation; except for Him, everything is within the material creation. It is also confirmed in the Vedic literature that before the creation there was only N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; neither Lord Brahm\u0101 nor Lord \u015aiva existed. Only N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is always in the transcendental position, beyond the influence of material creation. The material qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance cannot affect the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is called nirgu\u1e47a (free from all tinges of material qualities). Here the same fact is confirmed by Lord Kapila: one who is situated in pure devotional service is transcendentally situated, as is the Lord. Just as the Lord is unaffected by the influence of the material modes, so too are His pure devotees. One who is not affected by the three modes of material nature is called a liberated soul, or brahma-bh\u016bta soul. Brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101 is the stage of liberation. Aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi: \u201cI am not this body.\u201d This is applicable only to the person who constantly engages in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and is thus in the transcendental stage; he is above the influence of the three modes of material nature. It is the misconception of the impersonalists that one can worship any imaginary form of the Lord, or Brahman, and at the end merge in the Brahman effulgence. Of course, to merge into the bodily effulgence (Brahman) of the Supreme Lord is also liberation, as explained in the previous verse. Ekatva is also liberation, but that sort of liberation is never accepted by any devotee, for qualitative oneness is immediately attained as soon as one is situated in devotional service. For a devotee, that qualitative equality, which is the result of impersonal liberation, is already attained; he does not have to try for it separately. It is clearly stated here that simply by pure devotional service one becomes qualitatively as good as the Lord Himself."

        "translation": "A devotee must execute his prescribed duties, which are glorious, without material profit. Without excessive violence, one should regularly perform one\u2019s devotional activities.",
        "purport": " One has to execute his prescribed duties according to his social position as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra. The prescribed duties of the four classes of men in human society are also described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The activities of br\u0101hma\u1e47as are to control the senses and to become simple, clean, learned devotees. The k\u1e63atriyas have the spirit for ruling, they are not afraid on the battlefield, and they are charitable. The vai\u015byas, or the mercantile class of men, trade in commodities, protect cows and develop agricultural produce. The \u015b\u016bdras, or laborer class, serve the higher classes because they themselves are not very intelligent. From every position, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sva-karma\u1e47\u0101 tam abhyarcya: one can serve the Supreme Lord by performing one\u2019s prescribed duty. It is not that only the br\u0101hma\u1e47as can serve the Supreme Lord and not the \u015b\u016bdras. Anyone can serve the Supreme Lord by performing his prescribed duties under the direction of a spiritual master, or representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one should think that his prescribed duties are inferior. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a can serve the Lord by using his intelligence, and the k\u1e63atriya can serve the Supreme Lord by using his military arts, just as Arjuna served K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna was a warrior; he had no time to study Ved\u0101nta or other highly intellectual books. The damsels in Vrajadh\u0101ma were girls born of the vai\u015bya class, and they engaged in protecting cows and producing agriculture. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s foster father, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and his associates were all vai\u015byas. They were not at all educated, but they could serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by loving Him and by offering everything to Him. Similarly, there are many instances in which ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las, or those lower than \u015b\u016bdras, have served K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Also, the sage Vidura was considered a \u015b\u016bdra because his mother happened to be a \u015b\u016bdra. There are no distinctions, for it is declared by the Lord in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that anyone engaged specifically in devotional service is elevated to the transcendental position without a doubt. Everyone\u2019s prescribed duty is glorious if it is performed in the devotional service of the Lord, without desire for profit. Such loving service must be performed without reason, without impediment, and spontaneously. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is lovable, and one has to serve Him in whatever capacity one can. That is pure devotional service. Another significant phrase in this verse is n\u0101tihi\u1e41sre\u1e47a, \u201cwith minimum violence or sacrifice of life.\u201d Even if a devotee has to commit violence, it should not be done beyond what is necessary. Sometimes the question is put before us: \u201cYou ask us not to eat meat, but you are eating vegetables. Do you think that is not violence?\u201d The answer is that eating vegetables is violence, and vegetarians are also committing violence against other living entities because vegetables also have life. Nondevotees are killing cows, goats and so many other animals for eating purposes, and a devotee, who is vegetarian, is also killing. But here, significantly, it is stated that every living entity has to live by killing another entity; that is the law of nature. J\u012bvo j\u012bvasya j\u012bvanam: one living entity is the life for another living entity. But for a human being, that violence should be committed only as much as necessary. A human being is not to eat anything which is not offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yaj\u00f1a-\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u015bina\u1e25 santa\u1e25: one becomes freed from all sinful reactions by eating foodstuffs which are offered to Yaj\u00f1a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee therefore eats only pras\u0101da, or foodstuffs offered to the Supreme Lord, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that when a devotee offers Him foodstuffs from the vegetable kingdom, with devotion, He eats that. A devotee is to offer to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a foodstuffs prepared from vegetables. If the Supreme Lord wanted foodstuffs prepared from animal food, the devotee could offer this, but He does not order to do that. We have to commit violence; that is a natural law. We should not, however, commit violence extravagantly, but only as much as ordered by the Lord. Arjuna engaged in the art of killing, and although killing is, of course, violence, he killed the enemy simply on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s order. In the same way, if we commit violence as it is necessary, by the order of the Lord, that is called n\u0101tihi\u1e41s\u0101. We cannot avoid violence, for we are put into a conditional life in which we have to commit violence, but we should not commit more violence than necessary or than ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " Temple worship is one of the duties of a devotee. It is especially recommended for neophytes, but those who are advanced should not refrain from temple worship. There is a distinction in the manner a neophyte and an advanced devotee appreciate the Lord\u2019s presence in the temple. A neophyte considers the arc\u0101-vigraha (the statue of the Lord) to be different from the original Personality of Godhead; he considers it a representation of the Supreme Lord in the form of a Deity. But an advanced devotee accepts the Deity in the temple as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He does not see any difference between the original form of the Lord and the statue, or arc\u0101 form of the Lord, in the temple. This is the vision of a devotee whose devotional service is in the highest stage of bh\u0101va, or love of Godhead, whereas a neophyte\u2019s worship in the temple is a matter of routine duty. Temple Deity worship is one of the functions of a devotee. He goes regularly to see the Deity nicely decorated, and with veneration and respect he touches the lotus feet of the Lord and presents offerings of worship, such as fruits, flowers and prayers. At the same time, to advance in devotional service, a devotee should see other living entities as spiritual sparks, parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. A devotee is to offer respect to every entity that has a relationship with the Lord. Because every living entity originally has a relationship with the Lord as part and parcel, a devotee should try to see all living entities on the same equal level of spiritual existence. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, a pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, one who is learned, sees equally a very learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a \u015b\u016bdra, a hog, a dog and a cow. He does not see the body, which is only an outward dress. He does not see the dress of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or that of a cow or of a hog. He sees the spiritual spark, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. If a devotee does not see every living entity as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, he is considered pr\u0101k\u1e5bta-bhakta, a materialistic devotee. He is not completely situated on the spiritual platform; rather, he is in the lowest stage of devotion. He does, however, show all respect to the Deity. Although a devotee sees all living entities on the level of spiritual existence, he is not interested in associating with everyone. Simply because a tiger is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord does not mean that we embrace him because of his spiritual relationship with the Supreme Lord. We must associate only with persons who have developed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We should befriend and offer special respect to persons who are developed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Other living entities are undoubtedly part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but because their consciousness is still covered and not developed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we should renounce their association. It is said by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura that even if one is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, if he is not of good character his company should be avoided, although he may be offered the respect of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Anyone who accepts Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is accepted as a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, but a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is expected to develop all the good qualities of the demigods. The exact meaning of the word sattvena is given by \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b as being synonymous with dhairye\u1e47a, or patience. One must perform devotional service with great patience. One should not give up the execution of devotional service because one or two attempts have not been successful. One must continue. \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b also confirms that one should be very enthusiastic and execute devotional service with patience and confidence. Patience is necessary for developing the confidence that \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will certainly accept me because I am engaging in devotional service.\u201d One has only to execute service according to the rules and regulations to insure success."

He should be compassionate to the poor and make friendship with persons who are his equals, but all his activities should be executed under regulation and with control of the senses.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Thirteenth Chapter, it is clearly stated that one should execute devotional service and advance on the path of spiritual knowledge by accepting the \u0101c\u0101rya. \u0100c\u0101ryop\u0101sanam: one should worship an \u0101c\u0101rya, a spiritual master who knows things as they are. The spiritual master must be in the disciplic succession from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The predecessors of the spiritual master are his spiritual master, his grand spiritual master, his great-grand spiritual master and so on, who form the disciplic succession of \u0101c\u0101ryas. It is recommended herewith that all the \u0101c\u0101ryas be given the highest respect. It is stated, guru\u1e63u nara-mati\u1e25. Guru\u1e63u means \u201cunto the \u0101c\u0101ryas,\u201d and nara-mati\u1e25 means \u201cthinking like a common man.\u201d To think of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, the devotees, as belonging to a particular caste or community, to think of the \u0101c\u0101ryas as ordinary men, or to think of the Deity in the temple as being made of stone, wood or metal is condemned. Niyamena: one should offer the greatest respect to the \u0101c\u0101ryas according to the standard regulations. A devotee should also be compassionate to the poor. This does not refer to those who are poverty-stricken materially. According to devotional vision, a man is poor if he is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A man may be very rich materially, but if he is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he is considered poor. On the other hand, many \u0101c\u0101ryas, such as R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, used to live beneath trees every night. Superficially it appeared that they were poverty-stricken, but from their writings we can understand that in spiritual life they were the richest personalities. A devotee shows compassion to those poor souls who are wanting in spiritual knowledge by enlightening them in order to elevate them to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is one of the duties of a devotee. He should also make friendship with persons who are on an equal level with himself or who have the same understanding that he does. For a devotee, there is no point in making friendships with ordinary persons; he should make friendship with other devotees so that by discussing among themselves they may elevate one another on the path of spiritual understanding. This is called i\u1e63\u1e6da-go\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 there is reference to bodhayanta\u1e25 parasparam, \u201cdiscussing among themselves.\u201d Generally pure devotees utilize their valuable time in chanting and discussing various activities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Lord Caitanya amongst themselves. There are innumerable books, such as the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Bh\u0101gavatam, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and Upani\u1e63ads, which contain countless subjects for discussion among two devotees or more. Friendship should be cemented between persons with mutual interests and understanding. Such persons are said to be sva j\u0101ti, \u201cof the same caste.\u201d The devotee should avoid a person whose character is not fixed in the standard understanding; even though he may be a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, if his character is not correctly representative, then he should be avoided. One should steadily control the senses and the mind and strictly follow the rules and regulations, and he should make friendship with persons of the same standard."

His behavior should always be straightforward and simple, and although he is not envious but friendly to everyone, he should avoid the company of persons who are not spiritually advanced.",
        "purport": " In order to advance in spiritual understanding, one has to hear from authentic sources about spiritual knowledge. One can understand the reality of spiritual life by following strict regulative principles and by controlling the senses. To have control it is necessary that one be nonviolent and truthful, refrain from stealing, abstain from sex life and possess only that which is absolutely necessary for keeping the body and soul together. One should not eat more than necessary, he should not collect more paraphernalia than necessary, he should not talk unnecessarily with common men, and he should not follow the rules and regulations without purpose. He should follow the rules and regulations so that he may actually make advancement. There are eighteen qualifications mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, among which is simplicity. One should be without pride, one should not demand unnecessary respect from others, and one should be nonviolent (am\u0101nitvam adambhitvam ahi\u1e41s\u0101). One should be very tolerant and simple, one should accept the spiritual master, and one should control the senses. These are mentioned here and in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as well. One should hear from authentic sources how to advance in spiritual life; such instructions should be taken from the \u0101c\u0101rya and should be assimilated. It is especially mentioned here, n\u0101ma-sa\u1e45k\u012brtan\u0101c ca: one should chant the holy names of the Lord \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 either individually or with others. Lord Caitanya has given special stress to chanting of these holy names of the Lord as the basic principle of spiritual advancement. Another word used here is \u0101rjavena, meaning \u201cwithout diplomacy.\u201d A devotee should not make plans out of self-interest. Of course, preachers sometimes have to make some plan to execute the mission of the Lord under proper guidance, but regarding personal self-interest, a devotee should always be without diplomacy, and he should avoid the company of persons who are not advancing in spiritual life. Another word is \u0101rya. \u0100ryans are persons who are advancing in knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as well as in material prosperity. The difference between the \u0100ryan and non-\u0100ryan, the sura and asura, is in their standards of spiritual advancement. Association with persons who are not spiritually advanced is forbidden. Lord Caitanya advised, asat-sa\u1e45ga-ty\u0101ga: one should avoid persons who are attached to the temporary. Asat is one who is too materially attached \u2014 who is not a devotee of the Lord or who is too attached to women or enjoyable material things. Such a person, according to Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy, is a persona non grata. A devotee should not be proud of his acquisitions. The symptoms of a devotee are meekness and humility. Although spiritually very advanced, he will always remain meek and humble, as Kavir\u0101ja Gosv\u0101m\u012b and all the other Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas have taught us by personal example. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu taught that one should be humbler than the grass on the street and more tolerant than the tree. One should not be proud or falsely puffed up. In this way one will surely advance in spiritual life."

        "purport": " It is stated clearly herein that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His plenary expansion of Supersoul, is present in all living entities. The living entities have 8,400,000 different kinds of bodies, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is living in every body both as the individual soul and as the Supersoul. Since the individual soul is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, in that sense the Lord is living in every body, and, as Supersoul, the Lord is also present as a witness. In both cases the presence of God in every living entity is essential. Therefore persons who profess to belong to some religious sect but who do not feel the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living entity, and everywhere else, are in the mode of ignorance. If, without this preliminary knowledge of the Lord\u2019s omnipresence, one simply attaches himself to the rituals in a temple, church or mosque, it is as if he were offering butter into ashes rather than into the fire. One offers sacrifices by pouring clarified butter into a fire and chanting Vedic mantras, but even if there are Vedic mantras and all conditions are favorable, if the clarified butter is poured on ashes, then such a sacrifice will be useless. In other words, a devotee should not ignore any living entity. The devotee must know that in every living entity, however insignificant he may be, even in an ant, God is present, and therefore every living entity should be kindly treated and should not be subjected to any violence. In modern civilized society, slaughterhouses are regularly maintained and supported by a certain type of religious principle. But without knowledge of the presence of God in every living entity, any so-called advancement of human civilization, either spiritual or material, is to be understood as being in the mode of ignorance."

        "purport": " In this verse, two phrases \u2014 bh\u016bte\u1e63u baddha-vairasya (\u201cinimical towards others\u201d) and dvi\u1e63ata\u1e25 para-k\u0101ye (\u201cenvious of another\u2019s body\u201d) \u2014 are significant. One who is envious of or inimical towards others never experiences any happiness. A devotee\u2019s vision, therefore, must be perfect. He should ignore bodily distinctions and should see only the presence of the part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord Himself in His plenary expansion as Supersoul. That is the vision of a pure devotee. The bodily expression of a particular type of living entity is always ignored by the devotee. It is expressed herein that the Lord is always eager to deliver the conditioned souls, who have been encaged within material bodies. Devotees are expected to carry the message or desire of the Lord to such conditioned souls and enlighten them with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Thus they may be elevated to transcendental, spiritual life, and the mission of their lives will be successful. Of course this is not possible for living entities who are lower than human beings, but in human society it is feasible that all living entities can be enlightened with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Even living entities who are lower than human can be raised to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by other methods. For example, \u015aiv\u0101nanda Sena, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, delivered a dog by feeding him pras\u0101da. Distribution of pras\u0101da, or remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, even to the ignorant masses of people and to animals, gives such living entities the chance for elevation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Factually it happened that the same dog, when met by Lord Caitanya at Pur\u012b, was liberated from the material condition. It is especially mentioned here that a devotee must be free from all violence (j\u012bv\u0101hi\u1e41s\u0101). Lord Caitanya has recommended that a devotee not commit violence to any living entity. Sometimes the question is raised that since vegetables also have life and devotees take vegetable foodstuffs, isn\u2019t that violence? Firstly, however, taking some leaves, twigs or fruit from a tree or plant does not kill the plant. Besides that, j\u012bv\u0101hi\u1e41s\u0101 means that since every living entity has to pass through a particular type of body according to his past karma, although every living entity is eternal he should not be disturbed in his gradual evolution. A devotee has to execute the principles of devotional service exactly as they are, and he must know that however insignificant a living entity may be, the Lord is present within him. A devotee must realize this universal presence of the Lord."

It is prescribed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cIf a devotee offers Me a small flower, a leaf, some water or a little fruit, I will accept it.\u201d The real purpose is to exhibit one\u2019s loving devotion to the Lord; the offerings themselves are secondary. If one has not developed loving devotion to the Lord and simply offers many kinds of foodstuffs, fruits and flowers without real devotion, the offering will not be accepted by the Lord. We cannot bribe the Personality of Godhead. He is so great that our bribery has no value. Nor has He any scarcity; since He is full in Himself, what can we offer Him? Everything is produced by Him. We simply offer to show our love and gratitude to the Lord. This gratitude and love for God is exhibited by a pure devotee, who knows that the Lord lives in every living entity. As such, temple worship necessarily includes distribution of pras\u0101da. It is not that one should create a temple in his private apartment or private room, offer something to the Lord, and then eat. Of course, that is better than simply cooking foodstuffs and eating without understanding one\u2019s relationship with the Supreme Lord; people who act in this manner are just like animals. But the devotee who wants to elevate himself to the higher level of understanding must know that the Lord is present in every living entity, and, as stated in the previous verse, one should be compassionate to other living entities. A devotee should worship the Supreme Lord, be friendly to persons who are on the same level and be compassionate to the ignorant. One should exhibit his compassion for ignorant living entities by distributing pras\u0101da. Distribution of pras\u0101da to the ignorant masses of people is essential for persons who make offerings to the Personality of Godhead. Real love and devotion is accepted by the Lord. Many valuable foodstuffs may be presented to a person, but if the person is not hungry, all such offerings are useless for him. Similarly, we may offer many valuable items to the Deity, but if we have no real sense of devotion and no real sense of the Lord\u2019s presence everywhere, then we are lacking in devotional service; in such a state of ignorance, we cannot offer anything acceptable to the Lord."

        "purport": " It should not be misunderstood that because the Supersoul is dwelling within the heart of a living entity, the individual soul has become equal to Him. The equality of the Supersoul and the individual soul is misconceived by the impersonalist. Here it is distinctly mentioned that the individual soul should be recognized in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The method of worshiping the individual soul is described here as either giving charitable gifts or behaving in a friendly manner, free from any separatist outlook. The impersonalist sometimes accepts a poor individual soul as being daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, meaning that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has become poor. This is a contradiction. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full in all opulences. He can agree to live with a poor soul or even with an animal, but this does not make Him poor. There are two Sanskrit words used here, m\u0101na and d\u0101na. M\u0101na indicates a superior, and d\u0101na indicates one who gives charitable gifts or is compassionate towards an inferior. We cannot treat the Supreme Personality of Godhead as an inferior who is dependent on our charitable gifts. When we give charity, it is to a person who is inferior in his material or economic condition. Charity is not given to a rich man. Similarly, it is explicitly stated here that m\u0101na, respect, is offered to a superior, and charity is offered to an inferior. The living entities, according to different results of fruitive activities, may become rich or poor, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unchangeable; He is always full in six opulences. Treating a living entity equally does not mean treating him as one would treat the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Compassion and friendliness do not necessitate falsely elevating someone to the exalted position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We should not, at the same time, misunderstand that the Supersoul situated in the heart of an animal like a hog and the Supersoul situated in the heart of a learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a are different. The Supersoul in all living entities is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His omnipotency, He can live anywhere, and He can create His Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha situation everywhere. That is His inconceivable potency. Therefore, when N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is living in the heart of a hog, He does not become a hog-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. He is always N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and is unaffected by the body of the hog."

        "purport": " In the previous verse it was explained that living entities should be honored by charitable gifts and friendly behavior, and in this verse and in the following verses the description of different grades of living entities is given so that one can know when to behave friendly and when to give charity. For example, a tiger is a living entity, part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the Supreme Lord is living in the heart of the tiger as Supersoul. But does this mean that we have to treat the tiger in a friendly manner? Certainly not. We have to treat him differently, giving him charity in the form of pras\u0101da. The many saintly persons in the jungles do not treat the tigers in a friendly way, but they supply pras\u0101da foodstuffs to them. The tigers come, take the food and go away, just as a dog does. According to the Vedic system, a dog is not allowed to enter the house. Because of their uncleanliness, cats and dogs are not allowed within the apartment of a gentleman, but are so trained that they stand outside. The compassionate householder will supply pras\u0101da to the dogs and cats, who eat outside and then go away. We must treat the lower living entities compassionately, but this does not mean that we have to treat them in the same way we treat other human beings. The feeling of equality must be there, but the treatment should be discriminating. Just how discrimination should be maintained is given in the following six verses concerning the different grades of living conditions. The first division is made between dead, stonelike matter and the living organism. A living organism is sometimes manifested even in stone. Experience shows that some hills and mountains grow. This is due to the presence of the soul within that stone. Above that, the next manifestation of the living condition is development of consciousness, and the next manifestation is the development of sense perception. In the Mok\u1e63a-dharma section of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata it is stated that trees have developed sense perception; they can see and smell. We know by experience that trees can see. Sometimes in its growth a large tree changes its course of development to avoid some hindrances. This means that a tree can see, and according to Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, a tree can also smell. This indicates the development of sense perception."

The development of the evolutionary process was known long before from the Bh\u0101gavatam, which was written five thousand years ago. There are records of the statements of Kapila Muni, who was present almost in the beginning of the creation. This knowledge has existed since the Vedic time, and all these sequences are disclosed in Vedic literature; the theory of gradual evolution or anthropology is not new to the Vedas. It is said here that amongst the trees there are also evolutionary processes; the different kinds of trees have touch perception. It is said that better than the trees are the fish because fish have developed the sense of taste. Better than the fish are the bees, who have developed the sense of smell, and better than them are the serpents because serpents have developed the sense of hearing. In the darkness of night a snake can find its eatables simply by hearing the frog\u2019s very pleasant cry. The snake can understand, \u201cThere is the frog,\u201d and he captures the frog simply because of its sound vibration. This example is sometimes given for persons who vibrate sounds simply for death. One may have a very nice tongue that can vibrate sound like the frogs, but that kind of vibration is simply calling death. The best use of the tongue and of sound vibration is to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare.

Unless there is such a division of the social orders in human society, including the intelligent class, the martial class, the mercantile class and the laborer class, there is always confusion as to who is to work for what purpose.

For example, Lord Caitanya, in the role of a devotee, also preached the same philosophy. He preached that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the worshipful Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that the interest of His pure devotees is the same as His own. Sometimes M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, due to a poor fund of knowledge, define the word sama-dar\u015ban\u0101t to mean that a devotee should see himself as one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is foolishness. When one thinks himself one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question of serving Him. When there is service, there must be a master. Three things must be present for there to be service: the master, the servant and the service. Here it is clearly stated that he who has dedicated his life, all his activities, his mind and his soul \u2014 everything \u2014 for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, is considered to be the greatest person. The word akartu\u1e25 means \u201cwithout any sense of proprietorship.\u201d Everyone wants to act as the proprietor of his actions so that he can enjoy the result. A devotee, however, has no such desire; he acts because the Personality of Godhead wants him to act in a particular way. He has no personal motive. When Lord Caitanya preached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it was not with the purpose that people would call Him K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; rather, He preached that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should be worshiped as such. A devotee who is a most confidential servant of the Lord never does anything for his personal account, but does everything for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is clearly stated, mayi sannyasta-karma\u1e47a\u1e25: the devotee works, but he works for the Supreme. It is also stated, mayy arpit\u0101tmana\u1e25: \u201cHe gives his mind unto Me.\u201d These are the qualifications of a devotee, who, according to this verse, is accepted as the highest of all human beings."

        "translation": "My dear mother, O daughter of Manu, a devotee who applies the science of devotional service and mystic yoga in this way can achieve the abode of the Supreme Person simply by that devotional service.",
        "purport": " Herein the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapiladeva perfectly explains that the mystic yoga system, consisting of eight different kinds of yoga activities, has to be performed with the aim of coming to the perfectional stage of bhakti-yoga. It is not acceptable for one to be satisfied simply by practicing the sitting postures and thinking himself complete. By meditation one must attain the stage of devotional service. As previously described, a yog\u012b is advised to meditate on the form of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u from point to point, from the ankles to the legs to the knees to the thighs to the chest to the neck, and in this way gradually up to the face and then to the ornaments. There is no question of impersonal meditation. When, by meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead in all detail, one comes to the point of love of God, that is the point of bhakti-yoga, and at that point he must actually render service to the Lord out of transcendental love. Anyone who practices yoga and comes to the point of devotional service can attain the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental abode. Here it is clearly stated, puru\u1e63a\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 vrajet: the puru\u1e63a, the living entity, goes to the Supreme Person. The Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity are qualitatively one; both are defined as puru\u1e63a. The quality of puru\u1e63a exists both in the Supreme Godhead and in the living entity. Puru\u1e63a means \u201cenjoyer,\u201d and the spirit of enjoyment is present both in the living entity and in the Supreme Lord. The difference is that the quantity of enjoyment is not equal. The living entity cannot experience the same quantity of enjoyment as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. An analogy may be made with a rich man and a poor man: the propensity for enjoyment is present in both, but the poor man cannot enjoy in the same quantity as the rich man. When the poor man dovetails his desires with those of the rich man, however, and when there is cooperation between the poor man and the rich man, or between the big and the small man, then the enjoyment is shared equally. That is like bhakti-yoga. Puru\u1e63a\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 vrajet: when the living entity enters into the kingdom of God and cooperates with the Supreme Lord by giving Him enjoyment, he enjoys the same facility or the same amount of pleasure as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. On the other hand, when the living entity wants to enjoy by imitating the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his desire is called m\u0101y\u0101, and it puts him in the material atmosphere. A living entity who wants to enjoy on his personal account and not cooperate with the Supreme Lord is engaged in materialistic life. As soon as he dovetails his enjoyment with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is engaged in spiritual life. An example may be cited here: The different limbs of the body cannot enjoy life independently; they must cooperate with the whole body and supply food to the stomach. In so doing, all the different parts of the body enjoy equally in cooperation with the whole body. That is the philosophy of acintya-bhed\u0101bheda, simultaneous oneness and difference. The living entity cannot enjoy life in opposition to the Supreme Lord; he has to dovetail his activities with the Lord by practicing bhakti-yoga. It is said herein that one can approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead by either the yoga process or the bhakti-yoga process. This indicates that factually there is no difference between yoga and bhakti-yoga because the target of both is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the modern age, however, a yoga process has been manufactured which aims at something void and impersonal. Actually, yoga means meditation on the form of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. If the yoga practice is actually performed according to the standard direction, there is no difference between yoga and bhakti-yoga."

Similarly, everything is changed and transformed by the time factor, or by the indirect control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Usually, we do not see any difference between the body of a child and the body of a boy or young man because we know that these changes are due to the action of the time factor.

From His abdomen a lotus flower has grown, and within the stem of that lotus flower all the different planets exist. The material scientist explains that all these different planets are floating because of the law of gravity or some other law; but the actual lawmaker is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When we speak of law, we must understand that there must be a lawmaker. The material scientists can discover laws of nature, but they are unable to recognize the lawmaker. From \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can know who the lawmaker is: the lawmaker is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said here that the planets do not sink. Since they are floating under the order or energy of the Supreme Godhead, they do not fall down into the water which covers half the universe. All the planets are heavy, with their various mountains, seas, oceans, cities, palaces and buildings, and yet they are floating. It is understood from this passage that all the other planets that are floating in the air have oceans and mountains similar to those on this planet."

Similarly, there are many other demigods in charge of the air department, the water department, the cloud department, etc. Just as the government has many different departments, so, within this material world, the government of the Supreme Lord has many departments, and all these departments function in proper order out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Demigods are undoubtedly controlling all matter, animate and inanimate, within the universe, but above them the supreme controller is the Personality of Godhead. Therefore in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said, \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. Undoubtedly there are many controllers in the departmental management of this universe, but the supreme controller is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are two kinds of dissolutions. One kind of dissolution takes place when Brahm\u0101 goes to sleep during his night, and the final dissolution takes place when Brahm\u0101 dies. As long as Brahm\u0101 does not die, creation, maintenance and destruction are actuated by different demigods under the superintendence of the Supreme Lord."
