As stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam, the object of devotional service is m\u0101m, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And, as explained in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His personal form with His internal energy, His external energy, His expansions and His incarnations. There are many diverse departments of knowledge in understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is especially meant for persons who are conditioned by this material world. It is generally understood by the parampar\u0101 system, or by disciplic succession, to be the science of devotional service. Preliminary studies of devotional service have already been explained. Now the analytical study of devotional service will be explained by the Lord, who says that by such an analytical study, one becomes freed from the modes of material nature. The same assertion is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Tato m\u0101\u1e41 tattvato j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101: by understanding the Lord according to various categories, one can become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God. This is also explained here. By understanding the science of devotional service in S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, one can become free from the modes of material nature. The eternal self, after becoming freed from the spell of material nature, becomes eligible to enter into the kingdom of God. As long as one has even a slight desire to enjoy or lord it over material nature, there is no chance of his being freed from the influence of nature\u2019s material modes. Therefore, one has to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead analytically, as explained in the S\u0101\u1e45khya system of philosophy by Lord Kapiladeva."

        "purport": " It is said that by proper understanding of the pure self, or by self-realization, one can be freed from material attachment. Knowledge leads one to attain the ultimate perfection of life and to see oneself as he is. The \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.8) also confirms this. Tam eva viditv\u0101ti-m\u1e5btyum eti: simply by understanding one\u2019s spiritual position, or by seeing oneself as he is, one can be freed from material entanglement. In various ways, the seeing of oneself is described in the Vedic literatures, and it is confirmed in the Bh\u0101gavatam (puru\u1e63asya \u0101tma-dar\u015banam) that one has to see oneself and know what he is. As Kapiladeva explains to His mother, this \u201cseeing\u201d can be done by hearing from the proper authoritative source. Kapiladeva is the greatest authority because He is the Personality of Godhead, and if someone accepts whatever is explained as it is, without interpretation, then he can see himself. Lord Caitanya explained to San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b the real constitutional position of the individual. He said directly that each and every individual soul is eternally a servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. J\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa\u2019: every individual soul is eternally a servitor. When one is fixed in the understanding that he is part and parcel of the Supreme Soul and that his eternal position is to serve in association with the Supreme Lord, he becomes self-realized. This position of rightly understanding oneself cuts the knot of material attraction (h\u1e5bdaya-granthi-bhedanam). Due to false ego, or false identification of oneself with the body and the material world, one is entrapped by m\u0101y\u0101, but as soon as one understands that he is qualitatively the same substance as the Supreme Lord because he belongs to the same category of spirit soul, and that his perpetual position is to serve, one attains \u0101tma-dar\u015banam and h\u1e5bdaya-granthi-bhedanam, self-realization. When one can cut the knot of attachment to the material world, his understanding is called knowledge. \u0100tma-dar\u015banam means to see oneself by knowledge; therefore, when one is freed from the false ego by the cultivation of real knowledge, he sees himself, and that is the ultimate necessity of human life. The soul is thus isolated from the entanglement of the twenty-four categories of material nature. Pursuit of the systematic philosophic process called S\u0101\u1e45khya is called knowledge and self-revelation."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Soul, and He has no beginning. He is transcendental to the material modes of nature and beyond the existence of this material world. He is perceivable everywhere because He is self-effulgent, and by His self-effulgent luster the entire creation is maintained.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as being without beginning. He is puru\u1e63a, the Supreme Spirit. Puru\u1e63a means \u201cperson.\u201d When we think of a person in our present experience, that person has a beginning. This means that he has taken birth and that there is a history from the beginning of his life. But the Lord is particularly mentioned here as an\u0101di, beginningless. If we examine all persons, we will find that everyone has a beginning, but when we approach a person who has no beginning, He is the Supreme Person. That is the definition given in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme controller; He is without beginning, and He is the beginning of everyone. This definition is found in all Vedic literatures. The Lord is described as the soul, or spirit. What is the definition of spirit? Spirit is perceivable everywhere. Brahman means \u201cgreat.\u201d His greatness is perceived everywhere. And what is that greatness? Consciousness. We have personal experience of consciousness, for it is spread all over the body; in every hair follicle of our body we can feel consciousness. This is individual consciousness. Similarly, there is superconsciousness. The example can be given of a small light and the sunlight. The sunlight is perceived everywhere, even within the room or in the sky, but the small light is experienced within a specific limit. Similarly, our consciousness is perceived within the limit of our particular body, but the superconsciousness, or the existence of God, is perceived everywhere. He is present everywhere by His energy. It is stated in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a that whatever we find, anywhere and everywhere, is the distribution of the energy of the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also it is confirmed that the Lord is all-pervading and exists everywhere by His two kinds of energy, one spiritual and the other material. Both the spiritual and material energies are spread everywhere, and that is the proof of the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The existence of consciousness everywhere is not temporary. It is without beginning, and because it is without beginning, it is also without end. The theory that consciousness develops at a certain stage of material combination is not accepted herein, for the consciousness which exists everywhere is said to be without beginning. The materialistic or atheistic theory stating that there is no soul, that there is no God and that consciousness is the result of a combination of matter is not acceptable. Matter is not beginningless; it has a beginning. As this material body has a beginning, the universal body does also. And as our material body has begun on the basis of our soul, the entire gigantic universal body has begun on the basis of the Supreme Soul. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra says, janm\u0101dy asya. This entire material exhibition \u2014 its creation, its growth, its maintenance and its dissolution \u2014 is an emanation from the Supreme Person. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also, the Lord says, \u201cI am the beginning, the source of birth of everything.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described here. He is not a temporary person, nor does He have a beginning. He is without a cause, and He is the cause of all causes. Para\u1e25 means \u201ctranscendental, beyond the creative energy.\u201d The Lord is the creator of the creative energy. We can see that there is a creative energy in the material world, but He is not under this energy. He is prak\u1e5bti-para\u1e25, beyond this energy. He is not subjected to the threefold miseries created by the material energy because He is beyond it. The modes of material nature do not touch Him. It is explained here, svaya\u1e41-jyoti\u1e25: He is light Himself. We have experience in the material world of one light\u2019s being a reflection of another, just as moonlight is a reflection of the sunlight. Sunlight is also the reflection of the brahmajyoti. Similarly, brahmajyoti, the spiritual effulgence, is a reflection of the body of the Supreme Lord. This is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: yasya prabh\u0101 prabhavata\u1e25. The brahmajyoti, or Brahman effulgence, is due to His bodily luster. Therefore it is said here, svaya\u1e41-jyoti\u1e25: He Himself is light. His light is distributed in different ways, as the brahmajyoti, as sunlight and as moonlight. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunlight, moonlight or electricity. The Upani\u1e63ads also confirm this; because the bodily luster of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is sufficient to illuminate the spiritual world, there is no need of sunlight, moonlight or any other light or electricity. This self-illumination also contradicts the theory that the spirit soul, or the spiritual consciousness, develops at a certain point in material combination. The term svaya\u1e41-jyoti\u1e25 indicates that there is no tinge of anything material or any material reaction. It is confirmed here that the concept of the Lord\u2019s all-pervasiveness is due to His illumination everywhere. We have experience that the sun is situated in one place, but the sunlight is diffused all around for millions and millions of miles. That is our practical experience. Similarly, although the supreme light is situated in His personal abode, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha or V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, His light is diffused not only in the spiritual world but beyond that. In the material world also, that light is reflected by the sun globe, and the sunlight is reflected by the moon globe. Thus although He is situated in His own abode, His light is distributed all over the spiritual and material worlds. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37) confirms this. Goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25: He is living in Goloka, but still He is present all over the creation. He is the Supersoul of everything, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has innumerable transcendental qualities. It is also concluded that although He is undoubtedly a person, He is not a puru\u1e63a of this material world. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers cannot understand that beyond this material world there can be a person; therefore they are impersonalists. But it is explained very nicely here that the Personality of Godhead is beyond material existence."

        "translation": "As His pastime, that Supreme Personality of Godhead, the greatest of the great, accepted the subtle material energy, which is invested with three material modes of nature and which is related with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word gu\u1e47a-may\u012bm is very significant. Daiv\u012bm means \u201cthe energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\u201d and gu\u1e47a-may\u012bm means \u201cinvested with the three modes of material nature.\u201d When the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, this gu\u1e47a-may\u012bm energy acts as a manifestation of the energies of the three modes; it acts as a covering. The energy emanated from the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests in two ways \u2014 as an emanation from the Supreme Lord and as a covering of the Lord\u2019s face. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that because the whole world is illusioned by the three modes of material nature, the common conditioned soul, being covered by such energy, cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example of a cloud is very nicely given. All of a sudden there may appear a big cloud in the sky. This cloud is perceived in two ways. To the sun the cloud is a creation of its energy, but to the ordinary common man in the conditioned state, it is a covering to the eyes; because of the cloud, the sun cannot be seen. It is not that the sun is actually covered by the cloud; only the vision of the ordinary being is covered. Similarly, although m\u0101y\u0101 cannot cover the Supreme Lord, who is beyond m\u0101y\u0101, the material energy covers the ordinary living entities. Those conditioned souls who are covered are individual living entities, and He from whose energy m\u0101y\u0101 is created is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In another place in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, in the First Canto, Seventh Chapter, it is stated that Vy\u0101sadeva, by his spiritual vision, saw the Supreme Lord and the material energy standing behind Him. This indicates that material energy cannot cover the Lord, just as darkness cannot cover the sun. Darkness can cover a jurisdiction which is very insignificant in comparison to that of the sun. Darkness can cover a small cave, but not the open sky. Similarly, the covering capacity of the material energy is limited and cannot act on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is therefore called vibhu. As the appearance of a cloud is accepted by the sun, so the appearance of the material energy at a certain interval is accepted by the Lord. Although His material energy is utilized to create the material world, this does not mean that He is covered by that energy. Those who are covered by the material energy are called conditioned souls. The Lord accepts the material energy for His material pastimes in creation, maintenance and dissolution. But the conditioned soul is covered; he cannot understand that beyond this material energy there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the cause of all causes, just as a less intelligent person cannot understand that beyond the covering of the clouds there is bright sunshine."

        "translation": "Divided into varieties by her threefold modes, material nature creates the forms of the living entities, and the living entities, seeing this, are illusioned by the knowledge-covering feature of the illusory energy.",
        "purport": " Material energy has the power to cover knowledge, but this covering cannot be applied to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is applicable only to the praj\u0101\u1e25, or those who are born with material bodies, the conditioned souls. The different kinds of living entities vary according to the modes of material nature, as explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and other Vedic literature. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.12) it is very nicely explained that although the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance are born of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is not subject to them. In other words, the energy emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot act on Him; it acts on the conditioned souls, who are covered by the material energy. The Lord is the father of all living entities because He impregnates material energy with the conditioned souls. Therefore, the conditioned souls get bodies created by the material energy, whereas the father of the living entities is aloof from the three modes. It is stated in the previous verse that the material energy was accepted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order that He might exhibit pastimes for the living entities who wanted to enjoy and lord it over the material energy. This world was created through the material energy of the Lord for the so-called enjoyment of such living entities. Why this material world was created for the sufferings of the conditioned souls is a very intricate question. There is a hint in the previous verse in the word l\u012blay\u0101, which means \u201cfor the pastimes of the Lord.\u201d The Lord wants to rectify the enjoying temperament of the conditioned souls. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that no one is the enjoyer but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This material energy is therefore created for anyone who pretends to enjoy. An example can be cited here that there is no necessity for the government\u2019s creation of a separate police department, but because it is a fact that some of the citizens will not accept the state laws, a department to deal with criminals is necessary. There is no necessity, but at the same time there is a necessity. Similarly, there was no necessity to create this material world for the sufferings of the conditioned souls, but at the same time there are certain living entities, known as nitya-baddha, who are eternally conditioned. We say that they have been conditioned from time immemorial because no one can trace out when the living entity, the part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, became rebellious against the supremacy of the Lord. It is a fact that there are two classes of men \u2014 those who are obedient to the laws of the Supreme Lord and those who are atheists or agnostics, who do not accept the existence of God and who want to create their own laws. They want to establish that everyone can create his own laws or his own religious path. Without tracing out the beginning of the existence of these two classes, we can take it for granted that some of the living entities revolted against the laws of the Lord. Such entities are called conditioned souls, for they are conditioned by the three modes of material nature. Therefore the words gu\u1e47air vicitr\u0101\u1e25 are used here. In this material world there are 8,400,000 species of life. As spirit souls, they are all transcendental to this material world. Why, then, do they exhibit themselves in different stages of life? The answer is given here: they are under the spell of the three modes of material nature. Because they were created by the material energy, their bodies are made of the material elements. Covered by the material body, the spiritual identity is lost, and therefore the word mumuhe is used here, indicating that they have forgotten their own spiritual identity. This forgetfulness of spiritual identity is present in the j\u012bvas, or souls, who are conditioned, being subject to be covered by the energy of material nature. J\u00f1\u0101na-g\u016bhay\u0101 is another word used. G\u016bh\u0101 means \u201ccovering.\u201d Because the knowledge of the minute conditioned souls is covered, they are exhibited in so many species of life. It is said in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, First Canto, Seventh Chapter: \u201cThe living entities are illusioned by the material energy.\u201d In the Vedas also it is stated that the eternal living entities are covered by different modes and that they are called tricolored \u2014 red, white and blue \u2014 living entities. Red is the representation of the mode of passion, white is the representation of the mode of goodness, and blue is the representation of the mode of ignorance. These modes of material nature belong to the material energy, and therefore the living entities under these different modes of material nature have different kinds of material bodies. Because they are forgetful of their spiritual identities, they think the material bodies to be themselves. To the conditioned soul, \u201cme\u201d means the material body. This is called moha, or bewilderment. It is repeatedly said in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is never affected by the influence of material nature. It is, rather, the conditioned souls, or the minute infinitesimal parts and parcels of the Supreme, who are affected by the influence of material nature and who appear in different bodies under the material modes."

But the word \u201cpastime\u201d implies employment in the activities of the Lord. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs misuse the word and say that even if the living entity has become a stool-eating hog, he is also enjoying his pastimes. This is a most dangerous interpretation. Actually the Supreme Lord is the leader and maintainer of all living entities. His pastimes are transcendental to any material activity. Such pastimes of the Lord cannot be dragged to the level of the conditional activities of the living entities. In conditional life the living entity actually remains as if a captive in the hands of material energy. Whatever the material energy dictates, the conditioned soul does. He has no responsibility; he is simply the witness of the action, but he is forced to act in that way due to his offense in his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that m\u0101y\u0101, His material energy, is so forceful that it is insurmountable. But if a living entity simply understands that his constitutional position is to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and he tries to act on this principle, then however conditioned he may be, the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 immediately vanishes. This is clearly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Seventh Chapter: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a takes charge of anyone who surrenders to Him in helplessness, and thus the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, or conditional life, is removed. The spirit soul is actually sac-cid-\u0101nanda \u2014 eternal, full of bliss and full of knowledge. Under the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, however, he suffers from continued birth, death, disease and old age. One has to be serious to cure this condition of material existence and transfer himself to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for thus his long suffering may be mitigated without difficulty. In summary, the suffering of the conditioned soul is due to his attachment to material nature. This attachment should thus be transferred from matter to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that when the Lord descends to this material world, He comes as a person by His own energy, \u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101. He is not forced by any superior energy. He comes by His own will, and this can be called His pastime, or l\u012bl\u0101. But here it is clearly stated that the conditioned soul is forced to take a certain type of body and senses under the three modes of material nature. That body is not received according to his own choice. In other words, a conditioned soul has no free choice; he has to accept a certain type of body according to his karma. But when there are bodily reactions as felt in happiness and distress, it is to be understood that the cause is the spirit soul himself. If he so desires, the spirit soul can change this conditional life of dualities by choosing to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The living entity is the cause of his own suffering, but he can also be the cause of his eternal happiness. When he wants to engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, a suitable body is offered to him by the internal potency, the spiritual energy of the Lord, and when he wants to satisfy his senses, a material body is offered. Thus it is his free choice to accept a spiritual body or a material body, but once the body is accepted he has to enjoy or suffer the consequences. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosopher\u2019s presentation is that the living entity enjoys his pastimes by accepting the body of a hog. This theory is not acceptable, however, because the word \u201cpastime\u201d implies voluntary acceptance for enjoyment. Therefore this interpretation is most misleading. When there is enforced acceptance for suffering, it is not a pastime. The Lord\u2019s pastimes and the conditioned living entity\u2019s acceptance of karmic reaction are not on the same level."

        "translation": "Devah\u016bti said: O Supreme Personality of Godhead, kindly explain the characteristics of the Supreme Person and His energies, for both of these are the causes of this manifest and unmanifest creation.",
        "purport": " Prak\u1e5bti, or material nature, is connected with both the Supreme Lord and the living entities, just as a woman is connected with her husband as a wife and with her children as a mother. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that He impregnates mother nature with children, living entities, and thereafter all species of living entities become manifest. The relationship of all living entities with material nature has been explained. Now an understanding of the relationship between material nature and the Supreme Lord is sought by Devah\u016bti. The product of that relationship is stated to be the manifest and unmanifest material world. The unmanifest material world is the subtle mahat-tattva, and from that mahat-tattva the material manifestation has emerged. In the Vedic literatures it is said that by the glance of the Supreme Lord the total material energy is impregnated, and then everything is born of material nature. It is also confirmed in the Ninth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that under His glance, adhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a \u2014 under His direction and by His will \u2014 nature is working. It is not that nature works blindly. After understanding the position of the conditioned souls in relation to material nature, Devah\u016bti wanted to know how nature works under the direction of the Lord and what the relationship is between the material nature and the Lord. In other words, she wanted to learn the characteristics of the Supreme Lord in relation to the material nature. The relationship of the living entities with matter and that of the Supreme Lord with matter are certainly not on the same level, although the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs may interpret it in that way. When it is said that the living entities are bewildered, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers ascribe this bewilderment to the Supreme Lord. But that is not applicable. The Lord is never bewildered. That is the difference between personalists and impersonalists. Devah\u016bti is not unintelligent. She has enough intelligence to understand that the living entities are not on the level of the Supreme Lord. Because the living entities are infinitesimal, they become bewildered or conditioned by material nature, but this does not mean that the Supreme Lord is also conditioned or bewildered. The difference between the conditioned soul and the Lord is that the Lord is the Lord, the master of material nature, and He is therefore not subject to its control. He is controlled neither by spiritual nature nor by material nature. He is the supreme controller Himself, and He cannot be compared to the ordinary living entities, who are controlled by the laws of material nature. Two words used in this verse are sat and asat. The cosmic manifestation is asat \u2014 it does not exist \u2014 but the material energy of the Supreme Lord is sat, or ever existing. Material nature is ever existing in its subtle form as the energy of the Lord, but it sometimes manifests this nonexistent or temporarily existent nature, the cosmos. An analogy may be made with the father and mother: the mother and the father exist, but sometimes the mother begets children. Similarly, this cosmic manifestation, which comes from the unmanifest material nature of the Supreme Lord, sometimes appears and again disappears. But the material nature is ever existing, and the Lord is the supreme cause for both the subtle and gross manifestations of this material world."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The unmanifested eternal combination of the three modes is the cause of the manifest state and is called pradh\u0101na. It is called prak\u1e5bti when in the manifested stage of existence.",
        "purport": " The Lord points out material nature in its subtle stage, which is called pradh\u0101na, and He analyzes this pradh\u0101na. The explanation of pradh\u0101na and prak\u1e5bti is that pradh\u0101na is the subtle, undifferentiated sum total of all material elements. Although they are undifferentiated, one can understand that the total material elements are contained therein. When the total material elements are manifested by the interaction of the three modes of material nature, the manifestation is called prak\u1e5bti. Impersonalists say that Brahman is without variegatedness and without differentiation. One may say that pradh\u0101na is the Brahman stage, but actually the Brahman stage is not pradh\u0101na. Pradh\u0101na is distinct from Brahman because in Brahman there is no existence of the material modes of nature. One may argue that the mahat-tattva is also different from pradh\u0101na because in the mahat-tattva there are manifestations. The actual explanation of pradh\u0101na, however, is given here: when the cause and effect are not clearly manifested (avyakta), the reaction of the total elements does not take place, and that stage of material nature is called pradh\u0101na. Pradh\u0101na is not the time element because in the time element there are actions and reactions, creation and annihilation. Nor is it the j\u012bva, or marginal potency of living entities, or designated, conditioned living entities, because the designations of the living entities are not eternal. One adjective used in this connection is nitya, which indicates eternality. Therefore the condition of material nature immediately previous to its manifestation is called pradh\u0101na."

Actually there is no death for the spirit soul, but due to our absorption in the identification of body as self, the fear of death develops. It is also stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.2.37), bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101t. Dvit\u012bya refers to matter, which is beyond spirit. Matter is the secondary manifestation of spirit, for matter is produced from spirit. Just as the material elements described are caused by the Supreme Lord, or the Supreme Spirit, the body is also a product of the spirit soul. Therefore, the material body is called dvit\u012bya, or \u201cthe second.\u201d One who is absorbed in this second element or second exhibition of the spirit is afraid of death. When one is fully convinced that he is not his body, there is no question of fearing death, since the spirit soul does not die. If the spirit soul engages in the spiritual activities of devotional service, he is completely freed from the platform of birth and death. His next position is complete spiritual freedom from a material body. The fear of death is the action of the k\u0101la, or the time factor, which represents the influence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, time is destructive. Whatever is created is subject to destruction and dissolution, which is the action of time. Time is a representation of the Lord, and it reminds us also that we must surrender unto the Lord. The Lord speaks to every conditioned soul as time. He says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that if someone surrenders unto Him, then there is no longer any problem of birth and death. We should therefore accept the time factor as the Supreme Personality of Godhead standing before us. This is further explained in the following verse."

The Lord says that when the unmanifested material nature is agitated by the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it begins to manifest itself in different ways. Before this agitation, it remains in the neutral state, without interaction by the three modes of material nature. In other words, material nature cannot produce any variety of manifestations without the contact of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is very nicely explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of the products of material nature. Without His contact, material nature cannot produce anything. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta also, a very suitable example is given in this connection. Although the nipples on a goat\u2019s neck appear to be breast nipples, they do not give milk. Similarly, material nature appears to the material scientist to act and react in a wonderful manner, but in reality it cannot act without the agitator, time, who is the representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When time agitates the neutral state of material nature, material nature begins to produce varieties of manifestations. Ultimately it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of creation. As a woman cannot produce children unless impregnated by a man, material nature cannot produce or manifest anything unless it is impregnated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form of the time factor."

        "translation": "By exhibiting His potencies, the Supreme Personality of Godhead adjusts all these different elements, keeping Himself within as the Supersoul and without as time.",
        "purport": " Here it is stated that within the heart the Supreme Personality of Godhead resides as the Supersoul. This situation is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: the Supersoul rests beside the individual soul and acts as a witness. This is also confirmed elsewhere in the Vedic literature: two birds are sitting on the same tree of the body; one is witnessing, and the other is eating the fruits of the tree. This puru\u1e63a, or Param\u0101tm\u0101, who resides within the body of the individual soul, is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.23) as the upadra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101, witness, and the anumant\u0101, sanctioning authority. The conditioned soul engages in the happiness and distress of the particular body given him by the arrangement of the external energy of the Supreme Lord. But the supreme living being, or the Param\u0101tm\u0101, is different from the conditioned soul. He is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as mahe\u015bvara, or the Supreme Lord. He is Param\u0101tm\u0101, not j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101. Param\u0101tm\u0101 means the Supersoul, who is sitting by the side of the conditioned soul just to sanction his activities. The conditioned soul comes to this material world in order to lord it over material nature. Since one cannot do anything without the sanction of the Supreme Lord, He lives with the j\u012bva soul as witness and sanction-giver. He is also bhokt\u0101; He gives maintenance and sustenance to the conditioned soul. Since the living entity is constitutionally part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord is very affectionate to the living entities. Unfortunately, when the living entity is bewildered or illusioned by the external energy, he becomes forgetful of his eternal relationship with the Lord, but as soon as he becomes aware of his constitutional position, he is liberated. The minute independence of the conditioned soul is exhibited by his marginal position. If he likes, he can forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead and come into the material existence with a false ego to lord it over material nature, but if he likes he can turn his face to the service of the Lord. The individual living entity is given that independence. His conditional life is ended and his life becomes successful as soon as he turns his face to the Lord, but by misusing his independence he enters into material existence. Yet the Lord is so kind that, as Supersoul, He always remains with the conditioned soul. The concern of the Lord is neither to enjoy nor to suffer from the material body. He remains with the j\u012bva simply as sanction-giver and witness so that the living entity can receive the results of his activities, good or bad. Outside the body of the conditioned soul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead remains as the time factor. According to the S\u0101\u1e45khya system of philosophy, there are twenty-five elements. The twenty-four elements already described plus the time factor make twenty-five. According to some learned philosophers, the Supersoul is included to make a total of twenty-six elements."

        "purport": " This impregnation of material nature is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Fourteenth Chapter, verse 3. Material nature\u2019s primal factor is the mahat-tattva, or breeding source of all varieties. This part of material nature, which is called pradh\u0101na as well as Brahman, is impregnated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and delivers varieties of living entities. Material nature in this connection is called Brahman because it is a perverted reflection of the spiritual nature. It is described in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a that the living entities belong to the spiritual nature. The potency of the Supreme Lord is spiritual, and the living entities, although they are called marginal potency, are also spiritual. If the living entities were not spiritual, this description of impregnation by the Supreme Lord would not be applicable. The Supreme Lord does not put His semen into that which is not spiritual, but it is stated here that the Supreme Person puts His semen into material nature. This means that the living entities are spiritual by nature. After impregnation, material nature delivers all kinds of living entities, beginning from the greatest living creature, Lord Brahm\u0101, down to the insignificant ant, in all varieties of form. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.4) material nature is clearly mentioned as sarva-yoni\u1e63u. This means that of all varieties of species \u2014 demigods, human beings, animals, birds and beasts (whatever is manifested) \u2014 material nature is the mother, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the seed-giving father. Generally it is experienced that the father gives life to the child but the mother gives its body; although the seed of life is given by the father, the body develops within the womb of the mother. Similarly, the spiritual living entities are impregnated into the womb of material nature, but the body, being supplied by material nature, takes on many different species and forms of life. The theory that the symptoms of life are manifest by the interaction of the twenty-four material elements is not supported here. The living force comes directly from the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is completely spiritual. Therefore, no material scientific advancement can produce life. The living force comes from the spiritual world and has nothing to do with the interaction of the material elements."

        "translation": "The mode of goodness, which is the clear, sober status of understanding the Personality of Godhead and which is generally called v\u0101sudeva, or consciousness, becomes manifest in the mahat-tattva.",
        "purport": " The v\u0101sudeva manifestation, or the status of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is called pure goodness, or \u015buddha-sattva. In the \u015buddha-sattva status there is no infringement of the other qualities, namely passion and ignorance. In the Vedic literature there is mention of the Lord\u2019s expansion as the four Personalities of Godhead \u2014 V\u0101sudeva, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Here in the reappearance of the mahat-tattva the four expansions of Godhead occur. He who is seated within as Supersoul expands first as V\u0101sudeva. The v\u0101sudeva stage is free from infringement by material desires and is the status in which one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the objective which is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as adbhuta. This is another feature of the mahat-tattva. The v\u0101sudeva expansion is also called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for it is free from all tinges of material passion and ignorance. This clear state of understanding helps one to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The v\u0101sudeva status is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a, which refers to the knower of the field of activities as well as the Superknower. The living being who has occupied a particular type of body knows that body, but the Superknower, V\u0101sudeva, knows not only a particular type of body but also the field of activities in all the different varieties of bodies. In order to be situated in clear consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one must worship V\u0101sudeva. V\u0101sudeva is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a alone. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is alone, without the accompaniment of His internal energy, He is V\u0101sudeva. When He is accompanied by His internal potency, He is called Dv\u0101rak\u0101dh\u012b\u015ba. To have clear consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to worship V\u0101sudeva. It is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that after many, many births one surrenders to V\u0101sudeva. Such a great soul is very rare. In order to get release from the false ego, one has to worship Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a is also worshiped through Lord \u015aiva; the snakes which cover the body of Lord \u015aiva are representations of Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, and Lord \u015aiva is always absorbed in meditation upon Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. One who is actually a worshiper of Lord \u015aiva as a devotee of Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a can be released from false, material ego. If one wants to get free from mental disturbances, one has to worship Aniruddha. For this purpose, worship of the moon planet is also recommended in the Vedic literature. Similarly, to be fixed in one\u2019s intelligence one has to worship Pradyumna, who is reached through the worship of Brahm\u0101. These matters are explained in Vedic literature."

The material ego is endowed predominantly with active power of three kinds: good, passionate and ignorant. It is from these three types of material ego that the mind, the senses of perception, the organs of action, and the gross elements evolve.",
        "purport": " In the beginning, from clear consciousness, or the pure state of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the first contamination sprang up. This is called false ego, or identification of the body as self. The living entity exists in the natural state of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but he has marginal independence, and this allows him to forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Originally, pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness exists, but because of misuse of marginal independence there is a chance of forgetting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is exhibited in actual life; there are many instances in which someone acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness suddenly changes. In the Upani\u1e63ads it is therefore stated that the path of spiritual realization is just like the sharp edge of a razor. The example is very appropriate. One shaves his cheeks with a sharp razor very nicely, but as soon as his attention is diverted from the activity, he immediately cuts his cheek because he mishandles the razor. Not only must one come to the stage of pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but one must also be very careful. Any inattentiveness or carelessness may cause falldown. This falldown is due to false ego. From the status of pure consciousness, the false ego is born because of misuse of independence. We cannot argue about why false ego arises from pure consciousness. Factually, there is always the chance that this will happen, and therefore one has to be very careful. False ego is the basic principle for all material activities, which are executed in the modes of material nature. As soon as one deviates from pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he increases his entanglement in material reaction. The entanglement of materialism is the material mind, and from this material mind, the senses and material organs become manifest."

Therefore the word sa\u1e41\u015baya is very important; in order to cultivate intelligence, one should be doubtful in the beginning. But doubting is not very favorable when information is received from the proper source. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that doubting the words of the authority is the cause of destruction. As described in the Pata\u00f1jali yoga system, pram\u0101\u1e47a-viparyaya-vikalpa-nidra-sm\u1e5btya\u1e25. By intelligence only one can understand things as they are. By intelligence only can one understand whether or not he is the body. The study to determine whether one\u2019s identity is spiritual or material begins in doubt. When one is able to analyze his actual position, the false identification with the body is detected. This is vipary\u0101sa. When false identification is detected, then real identification can be understood. Real understanding is described here as ni\u015bcaya\u1e25, or proved experimental knowledge. This experimental knowledge can be achieved when one has understood the false knowledge. By experimental or proved knowledge, one can understand that he is not the body but spirit soul. Sm\u1e5bti means \u201cmemory,\u201d and sv\u0101pa means \u201csleep.\u201d Sleep is also necessary to keep the intelligence in working order. If there is no sleep, the brain cannot work nicely. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is especially mentioned that persons who regulate eating, sleeping and other necessities of the body in the proper proportion become very successful in the yoga process. These are some of the aspects of the analytical study of intelligence as described in both the Pata\u00f1jali yoga system and the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy system of Kapiladeva in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

        "translation": "Egoism in the mode of passion produces two kinds of senses: the senses for acquiring knowledge and the senses of action. The senses of action depend on the vital energy, and the senses for acquiring knowledge depend on intelligence.",
        "purport": " It has been explained in the previous verses that mind is the product of ego in goodness and that the function of the mind is acceptance and rejection according to desire. But here intelligence is said to be the product of ego in passion. That is the distinction between mind and intelligence: mind is a product of egoism in goodness, and intelligence is a product of egoism in passion. The desire to accept something and reject something is a very important factor of the mind. Since mind is a product of the mode of goodness, if it is fixed upon the Lord of the mind, Aniruddha, then the mind can be changed to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is stated by Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura that we always have desires. Desire cannot be stopped. But if we transfer our desires to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that is the perfection of life. As soon as the desire is transferred to lording it over material nature, it becomes contaminated by matter. Desire has to be purified. In the beginning, this purification process has to be carried out by the order of the spiritual master, since the spiritual master knows how the disciple\u2019s desires can be transformed into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As far as intelligence is concerned, it is clearly stated here that it is a product of egoism in passion. By practice one comes to the point of the mode of goodness, and by surrendering or fixing the mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one becomes a very great personality, or mah\u0101tm\u0101. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly said, sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25: \u201cSuch a great soul is very rare.\u201d In this verse it is clear that both kinds of senses, the senses for acquiring knowledge and the senses for action, are products of egoism in the mode of passion. And because the sense organs for activity and for acquiring knowledge require energy, the vital energy, or life energy, is also produced by egoism in the mode of passion. We can therefore actually see that those who are very passionate can improve in material acquisition very quickly. It is recommended in the Vedic scriptures that if one wants to encourage a person in acquiring material possessions, one should also encourage him in sex life. We naturally find that those who are addicted to sex life are also materially advanced because sex life or passionate life is the impetus for the material advancement of civilization. For those who want to make spiritual advancement, there is almost no existence of the mode of passion. Only the mode of goodness is prominent. We find that those who engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are materially poor, but one who has eyes can see who is the greater. Although he appears to be materially poor, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not actually a poor man, but the person who has no taste for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and appears to be very happy with material possessions is actually poor. Persons infatuated by material consciousness are very intelligent in discovering things for material comforts, but they have no access to understanding the spirit soul and spiritual life. Therefore if anyone wants to advance in spiritual life, he has to come back to the platform of purified desire, the purified desire for devotional service. As stated in the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, engagement in the service of the Lord when the senses are purified in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is called pure devotion."

        "translation": "When egoism in ignorance is agitated by the sex energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the subtle element sound is manifested, and from sound come the ethereal sky and the sense of hearing.",
        "purport": " It appears from this verse that all the objects of our sense gratification are the products of egoism in ignorance. It is understood from this verse that by agitation of the element of egoism in ignorance, the first thing produced was sound, which is the subtle form of ether. It is stated also in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra that sound is the origin of all objects of material possession and that by sound one can also dissolve this material existence. An\u0101v\u1e5btti\u1e25 \u015babd\u0101t means \u201cliberation by sound.\u201d The entire material manifestation began from sound, and sound can also end material entanglement, if it has a particular potency. The particular sound capable of doing this is the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Our entanglement in material affairs has begun from material sound. Now we must purify that sound in spiritual understanding. There is sound in the spiritual world also. If we approach that sound, then our spiritual life begins, and the other requirements for spiritual advancement can be supplied. We have to understand very clearly that sound is the beginning of the creation of all material objects for our sense gratification. Similarly, if sound is purified, our spiritual necessities also are produced from sound. Here it is said that from sound the ether became manifested and that the air became manifested from ether. How the ethereal sky comes from sound, how the air comes from sky and how fire comes from air will be explained later on. Sound is the cause of the sky, and sky is the cause of \u015brotram, the ear. The ear is the first sense for receiving knowledge. One must give aural reception to any knowledge one wants to receive, either material or spiritual. Therefore \u015brotram is very important. The Vedic knowledge is called \u015bruti; knowledge has to be received by hearing. By hearing only can we have access to either material or spiritual enjoyment. In the material world, we manufacture many things for our material comfort simply by hearing. They are already there, but just by hearing, one can transform them. If we want to build a very high skyscraper, this does not mean that we have to create it. The materials for the skyscraper \u2014 wood, metal, earth, etc. \u2014 are already there, but we make our intimate relationship with those already created material elements by hearing how to utilize them. Modern economic advancement for creation is also a product of hearing, and similarly one can create a favorable field of spiritual activities by hearing from the right source. Arjuna was a gross materialist in the bodily conception of life and was suffering from the bodily concept very acutely. But simply by hearing, Arjuna became a spiritualized, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. Hearing is very important, and that hearing is produced from the sky. By hearing only can we make proper use of that which already exists. The principle of hearing to properly utilize preconceived materials is applicable to spiritual paraphernalia as well. We must hear from the proper spiritual source."

        "translation": "Persons who are learned and who have true knowledge define sound as that which conveys the idea of an object, indicates the presence of a speaker screened from our view and constitutes the subtle form of ether.",
        "purport": " It is very clear herein that as soon as we speak of hearing, there must be a speaker; without a speaker there is no question of hearing. Therefore the Vedic knowledge, which is known as \u015bruti, or that which is received by hearing, is also called apauru\u1e63a. Apauru\u1e63a means \u201cnot spoken by any person materially created.\u201d It is stated in the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, tene brahma h\u1e5bd\u0101. The sound of Brahman, or Veda, was first impregnated into the heart of Brahm\u0101, the original learned man (\u0101di-kavaye). How did he become learned? Whenever there is learning, there must be a speaker and the process of hearing. But Brahm\u0101 was the first created being. Who spoke to him? Since no one was there, who was the spiritual master to give knowledge? He was the only living creature; therefore the Vedic knowledge was imparted within his heart by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated within everyone as Param\u0101tm\u0101. Vedic knowledge is understood to be spoken by the Supreme Lord, and therefore it is free from the defects of material understanding. Material understanding is defective. If we hear something from a conditioned soul, it is full of defects. All material and mundane information is tainted by illusion, error, cheating and imperfection of the senses. Because Vedic knowledge was imparted by the Supreme Lord, who is transcendental to material creation, it is perfect. If we receive that Vedic knowledge from Brahm\u0101 in disciplic succession, then we receive perfect knowledge. Every word we hear has a meaning behind it. As soon as we hear the word \u201cwater,\u201d there is a substance \u2014 water \u2014 behind the word. Similarly, as soon as we hear the word \u201cGod,\u201d there is a meaning to it. If we receive that meaning and explanation of \u201cGod\u201d from God Himself, then it is perfect. But if we speculate about the meaning of \u201cGod,\u201d it is imperfect. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which is the science of God, is spoken by the Personality of Godhead Himself. This is perfect knowledge. Mental speculators or so-called philosophers who are researching what is actually God will never understand the nature of God. The science of God has to be understood in disciplic succession from Brahm\u0101, who was first instructed about knowledge of God by God Himself. We can understand the knowledge of God by hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from a person authorized in the disciplic succession. When we speak of seeing, there must be form. By our sense perception, the beginning experience is the sky. Sky is the beginning of form. And from the sky, other forms emanate. Therefore the objects of knowledge and sense perception begin from the sky."

Form rests in subtle existence in the sky, and internally it is perceived as the veins within the body and the circulation of the vital air. Externally there are invisible forms of sense objects. The production of the invisible sense objects is the external activity of the ethereal element, and the circulation of vital air and blood is its internal activity. That subtle forms exist in the ether has been proven by modern science by transmission of television, by which forms or photographs of one place are transmitted to another place by the action of the ethereal element. That is very nicely explained here. This verse is the potential basis of great scientific research work, for it explains how subtle forms are generated from the ethereal element, what their characteristics and actions are, and how the tangible elements, namely air, fire, water and earth, are manifested from the subtle form. Mental activities, or psychological actions of thinking, feeling and willing, are also activities on the platform of ethereal existence. The statement in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the mental situation at the time of death is the basis of the next birth is also corroborated in this verse. Mental existence transforms into tangible form as soon as there is an opportunity due to contamination or development of the gross elements from subtle form."

By manipulation of earth and its products, such as stone, wood and jewels, these forms of the Supreme Lord can be present before our eyes. When a form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is manifested by presentation of a statue made of earth, it is not imaginary. The earth gives shape to the Lord\u2019s forms as described in the scriptures. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 there is description of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lands, the variegatedness of the spiritual abode, and the forms of the Lord playing a flute with His spiritual body. All these forms are described in the scriptures, and when they are thus presented they become worshipable. They are not imaginary as the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy says. Sometimes the word bh\u0101vana is misinterpreted as \u201cimagination.\u201d But bh\u0101vana does not mean \u201cimagination\u201d; it means giving actual shape to the description of Vedic literature.

We can see this in our ordinary experience. Although we may have clay, water and fire, the elements take the shape of a brick only when we labor to combine them. Without the living energy, there is no possibility that matter can take shape. Similarly, this material world does not develop unless agitated by the Supreme Lord as the vir\u0101\u1e6d-puru\u1e63a.

Its layers of water, air, fire, sky, ego and mahat-tattva increase in thickness one after another. Each layer is ten times bigger than the previous one, and the final outside layer is covered by pradh\u0101na. Within this egg is the universal form of Lord Hari, of whose body the fourteen planetary systems are parts.",
        "purport": " This universe, or the universal sky which we can visualize with its innumerable planets, is shaped just like an egg. As an egg is covered by a shell, the universe is also covered by various layers. The first layer is water, the next is fire, then air, then sky, and the ultimate holding crust is pradh\u0101na. Within this egglike universe is the universal form of the Lord as the vir\u0101\u1e6d-puru\u1e63a. All the different planetary situations are parts of His body. This is already explained in the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Second Canto. The planetary systems are considered to form different bodily parts of that universal form of the Lord. Persons who cannot directly engage in the worship of the transcendental form of the Lord are advised to think of and worship this universal form. The lowest planetary system, P\u0101t\u0101la, is considered to be the sole of the Supreme Lord, and the earth is considered to be the belly of the Lord. Brahmaloka, or the highest planetary system, where Brahm\u0101 lives, is considered to be the head of the Lord. This vir\u0101\u1e6d-puru\u1e63a is considered an incarnation of the Lord. The original form of the Lord is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u0101di-puru\u1e63a. The vir\u0101\u1e6d-puru\u1e63a is also puru\u1e63a, but He is not \u0101di-puru\u1e63a. The \u0101di-puru\u1e63a is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25/ an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also accepted as the \u0101di-puru\u1e63a, the original. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cNo one is greater than Me.\u201d There are innumerable expansions of the Lord, and all of them are puru\u1e63as, or enjoyers, but neither the vir\u0101\u1e6d-puru\u1e63a nor the puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ras \u2014 K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2014 nor any of the many other expansions, is the original. In each universe there are Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the vir\u0101\u1e6d-puru\u1e63a and K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The active manifestation of the vir\u0101\u1e6d-puru\u1e63a is described here. Persons who are in the lower grade of understanding regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead may think of the universal form of the Lord, for that is advised in the Bh\u0101gavatam. The dimensions of the universe are estimated here. The outer covering is made of layers of water, air, fire, sky, ego and mahat-tattva, and each layer is ten times greater than the one previous. The space within the hollow of the universe cannot be measured by any human scientist or anyone else, and beyond the hollow there are seven coverings, each one ten times greater than the one preceding it. The layer of water is ten times greater than the diameter of the universe, and the layer of fire is ten times greater than that of water. Similarly, the layer of air is ten times greater than that of fire. These dimensions are all inconceivable to the tiny brain of a human being. It is also stated that this description is of only one egglike universe. There are innumerable universes besides this one, and some of them are many, many times greater. It is considered, in fact, that this universe is the smallest; therefore the predominating superintendent, or Brahm\u0101, has only four heads for management. In other universes, which are far greater than this one, Brahm\u0101 has more heads. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is stated that all these Brahm\u0101s were called one day by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on the inquiry of the small Brahm\u0101, who, after seeing all the larger Brahm\u0101s, was thunderstruck. That is the inconceivable potency of the Lord. No one can measure the length and breadth of God by speculation or by false identification with God. These attempts are symptoms of lunacy."

        "purport": " The moon appeared after the appearance of mind, and this indicates that the moon is the presiding deity of mind. Similarly, Lord Brahm\u0101, appearing after intelligence, is the presiding deity of intelligence, and Lord \u015aiva, who appears after false ego, is the presiding deity of false ego. In other words, it is indicated that the moon-god is in the mode of goodness, whereas Lord Brahm\u0101 is in the mode of passion and Lord \u015aiva is in the mode of ignorance. The appearance of consciousness after the appearance of false ego indicates that, from the beginning, material consciousness is under the mode of ignorance and that one therefore has to purify himself by purifying his consciousness. This purificatory process is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As soon as the consciousness is purified, the false ego disappears. Identification of the body with the self is called false identification, or false ego. Lord Caitanya confirms this in His \u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka. He states that the first result of chanting the mah\u0101-mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is that dirt is cleared from the consciousness, or the mirror of the mind, and then at once the blazing fire of material existence is over. The blazing fire of material existence is due to false ego, but as soon as the false ego is removed, one can understand his real identity. At that point he is actually liberated from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. As soon as one is freed from the clutches of false ego, his intelligence also becomes purified, and then his mind is always engaged upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared on the full-moon day as Gauracandra, or the spotless transcendental moon. The material moon has spots on it, but on the transcendental moon, Gauracandra, there are no spots. In order to fix the purified mind in the service of the Supreme Lord, one has to worship the spotless moon, Gauracandra. Those who are materially passionate or those who want to exhibit their intelligence for material advancement in life are generally worshipers of Lord Brahm\u0101, and persons who are in the gross ignorance of identifying with the body worship Lord \u015aiva. Materialists like Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and R\u0101va\u1e47a are worshipers of Lord Brahm\u0101 or Lord \u015aiva, but Prahl\u0101da and other devotees in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness worship the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead."

        "translation": "Therefore, through devotion, detachment and advancement in spiritual knowledge acquired through concentrated devotional service, one should contemplate that Supersoul as present in this very body although simultaneously apart from it.",
        "purport": " One can realize the Supersoul within oneself. He is within one\u2019s body but apart from the body, or transcendental to the body. Although sitting in the same body as the individual soul, the Supersoul has no affection for the body, whereas the individual soul does. Therefore one has to detach himself from this material body, by discharging devotional service. It is clearly mentioned here (bhakty\u0101) that one has to execute devotional service to the Supreme. As it is stated in the First Canto, Second Chapter, of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.7), v\u0101sudeve bhagavati bhakti-yoga\u1e25 prayojita\u1e25. When V\u0101sudeva, the all-pervading Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is served in completely pure devotion, detachment from the material world immediately begins. The purpose of S\u0101\u1e45khya is to detach oneself from material contamination. This can be achieved simply by devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one is detached from the attraction of material prosperity, one can actually concentrate his mind upon the Supersoul. As long as the mind is distracted towards the material, there is no possibility of concentrating one\u2019s mind and intelligence upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His partial representation, Supersoul. In other words, one cannot concentrate one\u2019s mind and energy upon the Supreme unless one is detached from the material world. Following detachment from the material world, one can actually attain transcendental knowledge of the Absolute Truth. As long as one is entangled in sense enjoyment, or material enjoyment, it is not possible to understand the Absolute Truth. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54). One who is freed from material contamination is joyful and can enter into devotional service, and by devotional service he can be liberated. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, First Canto, it is stated that one becomes joyful by discharging devotional service. In that joyful attitude, one can understand the science of God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; otherwise it is not possible. The analytical study of the elements of material nature and the concentration of the mind upon the Supersoul are the sum and substance of the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophical system. The perfection of this s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga culminates in devotional service unto the Absolute Truth."
