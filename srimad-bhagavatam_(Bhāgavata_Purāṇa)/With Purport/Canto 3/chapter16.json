        "purport": " To commit an offense at the feet of a devotee of the Lord is a great wrong. Even when a living entity is promoted to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, there is still the chance that he may commit offenses, but the difference is that when one is in a Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet, even if by chance one commits an offense, he is protected by the Lord. This is the remarkable fact in the dealings of the Lord and the servitor, as seen in the present incident concerning Jaya and Vijaya. The word atikramam used herein indicates that in offending a devotee one neglects the Supreme Lord Himself. By mistake the doormen held the sages from entering Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, but because they were engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, their annihilation was not expected by advanced devotees. The Lord\u2019s presence on the spot was very pleasing to the hearts of the devotees. The Lord understood that the trouble was due to His lotus feet not being seen by the sages, and therefore He wanted to please them by personally going there. The Lord is so merciful that even if there is some impediment for the devotee, He Himself manages matters in such a way that the devotee is not bereft of having audience at His lotus feet. There is a very good example in the life of Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura. When Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was residing at Jagann\u0101tha pur\u012b, Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, who happened to be Muhammadan by birth, was with Him. In Hindu temples, especially in those days, no one but a Hindu was allowed to enter. Although Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura was the greatest of all Hindus in his behavior, he considered himself a Muhammadan and did not enter the temple. Lord Caitanya could understand his humility, and since he did not go to see the temple, Lord Caitanya Himself, who is nondifferent from Jagann\u0101tha, used to come and sit with Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura daily. Here in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam we also find this same behavior of the Lord. His devotees were prevented from seeing His lotus feet, but the Lord Himself came to see them on the same lotus feet for which they aspired. It is also significant that He was accompanied by the goddess of fortune. The goddess of fortune is not to be seen by ordinary persons, but the Lord was so kind that although the devotees did not aspire for such an honor, He appeared before them with the goddess of fortune."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is also the worshipable Deity of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. In the Vedic literature, in the \u1e5bg-mantra hymns of the \u1e5ag Veda, it is stated that those who are actually br\u0101hma\u1e47as always look to the lotus feet of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u: o\u1e41 tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 pada\u1e41 sad\u0101 pa\u015byanti s\u016braya\u1e25. Those who are qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as worship only the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which means K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, R\u0101ma and all Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions. A so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47a who is born in the family of br\u0101hma\u1e47as but performs activities aimed against the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas cannot be accepted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, because br\u0101hma\u1e47a means Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava means br\u0101hma\u1e47a. One who has become a devotee of the Lord is also a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The formula is brahma j\u0101n\u0101t\u012bti br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u1e25. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is one who has understood Brahman, and a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is one who has understood the Personality of Godhead. Brahman realization is the beginning of realization of the Personality of Godhead. One who understands the Personality of Godhead also knows the impersonal feature of the Supreme, which is Brahman. Therefore one who becomes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is already a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. It should be noted that the glories of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a described in this chapter by the Lord Himself refer to His devotee-br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. It should never be misunderstood that the so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47as who are born in br\u0101hma\u1e47a families but have no brahminical qualifications are referred to in this connection."

        "translation": "Anyone in the entire world, even down to the ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la, who lives by cooking and eating the flesh of the dog, is immediately purified if he takes bath in hearing through the ear the glorification of My name, fame, etc. Now you have realized Me without doubt; therefore I will not hesitate to lop off My own arm if its conduct is found hostile to you.",
        "purport": " Real purification can take place in human society if its members take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is clearly stated in all Vedic literature. Anyone who takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in all sincerity, even if he is not very advanced in good behavior, is purified. A devotee can be recruited from any section of human society, although it is not expected that everyone in all segments of society is well-behaved. As stated in this verse and in many places in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, even if one is not born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family, or even if he is born in a family of ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las, if he simply takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness he is immediately purified. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Ninth Chapter, verses 30-32, it is clearly stated that even though a man is not well-behaved, if he simply takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness he is understood to be a saintly person. As long as a person is in this material world he has two different relationships in his dealings with others \u2014 one relationship pertains to the body, and the other pertains to the spirit. As far as bodily affairs or social activities are concerned, although a person is purified on the spiritual platform, it is sometimes seen that he acts in terms of his bodily relationships. If a devotee born in the family of a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la (the lowest caste) is sometimes found engaged in his habitual activities, he is not to be considered a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la. In other words, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should not be evaluated in terms of his body. The \u015b\u0101stra states that no one should think the Deity in the temple to be made of wood or stone, and no one should think that a person coming from a lower-caste family who has taken to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is still of the same low caste. These attitudes are forbidden because anyone who takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is understood to be fully purified. He is at least engaged in the process of purification, and if he sticks to the principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness he will very soon be fully purified. The conclusion is that if one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with all seriousness, he is to be understood as already purified, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ready to give him protection by all means. The Lord assures herein that He is ready to give protection to His devotee even if there is need to cut off part of His own body."

As the devotee thinks that it is due to being a devotee of the Lord that he is elevated in all good qualities, so the Lord also thinks that it is because of His devotion to the servitor that all His transcendental glories have increased. In other words, as the devotee is always anxious to render service to the Lord, so the Lord is ever anxious to render service to the devotee. The Lord admits herein that although He certainly has the quality that anyone who receives a slight particle of the dust of His lotus feet becomes at once a great personality, this greatness is due to His affection for His devotee. It is because of this affection that the goddess of fortune does not leave Him and that not only one but many thousands of goddesses of fortune engage in His service. In the material world, simply to get a little favor from the goddess of fortune, people observe many rigid regulations of austerity and penance. The Lord cannot tolerate any inconvenience on the part of the devotee. He is therefore famous as bhakta-vatsala."

        "purport": " The devotee of the Lord, or the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, does not take anything without offering it to the Lord. Since a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava dedicates all the results of his activities to the Lord, he does not taste anything eatable which is not first offered to Him. The Lord also relishes giving to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u2019s mouth all eatables offered to Him. It is clear from this verse that the Lord eats through the sacrificial fire and the br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s mouth. So many articles \u2014 grains, ghee, etc. \u2014 are offered in sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord. The Lord accepts sacrificial offerings from the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and devotees, and elsewhere it is stated that whatever is given for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas to eat is also accepted by the Lord. But here it is said that He accepts offerings to the mouths of br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas with even greater relish. The best example of this is found in the life of Advaita Prabhu in his dealings with Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura. Even though Harid\u0101sa was born of a Muhammadan family, Advaita Prabhu offered him the first dish of pras\u0101da after the performance of a sacred fire ceremony. Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura informed him that he was born of a Muhammadan family and asked why Advaita Prabhu was offering the first dish to a Muhammadan instead of an elevated br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Out of his humbleness, Harid\u0101sa condemned himself a Muhammadan, but Advaita Prabhu, being an experienced devotee, accepted him as a real br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Advaita Prabhu asserted that by offering the first dish to Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, he was getting the result of feeding one hundred thousand br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The conclusion is that if one can feed a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, it is better than performing hundreds of thousands of sacrifices. In this age, therefore, it is recommended that harer n\u0101ma \u2014 chanting the holy name of God \u2014 and pleasing the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava are the only means to elevate oneself to spiritual life."

The Lord\u2019s supremacy is equal in both the spiritual and material worlds, but the spiritual world is called the kingdom of God, and the material world is called the kingdom of m\u0101y\u0101. M\u0101y\u0101 refers to that which is not actually fact. The opulence of the material world is a reflection. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that this material world is just like a tree whose roots are up and branches down. This means that the material world is the shadow of the spiritual world. Real opulence is in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world the predominating Deity is the Lord Himself, whereas in the material world there are many lords. That is the difference between the internal and external energies. The Lord says that although He is the predominating factor of the internal energy and although the material world is sanctified just by the water that has washed His feet, He has the greatest respect for the br\u0101hma\u1e47a and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. When the Lord Himself offers so much respect to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, how can one deny such respect to such personalities?"

        "purport": " The defenseless creatures, according to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, are the cows, br\u0101hma\u1e47as, women, children and old men. Of these five, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and cows are especially mentioned in this verse because the Lord is always anxious about the benefit of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the cows and is prayed to in this way. Therefore the Lord especially instructs that no one should be envious of these five, especially the cows and br\u0101hma\u1e47as. In some of the Bh\u0101gavatam readings, the word duhit\u1e5d\u1e25 is used instead of duhat\u012b\u1e25. But in either case, the meaning is the same. Duhat\u012b\u1e25 means \u201ccow,\u201d and duhit\u1e5d\u1e25 can also be used to mean \u201ccow\u201d because the cow is supposed to be the daughter of the sun-god. Just as children are taken care of by the parents, women as a class should be taken care of by the father, husband or grown-up son. Those who are helpless must be taken care of by their respective guardians; otherwise the guardians will be subjected to the punishment of Yamar\u0101ja, who is appointed by the Lord to supervise the activities of sinful living creatures. The assistants, or messengers, of Yamar\u0101ja are likened here to vultures, and those who do not execute their respective duties in protecting their wards are compared to serpents. Vultures deal very seriously with serpents, and similarly the messengers will deal very seriously with neglectful guardians."

        "purport": " It has been observed in many instances in the Vedic scriptures that when the br\u0101hma\u1e47as or Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas curse someone in an angry mood, the person who is cursed does not take it upon himself to treat the br\u0101hma\u1e47as or Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas in the same way. There are many examples of this. For instance, the sons of Kuvera, when cursed by the great sage N\u0101rada, did not seek revenge in the same harsh way, but submitted. Here also, when Jaya and Vijaya were cursed by the four Kum\u0101ras, they did not become harsh towards them; rather, they submitted. That should be the way of treating br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. One may sometimes be faced with a grievous situation created by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, but instead of meeting him with a similar mood, one should try to pacify him with a smiling face and mild treatment. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas should be accepted as earthly representatives of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Nowadays some foolish persons have manufactured the term daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, indicating that the poor man should be accepted as the representative of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. But in Vedic literature we do not find that poor men should be treated as representatives of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Of course, \u201cthose who are unprotected\u201d are mentioned here, but the definition of this phrase is clear from the \u015b\u0101stras. The poor man should not be unprotected, but the br\u0101hma\u1e47a should especially be treated as the representative of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and should be worshiped like Him. It is specifically said that to pacify the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, one\u2019s face should be lotuslike. A lotuslike face is exhibited when one is adorned with love and affection. In this respect, the example of the father\u2019s being angry at the son and the son\u2019s trying to pacify the father with smiling and sweet words is very appropriate."

        "purport": " The statement in this verse dharmasya paramo guhya\u1e25 refers to the most confidential part of all religious principles. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The conclusion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His advice to Arjuna is: \u201cGive up all other religious engagement and just surrender unto Me.\u201d This is the most confidential knowledge in executing religious principles. In the Bh\u0101gavatam also it is stated that if one does not become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious after very rigidly executing one\u2019s specified religious duties, all his labor in following so-called religious principles is simply a waste of time. Here also the sages confirm the statement that the Supreme Lord, not the demigods, is the ultimate goal of all religious principles. There are many foolish propagandists who say that worship of the demigods is also a way to reach the supreme goal, but in the authorized statements of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this is not accepted. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 says that one who worships a particular demigod can reach the demigod\u2019s planet, but one who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead can enter into Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Some propagandists say that regardless of what one does he will ultimately reach the supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, but this is not valid. The Lord is eternal, the Lord\u2019s servitor is eternal, and the Lord\u2019s abode is also eternal. They are all described here as san\u0101tana, or eternal. The result of devotional service, therefore, is not temporary, as is the achievement of heavenly planets by worshiping the demigods. The sages wanted to stress that although the Lord, out of His causeless mercy, says that He worships the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, actually the Lord is worshipable not only by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas but also by the demigods."

        "purport": " Unless one is favored by the Supreme Lord, one cannot cross over the ocean of the nescience of repeated birth and death. Here it is stated that yog\u012bs or mystics cross beyond nescience by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many kinds of mystics, such as the karma-yog\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b, dhy\u0101na-yog\u012b and bhakti-yog\u012b. The karm\u012bs particularly search after the favor of the demigods, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs want to become one with the Supreme Absolute Truth, and the yog\u012bs are satisfied simply by partial vision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and ultimately by oneness with Him. But the bhaktas, the devotees, want to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead eternally and serve Him. It has already been admitted that the Lord is eternal, and those who want the favor of the Supreme Lord perpetually are also eternal. Therefore yog\u012bs here means devotees. By the mercy of the Lord, devotees can easily pass beyond the nescience of birth and death and attain the eternal abode of the Lord. The Lord is therefore not in need of another\u2019s favor because no one is equal to or greater than Him. Actually, everyone needs the favor of the Lord for successful understanding of his human mission."

The Lord has six opulences \u2014 unlimited wealth, unlimited fame, unlimited strength, unlimited beauty, unlimited knowledge and unlimited renunciation. All the demigods and other living entities worship Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the goddess of fortune, just to get her favor, yet the Lord is never attached to her because He can create an unlimited number of such goddesses for His transcendental service. The goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, is sometimes envious of the tulas\u012b leaves which are placed at the lotus feet of the Lord, for they remain fixed there and do not move, whereas Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b, although stationed by the chest of the Lord, sometimes has to please other devotees who pray for her favor. Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b sometimes has to go to satisfy her numerous devotees, but tulas\u012b leaves never forsake their position, and the Lord therefore appreciates the service of the tulas\u012b more than the service of Lak\u1e63m\u012b. So when the Lord says that it is due to the causeless mercy of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as that Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b does not leave Him, we can understand that Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b is attracted by the opulence of the Lord, not by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 benedictions upon Him. The Lord is not dependent on anyone\u2019s mercy for His opulence; He is always self-sufficient. The Lord\u2019s statement that His opulence is due to the benediction of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas is only to teach others that they should offer respect to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, the devotees of the Lord."

Therefore You manifest Yourself in three millenniums, and thus You protect this universe, which consists of animate and inanimate beings. By Your grace, which is of pure goodness and is the bestower of all blessings, kindly drive away the elements of rajas and tamas for the sake of the demigods and twice-born.",
        "purport": " The Lord is addressed in this verse as tri-yuga, or one who appears in three millenniums, namely the Satya, Dv\u0101para and Tret\u0101 yugas. He is not mentioned as appearing in the fourth millennium, or Kali-yuga. It is described in Vedic literature that in Kali-yuga He comes as channa-avat\u0101ra, or an incarnation, but He does not appear as a manifest incarnation. In the other yugas, however, the Lord is a manifest incarnation, and therefore he is addressed as tri-yuga, or the Lord who appears in three yugas. \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b describes tri-yuga as follows: yuga means \u201ccouple,\u201d and tri means \u201cthree.\u201d The Lord is manifested as three couples by His six opulences, or three couples of opulences. In that way He can be addressed as tri-yuga. The Lord is the personality of religious principles. In three millenniums religious principles are protected by three kinds of spiritual culture, namely austerity, cleanliness and mercy. The Lord is called tri-yuga in that way also. In the Age of Kali these three requisites to spiritual culture are almost absent, but the Lord is so kind that in spite of Kali-yuga\u2019s being devoid of these three spiritual qualities, He comes and protects the people of this age in His covered incarnation as Lord Caitanya. Lord Caitanya is called \u201ccovered\u201d because although He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, He presents Himself as a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not directly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotees pray to Lord Caitanya, therefore, to eliminate their stock of passion and ignorance, the most conspicuous assets of this yuga. In the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement one cleanses himself of the modes of passion and ignorance by chanting the holy name of the Lord \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 as introduced by Lord Caitanya. The four Kum\u0101ras were cognizant of their situation in the modes of passion and ignorance because, although in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, they wanted to curse devotees of the Lord. Since they were conscious of their own weakness, they prayed to the Lord to remove their still-existing passion and ignorance. The three transcendental qualifications \u2014 cleanliness, austerity and mercy \u2014 are the qualifications of the twice-born and the demigods. Those who are not situated in the quality of goodness cannot accept these three principles of spiritual culture. For the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, therefore, there are three sinful activities which are prohibited: illicit sex, intoxication, and eating anything other than pras\u0101da, food offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These three prohibitions are based on the principles of austerity, cleanliness and mercy. Devotees are merciful because they spare the poor animals, and they are clean because they are free of contamination from unwanted foodstuff and unwanted habits. Austerity is represented by restricted sex life. These principles, indicated by the prayers of the four Kum\u0101ras, should be followed by the devotees who are engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "translation": "O Lord, You are the protector of the highest of the twice-born. If You do not protect them by offering worship and mild words, then certainly the auspicious path of worship will be rejected by people in general, who act on the strength and authority of Your Lordship.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated by the Lord Himself that the acts and character of great authorities are followed by people in general. Leaders of ideal character are therefore needed in society. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared in this material world just to show the example of perfect authority, and people have to follow His path. The Vedic injunction is that one cannot understand the Absolute Truth simply by mental speculation or logical argument. One has to follow the authorities. Mah\u0101jano yena gata\u1e25 sa panth\u0101\u1e25. Great authorities should be followed; otherwise, if we simply depend on the scriptures, we are sometimes misled by rascals, or else we cannot understand or follow the different spiritual injunctions. The best path is to follow the authorities. The four br\u0101hma\u1e47a sages stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is naturally the protector of the cows and br\u0101hma\u1e47as: go-br\u0101hma\u1e47a-hit\u0101ya ca. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was on this planet, He set a practical example. He was a cowherd boy, and He was very respectful to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and devotees. It is also affirmed herein that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the best of the twice-born. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas are all twice-born, but the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the best. When there is a fight between two persons, each of them protects the upper part of his body \u2014 the head, the arms and the belly. Similarly, for the actual advancement of human civilization, the best part of the social body, namely the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas (the intelligent class of men, the military class and the mercantile men) should be given special protection. Protection of the laborers should not be neglected, but special protection should be given to the upper orders. Of all classes of men, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas should be given special protection. They should be worshiped. When their protection is performed, it is just like worshiping God. That is not exactly protection; it is a duty. One should worship the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas by offering them all kinds of endowments and sweet words, and if one has no means to offer anything, he must at least use sweet words to pacify them. The Lord personally exhibited this behavior towards the Kum\u0101ras. If this system is not introduced by the leaders, then human civilization will be lost. When there is no protection and special treatment for persons who are devotees of the Lord, who are highly intelligent in spiritual life, then the whole society is lost. The word na\u1e45k\u1e63yati indicates that such a civilization becomes spoiled and is annihilated. The kind of civilization recommended is called deva-patha, which means the \u201croyal road of the demigods.\u201d Demigods are supposed to be fully fixed in devotional service, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; that is the auspicious path that should be protected. If the authorities or the leaders of society do not give special respect to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and do not offer them not only sweet words but all facilities, then the path of progress will be lost to human civilization. The Lord personally wanted to teach this, and therefore He offered so much praise to the Kum\u0101ras."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was never reduced in His position by becoming a cowherd boy or by offering respect to Sud\u0101m\u0101 Br\u0101hma\u1e47a or His other devotees like Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Vasudeva, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas\u2019 mother, Kunt\u012b. Everyone knew that He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, yet His behavior was exemplary. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha; His form is completely spiritual, full of bliss and knowledge, and it is eternal. Because the living entities are His parts and parcels, originally they also belong to the same quality of eternal form as the Lord, but when they come in contact with m\u0101y\u0101, the material potency, due to their forgetfulness their existential constitution is covered. We should try to understand the appearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this spirit, as the Kum\u0101ras pray to Him. He is eternally a cowherd boy at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, He is eternally the leader of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and He is eternally the opulent prince of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 and the lover of the damsels of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. All His appearances are meaningful because they show His real characteristics to the conditioned souls, who have forgotten their relationship with the Supreme Lord. He does everything for their benefit. The force exhibited in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra by the desire of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and through the agency of Arjuna was also necessary because when people become too irreligious, force is required. Nonviolence in this respect is rascaldom."

But they will be firmly united with Me in thought through mental concentration intensified by anger, and they will return to My presence shortly.",
        "purport": " The Lord stated that the punishment inflicted by the sages upon the doorkeepers Jaya and Vijaya was conceived by the Lord Himself. Without the Lord\u2019s sanction, nothing can happen. It is to be understood that there was a plan in the cursing of the Lord\u2019s devotees in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, and His plan is explained by many stalwart authorities. The Lord sometimes desires to fight. The fighting spirit also exists in the Supreme Lord; otherwise how could fighting be manifested at all? Because the Lord is the source of everything, anger and fighting are also inherent in His personality. When He desires to fight with someone, He has to find an enemy, but in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world there is no enemy because everyone is engaged fully in His service. Therefore He sometimes comes to the material world as an incarnation in order to manifest His fighting spirit. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.8) also it is said that the Lord appears just to give protection to the devotees and to annihilate the nondevotees. The nondevotees are found in the material world, not in the spiritual world; therefore, when the Lord wants to fight, He has to come to this world. But who will fight with the Supreme Lord? No one is able to fight with Him! Therefore, because the Lord\u2019s pastimes in the material world are always performed with His associates, not with others, He has to find some devotee who will play the part of an enemy. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says to Arjuna, \u201cMy dear Arjuna, both you and I have appeared many, many times in this material world, but you have forgotten, whereas I remember.\u201d Thus Jaya and Vijaya were selected by the Lord to fight with Him in the material world, and that was the reason the sages came to see Him and accidentally the doorkeepers were cursed. It was the Lord\u2019s desire to send them to the material world, not perpetually, but for some time. Therefore, just as on a theatrical stage someone takes the part of enemy to the proprietor of the stage, although the play is for a short time and there is no permanent enmity between the servant and the proprietor, so the sura-janas (devotees) were cursed by the sages to go to the asura-janas, or atheistic families. That a devotee should come into an atheistic family is surprising, but it is simply a show. After finishing their mock fighting, both the devotee and the Lord are again associated in the spiritual planets. That is very explicitly explained here. The conclusion is that no one falls from the spiritual world, or Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet, for it is the eternal abode. But sometimes, as the Lord desires, devotees come into this material world as preachers or as atheists. In each case we must understand that there is a plan of the Lord. Lord Buddha, for example, was an incarnation, yet he preached atheism: \u201cThere is no God.\u201d But actually there was a plan behind this, as explained in the Bh\u0101gavatam."

        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead advised the two doorkeepers, Jaya and Vijaya, that by dint of bhakti-yoga in anger they would be delivered from the curses of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. \u015ar\u012bla Madhva Muni remarks in this connection that by practicing bhakti-yoga one can become free from all sinful reactions. Even a brahma-\u015b\u0101pa, or curse by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, which cannot be overcome by any other means, can be overcome by bhakti-yoga. One can practice bhakti-yoga in many rasas. There are twelve rasas, five primary and seven secondary. The five primary rasas constitute direct bhakti-yoga, but although the seven secondary rasas are indirect, they are also counted within bhakti-yoga if they are used in the service of the Lord. In other words, bhakti-yoga is all-inclusive. If one somehow or other becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes engaged in bhakti-yoga, as described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.29.15): k\u0101ma\u1e41 krodha\u1e41 bhayam. The gop\u012bs were attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by bhakti-yoga in a relationship of lusty desire (k\u0101ma). Similarly, Ka\u1e41sa was attached to bhakti-yoga by dint of fear of his death. Thus bhakti-yoga is so powerful that even becoming an enemy of the Lord and always thinking of Him can deliver one very quickly. It is said, vi\u1e63\u1e47u-bhakta\u1e25 sm\u1e5bto daiva \u0101suras tad-vipanyaya\u1e25: \u201cDevotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are called demigods, whereas nondevotees are called asuras.\u201d But bhakti-yoga is so powerful that both demigods and asuras can derive its benefits if they always think of the Personality of Godhead. The basic principle of bhakti-yoga is to think of the Supreme Lord always. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.65), man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakta\u1e25: \u201cAlways think of Me.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter which way one thinks; the very thought of the Personality of Godhead is the basic principle of bhakti-yoga. In the material planets there are different grades of sinful activities, of which disrespecting a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is the most sinful. Here it is clearly stated that one can overcome even that grave sin simply by thinking of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, not even favorably but in anger. Thus even if those who are not devotees always think of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, they become free from all sinful activities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the highest form of thought. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is thought of in this age by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. From the statements of the Bh\u0101gavatam it appears that if one thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even as an enemy, that particular qualification \u2014 thinking of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 cleanses one of all sins."

In other words, the sages were not actually within Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, but were at the gate. It could be asked, \u201cHow could they return to the material world if they entered Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka?\u201d But factually they did not enter, and therefore they returned. There are many similar incidents where great yog\u012bs and br\u0101hma\u1e47as, by dint of their yoga practice, have gone from this material world to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka \u2014 but they were not meant to stay there. They came back. It is also confirmed here that the Lord was surrounded by many Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha airplanes. Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka is described here as having splendid opulence, far surpassing the splendor of this material world. All other living creatures, including the demigods, are born of Brahm\u0101, and Brahm\u0101 is born of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, in the Tenth Chapter, aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25: Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the origin of all manifestations in the material world. Those who know that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the origin of everything, who are conversant with the process of creation, and who understand that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the most worshipable object of all living entities, engage themselves in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u worship as Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. The Vedic hymns also confirm this: o\u1e41 tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 padam. The goal of life is to understand Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Bh\u0101gavatam also confirms this elsewhere. Foolish people, not knowing that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the supreme worshipable object, create so many worshipable objects in this material world, and therefore they fall down."

The living entity takes shelter within the semen of a father, which is injected within the womb of a mother, and with the help of the mother\u2019s emulsified ovum the living entity grows a particular type of a body. In this connection it is to be remembered that the mind of Ka\u015byapa Muni was not in order when he conceived the two sons, Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. Therefore the semen he discharged was simultaneously extremely powerful and mixed with the quality of anger. It is to be concluded that while conceiving a child one\u2019s mind must be very sober and devotional. For this purpose the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra is recommended in the Vedic scriptures. If the mind of the father is not sober, the semen discharged will not be very good. Thus the living entity, wrapped in the matter produced from the father and mother, will be demoniac like Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. The conditions of conception are to be carefully studied. This is a very great science."

They came within the material world by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He alone could counteract such disturbances. In other words, although Jaya and Vijaya assumed the bodies of asuras, they remained more powerful than anyone, thus proving that the Supreme Personality of Godhead desired to fight because the fighting spirit is also within Him. He is the original in everything, but when He desires to fight He must fight with a devotee. Therefore by His desire only were Jaya and Vijaya cursed by the Kum\u0101ras. The Lord ordered the gatekeepers to go down to the material world to become His enemies so that He could fight with them and His fighting desires would be satisfied by the service of His personal devotees. Brahm\u0101 showed the demigods that the situation created by the darkness, for which they were disturbed, was the desire of the Supreme Lord. He wanted to show that even though these two attendants were coming in the forms of demons, they were very powerful, greater than the demigods, who could not control them. No one can surpass the acts of the Supreme Lord. The demigods were also advised not to try to counteract this incident, because it was ordered by the Lord.

        "purport": " When something is arranged by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not be disturbed by it, even if it appears to be a reverse according to one\u2019s calculations. For example, sometimes we see that a powerful preacher is killed, or sometimes he is put into difficulty, just as Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura was. He was a great devotee who came into this material world to execute the will of the Lord by preaching the Lord\u2019s glories. But Harid\u0101sa was punished at the hands of the Kazi by being beaten in twenty-two marketplaces. Similarly, Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, and Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was put through so many tribulations. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were direct friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, lost their kingdom, their wife was insulted, and they had to undergo many severe tribulations. Seeing all these reverses affect devotees, one should not be disturbed; one should simply understand that in these matters there must be some plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Bh\u0101gavatam\u2019s conclusion is that a devotee is never disturbed by such reverses. He accepts even reverse conditions as the grace of the Lord. One who continues to serve the Lord even in reverse conditions is assured that he will go back to Godhead, back to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Lord Brahm\u0101 assured the demigods that there was no use in talking about how the disturbing situation of darkness was taking place, since the actual fact was that it was ordered by the Supreme Lord. Brahm\u0101 knew this because he was a great devotee; it was possible for him to understand the plan of the Lord."
