        "translation": "Lord Brahm\u0101 said: O my Lord, today, after many, many years of penance, I have come to know about You. Oh, how unfortunate the embodied living entities are that they are unable to know Your personality! My Lord, You are the only knowable object because there is nothing supreme beyond You. If there is anything supposedly superior to You, it is not the Absolute. You exist as the Supreme by exhibiting the creative energy of matter.",
        "purport": " The highest peak of the ignorance of the living entities who are conditioned by material bodies is that they are unaware of the supreme cause of the cosmic manifestation. Different people have different theories regarding the supreme cause, but none of them are genuine. The only supreme cause is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and the intervening impediment is the illusory energy of the Lord. The Lord has employed His wonderful material energy in manifesting many, many wonderful distractions in the material world, and the conditioned souls, illusioned by the same energy, are thus unable to know the supreme cause. The most stalwart scientists and philosophers, therefore, cannot be accepted as wonderful. They only appear wonderful because they are instruments in the hands of the illusory energy of the Lord. Under illusion, the general mass of people deny the existence of the Supreme Lord and accept the foolish products of illusory energy as supreme. One can know the supreme cause, the Personality of Godhead, by the causeless mercy of the Lord, which is bestowed upon the Lord\u2019s pure devotees like Brahm\u0101 and those in his disciplic succession. By acts of penance only was Lord Brahm\u0101 able to see the Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and by realization only could he understand the Lord as He is. Brahm\u0101 was extremely satisfied upon observing the magnificent beauty and opulence of the Lord, and he admitted that nothing can be comparable to Him. Only by penance can one appreciate the beauty and opulence of the Lord, and when one is acquainted with that beauty and opulence, he is no longer attracted by any other. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.59): para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate. Foolish human beings who do not endeavor to investigate the supreme beauty and opulence of the Lord are here condemned by Brahm\u0101. It is imperative that every human being try for such knowledge, and if anyone does not do so, his life is spoiled. Anything that is beautiful and opulent in the material sense is enjoyed by those living entities who are like crows. Crows always engage in picking at rejected garbage, whereas the white ducks do not mix with the crows. Rather, they take pleasure in transparent lakes with lotus flowers, surrounded by beautiful orchards. Both crows and ducks are undoubtedly birds by birth, but they are not of the same feather."

From the K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, many Vi\u1e63\u1e47u incarnations expand at different ages in the duration of the cosmic manifestation.

The incarnations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who appear at different ages and times, are never to be compared to the conditioned souls.

Anyone who compares them is called a p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b, or infidel. Tamasa\u1e25, mentioned herein, is the material nature, and the spiritual nature has a completely separate existence from tama\u1e25. Therefore, spiritual nature is called avabodha-rasa, or avarodha-rasa. Avarodha means \u201cthat which completely nullifies.\u201d In the Transcendence there is no chance of material contact by any means. Brahm\u0101 is the first living being, and therefore he mentions his birth from the lotus flower generated from the abdomen of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u."

Lord Brahm\u0101 became aware that the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has many, many eternal, blissful forms of knowledge. He has described such expansions of the Supreme Lord, Govinda, in his Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.33), as follows: \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is nondual and infallible. He is the original cause of all causes, even though He expands in many, many forms. Although He is the oldest personality, He is ever youthful, unaffected by old age. The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be known by the academic wisdom of the Vedas; one has to approach the devotee of the Lord to understand Him.\u201d The only way to understand the Lord as He is, is by devotional service to the Lord, or by approaching the devotee of the Lord who always has the Lord in his heart. By devotional perfection one can understand that the impersonal brahmajyoti is only a partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that the three puru\u1e63a expansions in the material creation are His plenary portions. In the spiritual sky of the brahmajyoti there is no change of various kalpas or millenniums, and there are no creative activities in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha worlds. The influence of time is conspicuous by its absence. The rays of the transcendental body of the Lord, the unlimited brahmajyoti, are undeterred by the influence of material energy. In the material world also, the initial creator is the Lord Himself. He brings about the creation of Brahm\u0101, who becomes the subsequent creator, empowered by the Lord."

The personal form of the Lord is also worshiped in meditation as Supersoul, Param\u0101tm\u0101, but the impersonal brahmajyoti is not worshiped. Persons who are addicted to the impersonal feature of the Lord, whether in meditation or otherwise, are all pilgrims to hell because, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (12.5), impersonalists simply waste their time in mundane mental speculation because they are addicted more to false arguments than to reality. Therefore, the association of the impersonalists is condemned herewith by Brahm\u0101. All the plenary expansions of the Personality of Godhead are equally potent, as confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.46): The Lord expands Himself as the flames of a fire expand one after another. Although the original flame, or \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is accepted as Govinda, the Supreme Person, all other expansions, such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha and Var\u0101ha, are as potent as the original Lord. All such expanded forms are transcendental. In the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is made clear that the Supreme Truth is eternally uncontaminated by material touch. There is no jugglery of words and activities in the transcendental kingdom of the Lord. All the Lord\u2019s forms are transcendental, and such manifestations are ever identical. The particular form of the Lord exhibited to a devotee is not mundane, even though the devotee may retain material desire, nor is it manifest under the influence of material energy, as is foolishly considered by the impersonalists. Impersonalists who consider the transcendental forms of the Lord to be products of the material world are surely destined for hell."

The word tu specifically establishes this fact. The Lord also does not wish to be separated from the lotus hearts of those pure devotees. That is the transcendental relationship between the pure devotees and the Personality of Godhead. Because the Lord does not wish to separate Himself from the hearts of such pure devotees, it is understood that they are specifically dearer than the impersonalists. The relationship of the pure devotees with the Lord develops because of devotional service to the Lord on the authentic basis of Vedic authority. Such pure devotees are not mundane sentimentalists, but are factually realists because their activities are supported by the Vedic authorities who have given aural reception to the facts mentioned in the Vedic literatures. The word paray\u0101 is very significant. Par\u0101 bhakti, or spontaneous love of God, is the basis of an intimate relationship with the Lord. This highest stage of relationship with the Lord can be attained simply by hearing about Him (His name, form, quality, etc.) from authentic sources like Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, recited by pure, unalloyed devotees of the Lord."

Everyone in the material world is full of thoughts about how to maintain his family, how to protect his wealth, how to keep pace with friends and relatives, etc. Thus he is always in fear and lamentation, trying to keep up with the status quo. In answer to this question, this verse spoken by Brahm\u0101 is very appropriate. A pure devotee of the Lord never thinks of himself as the proprietor of his home. He surrenders everything unto the supreme control of the Lord, and thus he has no fear for maintaining his family or protecting the interests of his family. Because of this surrender, he no longer has any attraction for wealth. Even if there is attraction for wealth, it is not for sense enjoyment, but for the service of the Lord. A pure devotee may be attracted to accumulating wealth just like an ordinary man, but the difference is that a devotee acquires money for the service of the Lord, whereas the ordinary man acquires money for his sense enjoyment. Thus the acquisition of wealth by a devotee is not a source of anxieties, as is the case for a worldly man. And because a pure devotee accepts everything in the sense of serving the Lord, the poisonous teeth of accumulation of wealth are extracted. If a snake has its poison removed and bites a man, there is no fatal effect. Similarly, wealth accumulated in the cause of the Lord has no poisonous teeth, and the effect is not fatal. A pure devotee is never entangled in material worldly affairs even though he may remain in the world like an ordinary man."

        "translation": "Such nondevotees engage their senses in very troublesome and extensive work, and they suffer insomnia at night because their intelligence constantly breaks their sleep with various mental speculations. They are frustrated in all their various plans by supernatural power. Even great sages, if they are against Your transcendental topics, must rotate in this material world.",
        "purport": " As described in the previous verse, people who have no taste for the devotional service of the Lord are occupied in material engagements. Most of them engage during the daytime in hard physical labor; their senses are engaged very extensively in troublesome duties in the gigantic plants of heavy industrial enterprise. The owners of such factories are engaged in finding a market for their industrial products, and the laborers are engaged in extensive production involving huge mechanical arrangements. \u201cFactory\u201d is another name for hell. At night, hellishly engaged persons take advantage of wine and women to satisfy their tired senses, but they are not even able to have sound sleep because their various mental speculative plans constantly interrupt their sleep. Because they suffer from insomnia sometimes they feel sleepy in the morning for lack of sufficient rest. By the arrangement of supernatural power, even the great scientists and thinkers of the world suffer frustration of their various plans and thus rot in the material world birth after birth. A great scientist may make discoveries in atomic energy for the quick destruction of the world and may be awarded the best prize in recognition of his service (or disservice), but he also has to undergo the reactions of his work by rotating in the cycle of repeated births and deaths under the superhuman law of material nature. All these people who are against the principle of devotional service are destined to rotate in this material world without fail. This verse particularly mentions that even sages who are averse to the principles of devotional service to the Lord are also condemned to undergo the terms of material existence. Not only in this age, but formerly also, there were many sages who tried to invent their own systems of religion without reference to devotional service to the Supreme Lord, but there cannot be any religious principle without devotional service to the Lord. The Supreme Lord is the leader of the entire range of living entities, and no one can be equal to or greater than Him. Even the Lord\u2019s impersonal feature and all-pervading localized feature cannot be on an equal level with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, there cannot be any religion or system of genuine philosophy for the advancement of the living entities without the principle of devotional service. The impersonalists, who take much trouble in penance and austerity for self-liberation, may approach the impersonal brahmajyoti, but ultimately, because of not being situated in devotional service, they glide down again to the material world to undergo another term of material existence. This is confirmed as follows: \u201cPersons who are falsely under the impression of being liberated, without devotional service to the Lord, may reach the goal of the brahmajyoti, but because of their impure consciousness and for want of shelter in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas, such so-called liberated persons again fall down into material existence.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.2.32) Therefore, no one can manufacture any system of religion without the principle of devotional service to the Lord. As we find in the Sixth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the initiator of religious principles is the Lord Himself. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also we find that the Lord condemns all forms of religion other than that which entails the process of surrendering unto the Supreme. Any system which leads one to the devotional service of the Lord, and nothing else, is actually religion or philosophy. In the Sixth Canto we find the following statements of Yamar\u0101ja, the controller of all unfaithful living entities: \u201cThe principles of religion are initiated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one else, including the sages and demigods, can manufacture any such principles. Since even great sages and demigods are unauthorized to inaugurate such principles of religion, what to speak of others \u2014 the so-called mystics, demons, human beings, Vidy\u0101dharas and C\u0101ra\u1e47as living in the lower planets? Twelve personalities \u2014 Brahm\u0101, N\u0101rada, Lord \u015aiva, Kum\u0101ra, Kapila, Manu, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Janaka Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Bali, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Yamar\u0101ja \u2014 are agents of the Lord authorized to speak and propagate the principles of religion.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 6.3.19-21) The principles of religion are not open to any ordinary living entity. They are just to bring the human being onto the platform of morality. Nonviolence, etc., are necessary for misguided persons because unless one is moral and nonviolent one cannot understand the principles of religion. To understand what is actually religion is very difficult even if one is situated in the principles of morality and nonviolence. It is very confidential because as soon as one is conversant with the real principles of religion, he is at once liberated to the eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Therefore, one who is not situated in the principles of devotional service to the Lord should not pose himself as a religious leader of the innocent public. The \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad emphatically forbids this nonsense in the following mantra: A person in ignorance of the principles of religion, who therefore does nothing in the matter of religion, is far better than a person who misguides others in the name of religion without reference to the factual religious principles of devotional service. Such so-called leaders of religion are sure to be condemned by Brahm\u0101 and other great authorities."

        "translation": "O my Lord, Your devotees can see You through the ears by the process of bona fide hearing, and thus their hearts become cleansed, and You take Your seat there. You are so merciful to Your devotees that You manifest Yourself in the particular eternal form of transcendence in which they always think of You.",
        "purport": " The statement here that the Lord manifests Himself before the devotee in the form in which the devotee likes to worship Him indicates that the Lord becomes subordinate to the desire of the devotee \u2014 so much so that He manifests His particular form as the devotee demands. This demand of the devotee is satisfied by the Lord because He is pliable in terms of the transcendental loving service of the devotee. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.11): ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham. We should note, however, that the Lord is never the order supplier of the devotee. Here in this verse it is particularly mentioned: tva\u1e41 bhakti-yoga-paribh\u0101vita. This indicates the efficiency achieved through execution of matured devotional service, or prema, love of Godhead. This state of prema is achieved by the gradual process of development from faith to love. On faith one associates with bona fide devotees, and by such association one can become engaged in bona fide devotional service, which includes proper initiation and the execution of the primary devotional duties prescribed in the revealed scriptures. This is clearly indicated herein by the word \u015brutek\u1e63ita. The \u015brutek\u1e63ita path is to hear from bona fide devotees who are conversant with Vedic wisdom, free from mundane sentiment. By this bona fide hearing process, the neophyte devotee becomes cleansed of all material rubbish, and thus he becomes attached to one of the many transcendental forms of the Lord, as described in the Vedas. This attachment of the devotee to a particular form of the Lord is due to natural inclination. Each and every living entity is originally attached to a particular type of transcendental service because he is eternally the servitor of the Lord. Lord Caitanya says that the living entity is eternally a servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, every living entity has a particular type of service relationship with the Lord, eternally. This particular attachment is invoked by practice of regulative devotional service to the Lord, and thus the devotee becomes attached to the eternal form of the Lord, exactly like one who is already eternally attached. This attachment for a particular form of the Lord is called svar\u016bpa-siddhi. The Lord sits on the lotus heart of the devotee in the eternal form the pure devotee desires, and thus the Lord does not part from the devotee, as confirmed in the previous verse. The Lord, however, does not disclose Himself to a casual or unauthentic worshiper to be exploited. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.25): n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sarvasya yoga-m\u0101y\u0101-sam\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25. Rather, by yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, the Lord remains concealed to the nondevotees or casual devotees who are serving their sense gratification. The Lord is never visible to the pseudodevotees who worship the demigods in charge of universal affairs. The conclusion is that the Lord cannot become the order supplier of a pseudodevotee, but He is always prepared to respond to the desires of a pure, unconditional devotee, who is free from all tinges of material infection."

        "translation": "My Lord, You are not very much satisfied by the worship of the demigods, who arrange for Your worship very pompously, with various paraphernalia, but who are full of material hankerings. You are situated in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul just to show Your causeless mercy, and You are the eternal well-wisher, but You are unavailable for the nondevotee.",
        "purport": " The demigods in the celestial heavenly planets, who are appointed administrators of the material affairs, are also devotees of the Lord. But, at the same time, they have desires for material opulence and sense gratification. The Lord is so kind that He awards them all sorts of material happiness, more than they can desire, but He is not satisfied with them because they are not pure devotees. The Lord does not want any one of His innumerable sons (the living entities) to remain in the material world of threefold miseries to perpetually suffer the material pangs of birth, death, old age and disease. The demigods in the heavenly planets, and many devotees on this planet also, want to remain in the material world as devotees of the Lord and take advantage of material happiness. They do so at a risk of falling down to the lower status of existence, and this makes the Lord dissatisfied with them. Pure devotees are not desirous of any material enjoyment, nor are they averse to it. They completely dovetail their desires with the desires of the Lord and perform nothing on their personal account. Arjuna is a good example. On his own sentiment, due to family affection, Arjuna did not want to fight, but finally, after hearing \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, he agreed to fight in the interests of the Lord. Therefore, the Lord is very much satisfied with pure devotees because they do not act for sense gratification but only in terms of the Lord\u2019s desire. As Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul, He is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, always giving everyone the chance of good counsel. Thus everyone should take the opportunity and render transcendental loving service to Him wholly and solely. The nondevotees, however, are neither like the demigods nor like the pure devotees, but are averse to the transcendental relationship with the Lord. They have revolted against the Lord and must perpetually undergo the reactions of their own activities. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.11) states: ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham. \u201cAlthough the Lord is equally kind to every living being, the living beings, for their own part, are able to please the Lord to either a greater or lesser extent.\u201d The demigods are called sak\u0101ma devotees, or devotees with material desires in mind, while the pure devotees are called ni\u1e63k\u0101ma devotees because they have no desires for their personal interests. The sak\u0101ma devotees are self-interested because they do not think of others, and therefore they are not able to satisfy the Lord perfectly, whereas the pure devotees take the missionary responsibility of turning nondevotees into devotees, and they are therefore able to satisfy the Lord more than the demigods. The Lord is unmindful of the nondevotees, although He is sitting within everyone\u2019s heart as well-wisher and Supersoul. However, He also gives them the chance to receive His mercy through His pure devotees who are engaged in missionary activities. Sometimes the Lord Himself descends for missionary activities, as He did in the form of Lord Caitanya, but mostly He sends His bona fide representatives, and thus He shows His causeless mercy towards the nondevotees. The Lord is so satisfied with His pure devotees that He wants to give them the credit for missionary success, although He could do the work personally. This is the sign of His satisfaction with His pure, ni\u1e63k\u0101ma devotees, compared to the sak\u0101ma devotees. By such transcendental activities the Lord simultaneously becomes free from the charge of partiality and exhibits His pleasure with the devotees. Now a question arises: If the Lord is sitting in the hearts of nondevotees, why are they not moved to become devotees? It may be answered that the stubborn nondevotees are like the barren land or alkaline field, where no agricultural activities can be successful. As part and parcel of the Lord, every individual living entity has a minute quantity of independence, and by misuse of this minute independence, the nondevotees commit offense after offense, to both the Lord and His pure devotees engaged in missionary work. As a result of such acts, they become as barren as an alkaline field, where there is no strength to produce."

But the process according to the Vedic injunctions is that the fruits of all pious activities should be offered to the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.27), the Lord demands that whatever one may do in one\u2019s daily activities, such as worship, sacrifice, and offering charity, all the results should be offered to Him only. This offering of the results of pious acts unto the Supreme Lord is a sign of devotional service to the Lord and is of permanent value, whereas enjoying the same results for oneself is only temporary. Anything done on account of the Lord is a permanent asset and accumulates in the form of unseen piety for gradual promotion to the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. These undetected pious activities will one day result in full-fledged devotional service by the grace of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, any pious act done on account of the Supreme Lord is also recommended here for those who are not pure devotees."

When the Lord appeared as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He played the part of the son of Ya\u015bod\u0101 and Nanda, and He lifted the Govardhana Hill, although lifting a hill is not His concern. He can lift millions of Govardhana Hills by His simple desire; He does not need to lift it with His hand. But He imitates the ordinary living entity by this lifting, and at the same time He exhibits His supernatural power. Thus His name is chanted as the lifter of Govardhana Hill, or \u015ar\u012b Govardhana-dh\u0101r\u012b. Therefore, His acts in His incarnations and His partiality to the devotees are all imitations only, just like the stage makeup of an expert dramatical player. His acts in that capacity, however, are all omnipotent, and the remembrance of such activities of the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is as powerful as the Lord Himself. Aj\u0101mila remembered the holy name of the Lord, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, by merely calling the name of his son N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and that gave him a complete opportunity to achieve the highest perfection of life."

        "translation": "Your Lordship is the prime root of the tree of the planetary systems. This tree has grown by first penetrating the material nature in three trunks \u2014 as me, \u015aiva and You, the Almighty \u2014 for creation, maintenance and dissolution, and we three have grown with many branches. Therefore I offer my obeisances unto You, the tree of the cosmic manifestation.",
        "purport": " The cosmic manifestation is grossly divided into three worlds, the upper, lower and middle planetary systems, and then it broadens into the cosmos of fourteen planetary systems, with the manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the supreme root. Material nature, which appears to be the cause of the cosmic manifestation, is only the agency or energy of the Lord. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10): may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram. \u201cOnly under the superintendence of the Supreme Lord does material nature appear to be the cause of all creation, maintenance and dissolution.\u201d The Lord expands Himself into three \u2014 Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva \u2014 for maintenance, creation and destruction respectively. Of the three principal agents controlling the three modes of material nature, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Almighty; even though He is within material nature for the purpose of maintenance, He is not controlled by the laws of material nature. The other two, Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, although almost as greatly powerful as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, are within the control of the material energy of the Supreme Lord. The conception of many gods controlling the many departments of material nature is ill conceived of by the foolish pantheist. God is one without a second, and He is the primal cause of all causes. As there are many departmental heads of governmental affairs, so there are many heads of management of the universal affairs. Due to a poor fund of knowledge, the impersonalist does not believe in the personal management of things as they are. But in this verse it is clearly explained that everything is personal and nothing is impersonal. We have already discussed this point in the Introduction, and it is confirmed here in this verse. The tree of the material manifestation is described in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as an a\u015bvattha tree whose root is upward. We have actual experience of such a tree when we see the shadow of a tree on the bank of a reservoir of water. The reflection of the tree on the water appears to hang down from its upward roots. The tree of creation described here is only a shadow of the reality which is Parabrahman, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the internal potency manifested in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas, the actual tree exists, and the tree reflected in the material nature is only the shadow of this actual tree. The impersonalists\u2019 theory that Brahman is void of all variegatedness is false because the shadow-tree described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 cannot exist without being the reflection of a real tree. The real tree is situated in the eternal existence of spiritual nature, full of transcendental varieties, and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the root of that tree also. The root is the same \u2014 the Lord \u2014 both for the real tree and the false, but the false tree is only the perverted reflection of the real tree. The Lord, being the real tree, is here offered obeisances by Brahm\u0101 on his own behalf and also on behalf of Lord \u015aiva."

As long as their tendency for foolish work remains powerful, all their plans in the struggle for existence will be cut to pieces. I therefore offer my obeisances unto Him who acts as eternal time.",
        "purport": " People in general are all engaged in senseless work. They are systematically unmindful of the real beneficial work, which is the devotional service of the Lord, technically called the arcan\u0101 regulations. The arcan\u0101 regulations are directly instructed by the Lord in the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra and are strictly followed by the intelligent men, who know well that the highest perfectional goal of life is to reach Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is the root of the tree called the cosmic manifestation. Also, in the Bh\u0101gavatam and in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 such regulative activities are clearly mentioned. Foolish people do not know that their self-interest is in realization of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Bh\u0101gavatam (7.5.30-32) says: \u201cPersons who are determined to totally rot in false, material happiness cannot become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-minded either by instructions from teachers, by self-realization or by parliamentary discussions. They are dragged by the unbridled senses into the darkest region of ignorance, and thus they madly engage in what is called \u2018chewing the chewed.\u2019 \u201cBecause of their foolish activities, they are unaware that the ultimate goal of human life is to achieve Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Lord of the cosmic manifestation, and so their struggle for existence is in the wrong direction of material civilization, which is under the external energy. They are led by similar foolish persons, just as one blind man is led by another blind man and both fall in the ditch. \u201cSuch foolish men cannot be attracted towards the activities of the Supreme Powerful, who is actually the neutralizing measure for their foolish activities, unless and until they have the good sense to be guided by the great souls who are completely freed from material attachment.\u201d In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord asks everyone to give up all other occupational duties and absolutely engage in arcan\u0101 activities, or in pleasing the Lord. But almost no one is attracted to such arcan\u0101 activity. Everyone is more or less attracted by activities which are conditions of rebellion against the Supreme Lord. The systems of j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga are also indirectly rebellious acts against the Lord. There is no auspicious activity except arcan\u0101 of the Lord. J\u00f1\u0101na and yoga are sometimes accepted within the purview of arcan\u0101 when the ultimate aim is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and not otherwise. The conclusion is that only the devotees of the Lord are bona fide human beings eligible for salvation. Others are vainly struggling for existence without any actual benefit."

        "purport": " Brahm\u0101 is teaching us the beginning of arcan\u0101 regulations from morning (four o\u2019clock) to night (ten o\u2019clock). Early in the morning, the devotee has to rise from his bed and pray to the Lord, and there are other regulative principles for offering ma\u1e45gala-\u0101rati early in the morning. Foolish nondevotees, not understanding the importance of arcan\u0101, criticize the regulative principles, but they have no eyes to see that the Lord also sleeps, by His own will. The impersonal conception of the Supreme is so detrimental to the path of devotional service that it is very difficult to associate with the stubborn nondevotees, who always think in terms of material conceptions. Impersonalists always think backwards. They think that because there is form in matter, spirit should be formless; because in matter there is sleep, in spirit there cannot be sleep; and because the sleeping of the Deity is accepted in arcan\u0101 worship, the arcan\u0101 is m\u0101y\u0101. All these thoughts are basically material. To think either positively or negatively is still thinking materially. Knowledge accepted from the superior source of the Vedas is standard. Here in these verses of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, we find that arcan\u0101 is recommended. Before Brahm\u0101 took up the task of creation, he found the Lord sleeping on the serpent bed in the waves of the water of devastation. Therefore, sleeping exists in the internal potency of the Lord, and this is not denied by pure devotees of the Lord like Brahm\u0101 and his disciplic succession. It is clearly said here that the Lord slept very happily within the violent waves of the water, manifesting thereby that He is able to do anything and everything by His transcendental will and not be hampered by any circumstances. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b cannot think beyond this material experience, and thus he denies the Lord\u2019s ability to sleep within the water. His mistake is that he compares the Lord to himself \u2014 and that comparison is also a material thought. The whole philosophy of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da school, based on \u201cnot this, not that\u201d (neti, neti), is basically material. Such thought cannot give one the chance to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is."

        "purport": " In the matter of material creation, maintenance and destruction, there are three incarnations of the material modes of nature \u2014 Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Mahe\u015bvara. But the Lord\u2019s incarnation as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, in His internal potency, is the supreme energy for the total activities. Brahm\u0101, who is only an assistant in the modes of creation, wanted to remain in his actual position as an instrument of the Lord instead of becoming puffed up by the false prestige of thinking himself the creator. That is the way of becoming dear to the Supreme Lord and receiving His benediction. Foolish men want to take credit for all creations made by them, but intelligent persons know very well that not a blade of grass can move without the will of the Lord; thus all the credit for wonderful creations must go to Him. By spiritual consciousness only can one be free from the contamination of material affection and receive the benedictions offered by the Lord."

Brahm\u0101 wants to be protected by the Lord because he has to contact many, many vicious living entities. An ordinary br\u0101hma\u1e47a may fall from the brahma-tejas, or the power of brahminical excellence, due to his association with many fallen, conditioned souls. Brahm\u0101, as the supermost br\u0101hma\u1e47a, is afraid of such a falldown, and therefore he prays to the Lord for protection. This is a warning for one and all in the spiritual advancement of life. Unless one is sufficiently protected by the Lord, he may fall down from his spiritual position; therefore one has to pray constantly to the Lord for protection and the blessing to carry out one\u2019s duty. Lord Caitanya also entrusted His missionary work to His devotees and assured them of His protection against the onslaught of material affection. The path of spiritual life is stated in the Vedas to be like the edge of a sharpened razor. A little inattentiveness may at once create havoc and bloodshed, but one who is a completely surrendered soul, always seeking protection from the Lord in the discharge of his entrusted duties, has no fear of falling into material contamination."

The personalities of the individual souls are His separated expansions, whereas the self-expansions are the Lord Himself. The self-expansions are predominators, and the separated expansions are predominated for reciprocation of transcendental bliss with the supreme form of bliss and knowledge. The liberated souls can join in this blissful reciprocation of predominator and predominated without materially concocted ideas. The typical example of such a transcendental exchange between the predominator and the predominated is the Lord\u2019s r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101 with the gop\u012bs. The gop\u012bs are predominated expansions of the internal potency, and therefore the Lord\u2019s participation in the r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101 dance is never to be considered like the mundane relationship of man and woman. It is, rather, the highest perfectional stage of the exchange of feelings between the Lord and the living entities. The Lord gives the fallen souls the chance for this highest perfection of life. Lord Brahm\u0101 is entrusted with the management of the complete cosmic show, and therefore he prays that the Lord bestow His blessings upon him so that he may execute its purpose."

Arjuna was entrusted with the work of fighting on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and before he was so entrusted, the Lord had already arranged for his victory. But Arjuna was always conscious of his position as subordinate to the Lord, and thus he accepted Him as the supreme guide in his responsibility. Anyone who takes pride in doing responsible work but does not give credit to the Supreme Lord is certainly falsely proud and cannot execute anything nicely. Brahm\u0101 and persons in the line of his disciplic succession who follow in his footsteps are always successful in the discharge of loving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord."

In answer to that prayer, the Lord said that he should not think of existing without a relationship with His omnipotency. The example is given of the fire in wood. The fire kindled in wood is always the same, although the wood may be of different types. Similarly, the bodies within the material creation may be specifically different according to shape and quality, but the spirit souls within them are not different from one another. The quality of fire, warmth, is the same everywhere, and the spiritual spark, or part and parcel of the Supreme Spirit, is the same in every living being; thus the potency of the Lord is distributed all over His creation. This transcendental knowledge alone can save one from the contamination of material illusion. Since the Lord\u2019s potency is distributed everywhere, a pure soul, or devotee of the Lord, can see everything in relationship with the Lord, and therefore he has no affection for the outer coverings. That pure spiritual conception makes him immune to all contamination of material association. The pure devotee never forgets the touch of the Lord in all circumstances."

        "purport": " In the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu it is said that a person whose only desire is to render transcendental loving service to the Lord is a free person in any condition of material existence. That service attitude is the svar\u016bpa, or real form, of the living entity. Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, also confirms this statement by declaring that the real, spiritual form of the living entity is eternal servitorship to the Supreme Lord. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da school shudders at the thought of a service attitude in the living entity, not knowing that in the transcendental world the service of the Lord is based on transcendental love. Transcendental loving service is never to be compared to the forced service of the material world. In the material world, even if one is under the conception that he is no one\u2019s servant, he is still the servant of his senses, under the dictation of the material modes. Factually no one is master here in the material world, and therefore the servants of the senses have a very bad experience of servitude. They shudder at the thought of service because they have no knowledge of the transcendental position. In transcendental loving service, the servitor is as free as the Lord. The Lord is svar\u0101\u1e6d, or fully independent, and the servant is also fully independent, or svar\u0101\u1e6d, in the spiritual atmosphere because there is no forced service. There the transcendental loving service is due to spontaneous love. A reflected glimpse of such service is experienced in the service of the mother unto the son, the friend\u2019s service unto the friend, or the wife\u2019s service unto the husband. These reflections of service by friends, parents or wives are not forced, but are due only to love. Here in this material world, however, the loving service is only a reflection. The real service, or service in svar\u016bpa, is present in the transcendental world, in association with the Lord. The very same service in transcendental love can be practiced in devotion here. This verse is also applicable to the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b school. The enlightened j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, when free from all material contaminations, namely the gross and subtle bodies together with the senses of the material modes of nature, is placed in the Supreme and is thus liberated from material bondage. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and the devotees are actually in agreement up to the point of liberation from material contamination. But whereas the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs remain pacified on the platform of simple understanding, the devotees develop further spiritual advancement in loving service. The devotees develop a spiritual individuality in their spontaneous service attitude, which is enhanced on and on, up to the point of m\u0101dhurya-rasa, or transcendental loving service reciprocated between the lover and the beloved."

The perfection of any activity \u2014 social, political, religious or philanthropic \u2014 is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. This secret of success is known to the devotee of the Lord, as exemplified by Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. As a good, nonviolent man, Arjuna did not want to fight with his kinsmen, but when he understood that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted the fight and had arranged it at Kuruk\u1e63etra, he gave up his own satisfaction and fought for the satisfaction of the Lord. That is the right decision for all intelligent men. One\u2019s only concern should be to satisfy the Lord by one\u2019s activities. If the Lord is satisfied by an action, whatever it may be, then it is successful; otherwise, it is simply a waste of time. That is the standard of all sacrifice, penance, austerity, mystic trance and other good and pious work."

        "translation": "I am the Supersoul of every individual. I am the supreme director and the dearest. People are wrongly attached to the gross and subtle bodies, but they should be attached to Me only.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is the dearest in both the conditioned and liberated states. When a person does not know that the Lord is the only dearmost object, then he is in the conditioned state of life, and when one knows perfectly well that the Lord is the only dearmost object, he is considered to be liberated. There are degrees of knowing one\u2019s relationship with the Lord, depending on the degree of realization as to why the Supreme Lord is the dearmost object of every living being. The real reason is clearly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7). Mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25: the living entities are eternally parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. The living entity is called the \u0101tm\u0101, and the Lord is called the Param\u0101tm\u0101. The living entity is called Brahman, and the Lord is called the Parabrahman, or the Parame\u015bvara. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. The conditioned souls, who do not have self-realization, accept the material body as the dearmost. The idea of the dearmost is then spread all over the body, both concentrated and extended. The attachment for one\u2019s own body and its extensions like children and relatives is actually developed on the basis of the real living entity. As soon as the real living entity is out of the body, even the body of the most dear son is no longer attractive. Therefore the living spark, or eternal part of the Supreme, is the real basis of affection, and not the body. Because the living entities are also parts of the whole living entity, that supreme living entity is the factual basis of affection for all. One who has forgotten the basic principle of his love for everything has only flickering love because he is in m\u0101y\u0101. The more one is affected by the principle of m\u0101y\u0101, the more he is detached from the basic principle of love. One cannot factually love anything unless he is fully developed in the loving service of the Lord. In the present verse, stress is given to focusing love upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word kury\u0101t is significant here. This means \u201cone must have it.\u201d It is just to stress that we must have more and more attachment to the principle of love. The influence of m\u0101y\u0101 is experienced by the part and parcel spiritual entity, but it cannot influence the Supersoul, the Param\u0101tm\u0101. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, accepting the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 on the living entity, want to become one with the Param\u0101tm\u0101. But because they have no actual love for Param\u0101tm\u0101, they remain ever entrapped by the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 and are unable to approach the vicinity of Param\u0101tm\u0101. This inability is due to their lack of affection for the Param\u0101tm\u0101. A rich miser does not know how to utilize his wealth, and therefore, in spite of his being very rich, his miserly behavior keeps him everlastingly a poor man. On the other hand, a person who knows how to utilize wealth can quickly become a rich man, even with a small credit balance. The eyes and the sun are very intimately related because without sunlight the eyes are unable to see. But the other parts of the body, being attached to the sun as a source of warmth, take more advantage of the sun than do the eyes. Without possessing affection for the sun, the eyes cannot bear the rays of the sun; or, in other words, such eyes have no capacity to understand the utility of the sun\u2019s rays. Similarly, the empiric philosophers, despite their theoretical knowledge of Brahman, cannot utilize the mercy of the Supreme Brahman because they lack affection. So many impersonal philosophers remain everlastingly under the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 because, although they indulge in theoretical knowledge of Brahman, they do not develop affection for Brahman nor do they have any scope for development of affection because of their defective method. A devotee of the sun-god, even though devoid of eyesight, can see the sun-god as he is even from this planet, whereas one who is not a devotee of the sun cannot even bear the glaring sunlight. Similarly, by devotional service, even though one is not on the level of a j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, one can see the Personality of Godhead within himself due to his development of pure love. In all circumstances one should try to develop love of Godhead, and that will solve all contending problems."
