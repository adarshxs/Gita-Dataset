        "translation": "The Personality of Godhead said: My dear mother, O daughter of the King, now I shall explain to you the system of yoga, the object of which is to concentrate the mind. By practicing this system one can become joyful and progressively advance towards the path of the Absolute Truth.",
        "purport": " The yoga process explained by Lord Kapiladeva in this chapter is authorized and standard, and therefore these instructions should be followed very carefully. To begin, the Lord says that by yoga practice one can make progress towards understanding the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the previous chapter it has been clearly stated that the desired result of yoga is not to achieve some wonderful mystic power. One should not be at all attracted by such mystic power, but should attain progressive realization on the path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which states in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter that the greatest yog\u012b is he who constantly thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within himself, or he who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. It is stated here that by following the system of yoga one can become joyful. Lord Kapila, the Personality of Godhead, who is the highest authority on yoga, here explains the yoga system known as a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, which comprises eight different practices, namely yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na and sam\u0101dhi. By all these stages of practice one must realize Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is the target of all yoga. There are so-called yoga practices in which one concentrates the mind on voidness or on the impersonal, but this is not approved by the authorized yoga system as explained by Kapiladeva. Even Pata\u00f1jali explains that the target of all yoga is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga is therefore part of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava practice because its ultimate goal is realization of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The achievement of success in yoga is not acquisition of mystic power, which is condemned in the previous chapter, but, rather, freedom from all material designations and situation in one\u2019s constitutional position. That is the ultimate achievement in yoga practice."

        "purport": " In this verse there are many important words which could be very elaborately explained, but we shall briefly discuss the important aspects of each. The final statement is \u0101tmavic-cara\u1e47\u0101rcanam. \u0100tma-vit means a self-realized soul or bona fide spiritual master. Unless one is self-realized and knows what his relationship with the Supersoul is, he cannot be a bona fide spiritual master. Here it is recommended that one should seek out a bona fide spiritual master and surrender unto him (arcanam), for by inquiring from and worshiping him one can learn spiritual activities. The first recommendation is sva-dharm\u0101cara\u1e47am. As long as we have this material body there are various duties prescribed for us. Such duties are divided by a system of four social orders: br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra. These particular duties are mentioned in the \u015b\u0101stra, and particularly in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Sva-dharm\u0101cara\u1e47am means that one must discharge the prescribed duties of his particular division of society faithfully and to the best of his ability. One should not accept another\u2019s duty. If one is born in a particular society or community, he should perform the prescribed duties for that particular division. If, however, one is fortunate enough to transcend the designation of birth in a particular society or community by being elevated to the standard of spiritual identity, then his sva-dharma, or duty, is solely that of serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The actual duty of one who is advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to serve the Lord. As long as one remains in the bodily concept of life, he may act according to the duties of social convention, but if one is elevated to the spiritual platform, he must simply serve the Supreme Lord; that is the real execution of sva-dharma."

Religious practices should be executed only to gain freedom from the clutches of material nature. It is stated in the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that the topmost religious practice is that by which one can attain to the transcendental devotional service of the Lord, without reason or cause. Such religious practice is never hampered by any impediments, and by its performance one actually becomes satisfied. Here this is recommended as mok\u1e63a-dharma, religious practice for salvation, or transcendence of the clutches of material contamination. Generally people execute religious practices for economic development or sense gratification, but that is not recommended for one who wants to advance in yoga. The next important phrase is mita-medhy\u0101danam, which means that one should eat very frugally. It is recommended in the Vedic literatures that a yog\u012b eat only half what he desires according to his hunger. If one is so hungry that he could devour one pound of foodstuffs, then instead of eating one pound, he should consume only half a pound and supplement this with four ounces of water; one fourth of the stomach should be left empty for passage of air in the stomach. If one eats in this manner, he will avoid indigestion and disease. The yog\u012b should eat in this way, as recommended in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and all other standard scriptures. The yog\u012b should live in a secluded place, where his yoga practice will not be disturbed."

He should abstain from sex life, perform austerity, be clean, study the Vedas and worship the supreme form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " The word puru\u1e63\u0101rcanam in this verse means worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, especially the form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is confirmed by Arjuna that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original puru\u1e63a, or Personality of Godhead, puru\u1e63a\u1e41 \u015b\u0101\u015bvatam. Therefore in yoga practice one not only must concentrate his mind on the person of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but must also worship the form or Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a daily. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b practices celibacy, controlling his sex life. One cannot enjoy unrestricted sex life and practice yoga; this is rascaldom. So-called yog\u012bs advertise that one can go on enjoying as one likes and simultaneously become a yog\u012b, but this is totally unauthorized. It is very clearly explained here that one must observe celibacy. Brahmacaryam means that one leads his life simply in relationship with Brahman, or in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are too addicted to sex life cannot observe the regulations which will lead them to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sex life should be restricted to persons who are married. A person whose sex life is restricted in marriage is also called a brahmac\u0101r\u012b. The word asteyam is also very important for a yog\u012b. Asteyam means \u201cto refrain from theft.\u201d In the broader sense, everyone who accumulates more than he needs is a thief. According to spiritual communism, one cannot possess more than he needs for his personal maintenance. That is the law of nature. Anyone who accumulates more money or more possessions than he needs is called a thief, and one who simply accumulates wealth without spending for sacrifice or for worship of the Personality of Godhead is a great thief. Sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya\u1e25 means \u201creading the authorized Vedic scriptures.\u201d Even if one is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and is practicing the yoga system, he must read standard Vedic literatures in order to understand. Performance of yoga alone is not sufficient. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a great devotee and \u0101c\u0101rya in the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava samprad\u0101ya, says that all spiritual activities should be understood from three sources, namely saintly persons, standard scriptures and the spiritual master. These three guides are very important for progress in spiritual life. The spiritual master prescribes standard literature for the prosecution of the yoga of devotional service, and he himself speaks only from scriptural reference. Therefore reading standard scriptures is necessary for executing yoga. Practicing yoga without reading the standard literatures is simply a waste of time."

        "purport": " There are six circles of vital air circulation within the body. The first circle is within the belly, the second circle is in the area of the heart, the third is in the area of the lungs, the fourth is on the palate, the fifth is between the eyebrows, and the highest, the sixth circle, is above the brain. One has to fix his mind and the circulation of the vital air and thus think of the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Lord.

It is through the processes of devotional service, chanting and hearing of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that one can achieve this concentration. As described in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the Lord appears and disappears according to His relationships with different devotees. The Vedic literatures contain many narrations of the Lord\u2019s pastimes, including the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra and historical facts relating to the life and precepts of devotees like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. One need only concentrate his mind on one such narration and become always absorbed in its thought. Then he will be in sam\u0101dhi. Sam\u0101dhi is not an artificial bodily state; it is the state achieved when the mind is virtually absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

This is the general process of yoga. This same concentration can be achieved by other recommended processes, and therefore anyai\u015b ca, other methods, also can be applied. The essential point is that the mind, which is contaminated by material attraction, has to be bridled and concentrated on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It cannot be fixed on something void or impersonal. For this reason, so-called yoga practices of voidism and impersonalism are not recommended in any standard yoga-\u015b\u0101stra.

Or, reversing the process, the yogi can first exhale, then hold the breath outside, and finally inhale. This is done so that the mind may become steady and free from external disturbances.",
        "purport": " These breathing exercises are performed to control the mind and fix it on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25: the devotee Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja fixed his mind on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day. The process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and to hear the sound attentively so that the mind is fixed upon the transcendental vibration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, which is nondifferent from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the personality. The real purpose of controlling the mind by the prescribed method of clearing the passage of the life air is achieved immediately if one fixes his mind directly on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The ha\u1e6dha-yoga system, or breathing system, is especially recommended for those who are very absorbed in the concept of bodily existence, but one who can perform the simple process of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can fix the mind more easily. Three different activities are recommended for clearing the passage of breath: p\u016braka, kumbhaka and recaka. Inhaling the breath is called p\u016braka, sustaining it within is called kumbhaka, and finally exhaling it is called recaka. These recommended processes can also be performed in the reverse order. After exhaling, one can keep the air outside for some time and then inhale. The nerves through which inhalation and exhalation are conducted are technically called i\u1e0d\u0101 and pi\u1e45gal\u0101. The ultimate purpose of clearing the i\u1e0d\u0101 and pi\u1e45gal\u0101 passages is to divert the mind from material enjoyment. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one\u2019s mind is his enemy, and one\u2019s mind is also his friend; its position varies according to the different dealings of the living entity. If we divert our mind to thoughts of material enjoyment, then our mind becomes an enemy, and if we concentrate our mind on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then our mind is a friend. By the yoga system of p\u016braka, kumbhaka and recaka or by directly fixing the mind on the sound vibration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or on the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the same purpose is achieved. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that one must practice the breathing exercise (abhy\u0101sa-yoga-yuktena). By virtue of these processes of control, the mind cannot wander to external thoughts (cetas\u0101 n\u0101nya-g\u0101min\u0101). Thus one can fix his mind constantly on the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can attain (y\u0101ti) Him. Practicing the yoga system of exercise and breath control is very difficult for a person in this age, and therefore Lord Caitanya recommended, k\u012brtan\u012bya\u1e25 sad\u0101 hari\u1e25: one should always chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most suitable name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the Supreme Person K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are nondifferent. Therefore, if one concentrates his mind on hearing and chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the same result is achieved."

        "purport": " According to \u0100yurvedic medical science the three items kapha, pitta and v\u0101yu (phlegm, bile and air) maintain the physiological condition of the body. Modern medical science does not accept this physiological analysis as valid, but the ancient \u0100yurvedic process of treatment is based upon these items. \u0100yurvedic treatment concerns itself with the cause of these three elements, which are mentioned in many places in the Bh\u0101gavatam as the basic conditions of the body. Here it is recommended that by practicing the breathing process of pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma one can be released from contamination created by the principal physiological elements, by concentrating the mind one can become free from sinful activities, and by withdrawing the senses one can free himself from material association. Ultimately, one has to meditate on the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order to be elevated to the transcendental position where he is no longer affected by the three modes of material nature. It is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that one who engages himself in unalloyed devotional service at once becomes transcendental to the three modes of material nature and immediately realizes his identification with Brahman. Sa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate. For every item in the yoga system there is a parallel activity in bhakti-yoga, but the practice of bhakti-yoga is easier for this age. What was introduced by Lord Caitanya is not a new interpretation. Bhakti-yoga is a feasible process that begins with chanting and hearing. Bhakti-yoga and other yogas have as their ultimate goal the same Personality of Godhead, but one is practical, and the others are difficult. One has to purify his physiological condition by concentration and by restraint of the senses; then he can fix his mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is called sam\u0101dhi."

There are twelve different forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, which are described in Teachings of Lord Caitanya. One cannot concentrate his mind on anything void or impersonal; the mind should be fixed on the personal form of the Lord, whose attitude is cheerful, as described in this verse. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 states that meditation on the impersonal or void features is very troublesome to the meditator. Those who are attached to the impersonal or void features of meditation have to undergo a difficult process because we are not accustomed to concentrating our minds upon anything impersonal. Actually such concentration is not even possible. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms that one should concentrate his mind on the Personality of Godhead. The color of the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is described here as n\u012blotpala-dala, meaning that it is like that of a lotus flower with petals tinted blue and white. People always ask why K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is blue. The color of the Lord has not been imagined by an artist. It is described in authoritative scripture. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 also, the color of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is compared to that of a bluish cloud. The color of the Lord is not poetical imagination. There are authoritative descriptions in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and many of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as of the Lord\u2019s body, His weapons and all other paraphernalia. The Lord\u2019s appearance is described here as padma-garbh\u0101ru\u1e47ek\u1e63a\u1e47am. His eyes resemble the inside of a lotus flower, and in His four hands He holds the four symbols: conchshell, discus, mace and lotus."

Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form is so beautiful and pleasing to the heart of the devotee, He does not attract the impersonalists, who want to meditate on His impersonal aspect. Such impersonal meditation is simply fruitless labor. The actual yog\u012bs, with half-closed eyes, fix on the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not upon anything void or impersonal."

        "purport": " The word sarva-loka-namask\u1e5btam means that He is worshipable by everyone on every planet. There are innumerable planets in the material world and innumerable planets in the spiritual world as well. On each planet there are innumerable inhabitants who worship the Lord, for the Lord is worshipable by all but the impersonalists. The Supreme Lord is very beautiful. The word \u015ba\u015bvat is significant. It is not that He appears beautiful to the devotees but is ultimately impersonal. \u015aa\u015bvat means \u201cever existing.\u201d That beauty is not temporary. It is ever existing \u2014 He is always youthful. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.33) it is also stated: advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam \u0101dya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47a-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 nava-yauvana\u1e41 ca. He is one without a second, yet although He is the original person, He never appears old: He always appears as an ever-fresh, blooming youth. The Lord\u2019s facial expression always indicates that He is ready to show favor and benediction to the devotees; for the nondevotees, however, He is silent. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, although He acts equally to everyone because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and because all living entities are His sons, He is especially inclined to those engaged in devotional service. The same fact is confirmed here: He is always anxious to show favor to the devotees. Just as the devotees are always eager to render service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord is also very eager to bestow benediction upon the pure devotees."

        "translation": "The glory of the Lord is always worth singing, for His glories enhance the glories of His devotees. One should therefore meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead and upon His devotees. One should meditate on the eternal form of the Lord until the mind becomes fixed.",
        "purport": " One has to fix his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. When one is accustomed to thinking of one of the innumerable forms of the Lord \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, R\u0101ma, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, etc. \u2014 he has reached the perfection of yoga. This is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: a person who has developed pure love for the Lord, and whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of transcendental loving exchange, always sees within his heart the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotees especially see the Lord in the beautiful blackish form of \u015ay\u0101masundara. That is the perfection of yoga. This yoga system should be continued until the mind does not vacillate for a moment. O\u1e41 tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 pada\u1e41 sad\u0101 pa\u015byanti s\u016braya\u1e25: the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the highest individuality and is always visible to sages and saintly persons. The same purpose is served when a devotee worships the form of the Lord in the temple. There is no difference between devotional service in the temple and meditation on the form of the Lord, since the form of the Lord is the same whether He appears within the mind or in some concrete element. There are eight kinds of forms recommended for the devotees to see. The forms may be made out of sand, clay, wood or stone, they may be contemplated within the mind or made of jewels, metal or painted colors, but all the forms are of the same value. It is not that one who meditates on the form within the mind sees differently from one who worships the form in the temple. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is absolute, and there is therefore no difference between the two. The impersonalists, who desire to disregard the eternal form of the Lord, imagine some round figure. They especially prefer the o\u1e41k\u0101ra, which also has form. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated that o\u1e41k\u0101ra is the letter form of the Lord. Similarly, there are statue forms and painting forms of the Lord. Another significant word in this verse is pu\u1e47ya-\u015bloka-ya\u015baskaram. The devotee is called pu\u1e47ya-\u015bloka. As one becomes purified by chanting the holy name of the Lord, so one can become purified simply by chanting the name of a holy devotee. The pure devotee of the Lord and the Lord Himself are nondifferent. It is sometimes feasible to chant the name of a holy devotee. This is a very sanctified process. Lord Caitanya was once chanting the holy names of the gop\u012bs when His students criticized Him: \u201cWhy are You chanting the names of the gop\u012bs? Why not \u2018K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019?\u201d Lord Caitanya was irritated by the criticism, and so there was some misunderstanding between Him and His students. He wanted to chastise them for desiring to instruct Him on the transcendental process of chanting. The beauty of the Lord is that the devotees who are connected with His activities are also glorified. Arjuna, Prahl\u0101da, Janaka Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and many other devotees were not even in the renounced order of life, but were householders. Some of them, such as Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, were born of demoniac families. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s father was a demon, and Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the grandson of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, but still they have become famous because of their association with the Lord. Anyone who is eternally associated with the Lord is glorified with the Lord. The conclusion is that a perfect yog\u012b should always be accustomed to seeing the form of the Lord, and unless the mind is fixed in that way, he should continue practicing yoga."

When there is sound vibrated praising the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, however, one is forced to hear. That hearing process enters into the mind, and the practice of yoga is automatically performed. For example, even a child can hear and derive the benefit of meditating on the pastimes of the Lord simply by listening to a reading from the Bh\u0101gavatam that describes the Lord as He is going to the pasturing ground with His cows and friends. Hearing includes applying the mind. In this Age of Kali-yuga, Lord Caitanya has recommended that one should always engage in chanting and hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord also says that the mah\u0101tm\u0101s, or great souls, always engage in the process of chanting the glories of the Lord, and just by hearing, others derive the same benefit. Yoga necessitates meditation on the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, whether He is standing, moving, lying down, etc."

If a yog\u012b looks upon the marks of the Lord\u2019s sole and on the blazing brilliance of His nails, then he can be freed from the darkness of ignorance in material existence. This liberation is not achieved by mental speculation, but by seeing the light emanating from the lustrous toenails of the Lord. In other words, one has to fix his mind first on the lotus feet of the Lord if he wants to be freed from the darkness of ignorance in material existence."

        "translation": "The blessed Lord \u015aiva becomes all the more blessed by bearing on his head the holy waters of the Ganges, which has its source in the water that washed the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. The Lord\u2019s feet act like thunderbolts hurled to shatter the mountain of sin stored in the mind of the meditating devotee. One should therefore meditate on the lotus feet of the Lord for a long time.",
        "purport": " In this verse the position of Lord \u015aiva is specifically mentioned. The impersonalist suggests that the Absolute Truth has no form and that one can therefore equally imagine the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or Lord \u015aiva or the goddess Durg\u0101 or their son Ga\u1e47e\u015ba. But actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme master of everyone. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 5.142) it is said, ekale \u012b\u015bvara k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, ara saba bh\u1e5btya: the Supreme Lord is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and everyone else, including Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 \u2014 not to mention other demigods \u2014 is a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The same principle is described here. Lord \u015aiva is important because he is holding on his head the holy Ganges water, which has its origin in the foot-wash of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa, by San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, it is said that anyone who puts the Supreme Lord and the demigods, including Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101, on the same level, at once becomes a p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b, or atheist. We should never consider that the Supreme Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and the demigods are on an equal footing. Another significant point of this verse is that the mind of the conditioned soul, on account of its association with the material energy from time immemorial, contains heaps of dirt in the form of desires to lord it over material nature. This dirt is like a mountain, but a mountain can be shattered when hit by a thunderbolt. Meditating on the lotus feet of the Lord acts like a thunderbolt on the mountain of dirt in the mind of the yog\u012b. If a yog\u012b wants to shatter the mountain of dirt in his mind, he should concentrate on the lotus feet of the Lord and not imagine something void or impersonal. Because the dirt has accumulated like a solid mountain, one must meditate on the lotus feet of the Lord for quite a long time. For one who is accustomed to thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord constantly, however, it is a different matter. The devotees are so fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord that they do not think of anything else. Those who practice the yoga system must meditate on the lotus feet of the Lord for a long time after following the regulative principles and thereby controlling the senses. It is specifically mentioned here, bhagavata\u015b cara\u1e47\u0101ravindam: one has to think of the lotus feet of the Lord. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs imagine that one can think of the lotus feet of Lord \u015aiva or Lord Brahm\u0101 or the goddess Durg\u0101 to achieve liberation, but this is not so. Bhagavata\u1e25 is specifically mentioned. Bhagavata\u1e25 means \u201cof the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u,\u201d and no one else. Another significant phrase in this verse is \u015biva\u1e25 \u015bivo\u00a0\u2019bh\u016bt. By his constitutional position, Lord \u015aiva is always great and auspicious, but since he has accepted on his head the Ganges water, which emanated from the lotus feet of the Lord, he has become even more auspicious and important. The stress is on the lotus feet of the Lord. A relationship with the lotus feet of the Lord can even enhance the importance of Lord \u015aiva, what to speak of other, ordinary living entities."

        "translation": "The yog\u012b should fix in his heart the activities of Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the goddess of fortune, who is worshiped by all demigods and is the mother of the supreme person, Brahm\u0101. She can always be found massaging the legs and thighs of the transcendental Lord, very carefully serving Him in this way.",
        "purport": " Brahm\u0101 is the appointed lord of the universe. Because his father is Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the goddess of fortune, is automatically his mother. Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b is worshiped by all demigods and by the inhabitants of other planets as well. Human beings are also eager to receive favor from the goddess of fortune. Lak\u1e63m\u012b is always engaged in massaging the legs and thighs of the Supreme Personality of Godhead N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, who is lying on the ocean of Garbha within the universe. Brahm\u0101 is described here as the son of the goddess of fortune, but actually he was not born of her womb. Brahm\u0101 takes his birth from the abdomen of the Lord Himself. A lotus flower grows from the abdomen of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and Brahm\u0101 is born there. Therefore Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b\u2019s massaging of the thighs of the Lord should not be taken as the behavior of an ordinary wife. The Lord is transcendental to the behavior of the ordinary male and female. The word abhavasya is very significant, for it indicates that He could produce Brahm\u0101 without the assistance of the goddess of fortune. Since transcendental behavior is different from mundane behavior, it should not be taken that the Lord receives service from His wife just as a demigod or human being might receive service from his wife. It is advised here that the yog\u012b always keep this picture in his heart. The devotee always thinks of this relationship between Lak\u1e63m\u012b and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; therefore he does not meditate on the mental plane as impersonalists and voidists do. Bhava means \u201cone who accepts a material body,\u201d and abhava means \u201cone who does not accept a material body but descends in the original, spiritual body.\u201d Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is not born of anything material. Matter is generated from matter, but He is not born of matter. Brahm\u0101 is born after the creation, but since the Lord existed before the creation, the Lord has no material body."

His whole body is full of opulences: all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation. The yog\u012b is advised to meditate upon the transcendental form of the Lord, beginning from the soles of the feet and then gradually rising to the knees, to the thighs, and finally arriving at the face. The system of meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins from His feet. The description of the transcendental form of the Lord is exactly represented in the arc\u0101-vigraha, the statue in the temples. Generally, the lower part of the body of the statue of the Lord is covered with yellow silk. That is the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha dress, or the dress the Lord wears in the spiritual sky. This cloth extends down to the Lord\u2019s ankles. Thus, since the yog\u012b has so many transcendental objectives on which to meditate, there is no reason for his meditating on something imaginary, as is the practice of the so-called yog\u012bs whose objective is impersonal."

From His navel, which is the foundation of the entire universe, sprang the lotus stem containing all the different planetary systems. The lotus is the residence of Brahm\u0101, the first created being. In the same way, the yog\u012b should concentrate his mind on the Lord\u2019s nipples, which resemble a pair of most exquisite emeralds and which appear whitish because of the rays of the milk-white pearl necklaces adorning His chest.",
        "purport": " The yog\u012b is advised next to meditate upon the navel of the Lord, which is the foundation of all material creation. Just as a child is connected to his mother by the umbilical cord, so the first-born living creature, Brahm\u0101, by the supreme will of the Lord, is connected to the Lord by a lotus stem. In the previous verse it was stated that the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, who engages in massaging the legs, ankles and thighs of the Lord, is called the mother of Brahm\u0101, but actually Brahm\u0101 is born from the abdomen of the Lord, not from the abdomen of his mother. These are inconceivable conceptions of the Lord, and one should not think materially, \u201cHow can the father give birth to a child?\u201d It is explained in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 that each limb of the Lord has the potency of every other limb; because everything is spiritual, His parts are not conditioned. The Lord can see with His ears. The material ear can hear but cannot see, but we understand from the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 that the Lord can also see with His ears and hear with His eyes. Any organ of His transcendental body can function as any other organ. His abdomen is the foundation of all the planetary systems. Brahm\u0101 holds the post of the creator of all planetary systems, but his engineering energy is generated from the abdomen of the Lord. Any creative function in the universe always has a direct connecting link with the Lord. The necklace of pearls which decorates the upper portion of the Lord\u2019s body is also spiritual, and therefore the yog\u012b is advised to gaze at the whitish luster of the pearls decorating His chest."

        "translation": "The yog\u012b should then meditate on the chest of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the abode of goddess Mah\u0101-Lak\u1e63m\u012b. The Lord\u2019s chest is the source of all transcendental pleasure for the mind and full satisfaction for the eyes. The yog\u012b should then imprint on his mind the neck of the Personality of Godhead, who is adored by the entire universe. The neck of the Lord serves to enhance the beauty of the Kaustubha gem, which hangs on His chest.",
        "purport": " In the Upani\u1e63ads it is said that the various energies of the Lord are working to create, destroy and maintain. These inconceivable varieties of energy are stored in the bosom of the Lord. As people generally say, God is all-powerful. That prowess is represented by Mah\u0101-Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the reservoir of all energies, who is situated on the bosom of the transcendental form of the Lord. The yog\u012b who can meditate perfectly on that spot on the transcendental form of the Lord can derive many material powers, which comprise the eight perfections of the yoga system. It is stated herein that the beauty of the neck of the Lord enhances the beauty of the Kaustubha gem rather than vice versa. The gem itself becomes more beautiful because it is situated on the neck of the Lord. A yog\u012b is therefore recommended to meditate upon the Lord\u2019s neck. The Lord\u2019s transcendental form can either be meditated upon in the mind or placed in a temple in the form of a statue and decorated in such a way that everyone can contemplate it. Temple worship is therefore meant for persons who are not so advanced that they can meditate upon the form of the Lord. There is no difference between constantly visiting the temple and directly seeing the transcendental form of the Lord; they are of equal value. The advantageous position of the yog\u012b is that he can sit anywhere in a solitary place and meditate upon the form of the Lord. A less advanced person, however, has to go to the temple, and as long as he does not go to the temple he is unable to see the form of the Lord. Either by hearing, seeing or meditating, the objective is the transcendental form of the Lord; there is no question of voidness or impersonalism. The Lord can bestow the blessings of transcendental pleasure upon either the visitor of the temple, the meditator-yog\u012b or one who hears about the Lord\u2019s transcendental form from scriptures like the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam or Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. There are nine processes for executing devotional service, of which smara\u1e47am, or meditation, is one. Yog\u012bs take advantage of the process of smara\u1e47am, whereas bhakti-yog\u012bs take special advantage of the process of hearing and chanting."

        "purport": " The Lord descends to the material world out of His deep compassion for His devotees. There are two reasons for the Lord\u2019s appearance or incarnation in the material world. Whenever there is a discrepancy in the discharge of religious principles and there is prominence of irreligion, the Lord descends for the protection of the devotees and the destruction of the nondevotees. When He appears, His main purpose is to give solace to His devotees. He does not have to come Himself to destroy the demons, for He has many agents; even the external energy, m\u0101y\u0101, has sufficient strength to kill them. But when He comes to show compassion to His devotees, He kills the nondevotees as a matter of course. The Lord appears in the particular form loved by a particular type of devotee. There are millions of forms of the Lord, but they are one Absolute. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam: all the different forms of the Lord are one, but some devotees want to see Him in the form of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, others prefer Him as S\u012bt\u0101 and R\u0101macandra, others would see Him as Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and others want to see Him as four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva. The Lord has innumerable forms, and He appears in a particular form as preferred by a particular type of devotee. A yog\u012b is advised to meditate upon the forms that are approved by devotees. A yog\u012b cannot imagine a form for meditation. Those so-called yog\u012bs who manufacture a circle or target are engaged in nonsense. Actually, a yog\u012b must meditate upon the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that has been experienced by the Lord\u2019s pure devotees. Yog\u012b means devotee. Yog\u012bs who are not actually pure devotees should follow in the footsteps of devotees. It is especially mentioned here that the yog\u012b should meditate upon the form which is thus approved; he cannot manufacture a form of the Lord."

        "purport": " One important statement here is dhy\u0101yen manomayam. Manomayam is not imagination. Impersonalists think that the yog\u012b can imagine any form he likes, but, as stated here, the yog\u012b must meditate upon the form of the Lord which is experienced by devotees. Devotees never imagine a form of the Lord. They are not satisfied by something imaginary. The Lord has different eternal forms; each devotee likes a particular form and thus engages himself in the service of the Lord by worshiping that form. The Lord\u2019s form is depicted in different ways according to scriptures. As already discussed, there are eight kinds of representations of the original form of the Lord. These representations can be produced by the use of clay, stone, wood, paint, sand, etc., depending upon the resources of the devotee. Manomayam is a carving of the form of the Lord within the mind. This is included as one of the eight different carvings of the form of the Lord. It is not imagination. Meditation on the actual form of the Lord may be manifested in different manners, but one should not conclude that one has to imagine a form. There are two comparisons in this verse: first the Lord\u2019s face is compared to a lotus, and then His black hair is compared to humming bees swarming around the lotus, and His two eyes are compared to two fish swimming about. A lotus flower on the water is very beautiful when surrounded by humming bees and fish. The Lord\u2019s face is self-sufficient and complete. His beauty defies the natural beauty of a lotus."

It is stated in this verse that the charming eyebrows of the Lord are so fascinating that they cause one to forget the charms of sense attraction. The conditioned souls are shackled to material existence because they are captivated by the charms of sense gratification, especially sex life. The sex-god is called Makara-dhvaja. The charming brows of the Supreme Personality of Godhead protect the sages and devotees from being charmed by material lust and sex attraction. Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a great \u0101c\u0101rya, said that ever since he had seen the charming pastimes of the Lord, the charms of sex life had become abominable for him, and the mere thought of sex enjoyment would cause him to spit and turn his face. Thus if anyone wants to be aloof from sex attraction, he must see the charming smile and fascinating eyebrows of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " It is recommended that the yog\u012b visualize the laughter of the Lord after studying His smile very carefully. These particular descriptions of meditation on the smile, laughter, face, lips and teeth all indicate conclusively that God is not impersonal. It is described herein that one should meditate on the laughter or smiling of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. There is no other activity that can completely cleanse the heart of the devotee. The exceptional beauty of the laughter of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is that when He smiles His small teeth, which resemble the buds of jasmine flowers, at once become reddish, reflecting His rosy lips. If the yog\u012b is able to place the beautiful face of the Lord in the core of his heart, he will be completely satisfied. In other words, when one is absorbed in seeing the beauty of the Lord within himself, the material attraction can no longer disturb him."

Gradually, even the mind, which he used as a means to attract the Lord, as one attracts a fish to a hook, withdraws from material activity.",
        "purport": " Here it is clearly mentioned that meditation, which is an action of the mind, is not the perfect stage of sam\u0101dhi, or absorption. In the beginning the mind is employed in attracting the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but in the higher stages there is no question of using the mind. A devotee becomes accustomed to serving the Supreme Lord by purification of his senses. In other words, the yoga principles of meditation are required as long as one is not situated in pure devotional service. The mind is used to purify the senses, but when the senses are purified by meditation, there is no need to sit in a particular place and try to meditate upon the form of the Lord. One becomes so habituated that he automatically engages in the personal service of the Lord. When the mind forcibly is engaged upon the form of the Lord, this is called nirb\u012bja-yoga, or lifeless yoga, for the yog\u012b does not automatically engage in the personal service of the Lord. But when he is constantly thinking of the Lord, that is called sab\u012bja-yoga, or living yoga. One has to be promoted to the platform of living yoga. One should engage in the service of the Lord twenty-four hours a day, as confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. The stage of prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita can be attained by developing complete love. When one\u2019s love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service is fully developed, one always sees the Lord, even without artificially meditating on His form. His vision is divine because he has no other engagement. At this stage of spiritual realization it is not necessary to engage the mind artificially. Since the meditation recommended in the lower stages is a means to come to the platform of devotional service, those already engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are above such meditation. This stage of perfection is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "translation": "When the mind is thus completely freed from all material contamination and detached from material objectives, it is just like the flame of a lamp. At that time the mind is actually dovetailed with that of the Supreme Lord and is experienced as one with Him because it is freed from the interactive flow of the material qualities.",
        "purport": " In the material world the activities of the mind are acceptance and rejection. As long as the mind is in material consciousness, it must be forcibly trained to accept meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when one is actually elevated to loving the Supreme Lord, the mind is automatically absorbed in thought of the Lord. In such a position a yog\u012b has no other thought than to serve the Lord. This dovetailing of the mind with the desires of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called nirv\u0101\u1e47a, or making the mind one with the Supreme Lord. The best example of nirv\u0101\u1e47a is cited in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. In the beginning the mind of Arjuna deviated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted Arjuna to fight, but Arjuna did not want to, so there was disagreement. But after hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna dovetailed his mind with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s desire. This is called oneness. This oneness, however, did not cause Arjuna and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to lose their individualities. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers cannot understand this. They think that oneness necessitates loss of individuality. Actually, however, we find in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that individuality is not lost. When the mind is completely purified in love of Godhead, the mind becomes the mind of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The mind at that time does not act separately, nor does it act without inspiration to fulfill the desire of the Lord. The individual liberated soul has no other activity. Pratiniv\u1e5btta-gu\u1e47a-prav\u0101ha\u1e25. In the conditioned state the mind is always engaged in activity impelled by the three modes of the material world, but in the transcendental stage, the material modes cannot disturb the mind of the devotee. The devotee has no other concern than to satisfy the desires of the Lord. That is the highest stage of perfection, called nirv\u0101\u1e47a or nirv\u0101\u1e47a-mukti. At this stage the mind becomes completely free from material desire. Yath\u0101rci\u1e25. Arci\u1e25 means \u201cflame.\u201d When a lamp is broken or the oil is finished, we see that the flame of the lamp goes out. But according to scientific understanding, the flame is not extinguished; it is conserved. This is conservation of energy. Similarly, when the mind stops functioning on the material platform, it is conserved in the activities of the Supreme Lord. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers\u2019 conception of cessation of the functions of the mind is explained here: cessation of the mental functions means cessation of activities conducted under the influence of the three modes of material nature."

Forgetfulness of that sweet relationship is called ignorance, and in ignorance one is impelled by the three material modes of nature to think himself the enjoyer. When the devotee\u2019s mind is purified and he understands that his mind has to be dovetailed with the desires of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has attained the perfectional, transcendental stage, which is beyond the perception of material distress and happiness. As long as one acts on his own account, he is subject to all the material perceptions of so-called happiness and distress. Actually there is no happiness.

The liberated devotee, being awake to his constitutional position and thus situated in sam\u0101dhi, the highest perfectional stage of yoga, does not accept the by-products of the material body as his own.

        "purport": " The following questions may be posed. As long as the liberated soul is in contact with the body, why don\u2019t the bodily activities affect him? Doesn\u2019t he actually become contaminated by the action and reaction of material activities? In answer to such questions, this verse explains that the material body of a liberated soul is taken charge of by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not acting due to the living force of the living entity; it is simply acting as a reaction to past activities. Even after being switched off, an electric fan moves for some time. That movement is not due to the electric current, but is a continuation of the last movement; similarly, although a liberated soul appears to be acting just like an ordinary man, his actions are to be accepted as the continuation of past activities. In a dream one may see himself expanded through many bodies, but when awake he can understand that those bodies were all false. Similarly, although a liberated soul has the by-products of the body \u2014 children, wife, house, etc. \u2014 he does not identify himself with those bodily expansions. He knows that they are all products of the material dream. The gross body is made of the gross elements of matter, and the subtle body is made of mind, intelligence, ego and contaminated consciousness. If one can accept the subtle body of a dream as false and not identify oneself with that body, then certainly an awake person need not identify with the gross body. As one who is awake has no connection with the activities of the body in a dream, an awakened, liberated soul has no connection with the activities of the present body. In other words, because he is acquainted with his constitutional position, he never accepts the bodily concept of life."

The living entity is different from the material elements, and the supreme living entity, the Personality of Godhead, who is the creator of the material elements, is also different from the individual living entity. This philosophy is propounded by Lord Caitanya as acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva. Everything is simultaneously one with and different from everything else. The cosmic manifestation created by the Supreme Lord by His material energy is also simultaneously different and nondifferent from Him. The material energy is nondifferent from the Supreme Lord, but at the same time, because that energy is acting in a different way, it is different from Him. Similarly, the individual living entity is one with and different from the Supreme Lord. This \u201csimultaneously one and different\u201d philosophy is the perfect conclusion of the Bh\u0101gavata school, as confirmed here by Kapiladeva. Living entities are compared to the sparks of a fire. As stated in the previous verse, fire, flame, smoke and firewood are combined together. Here the living entity, the material elements and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are combined together. The exact position of the living entities is just like that of the sparks of a fire; they are part and parcel. The material energy is compared to the smoke. The fire is also part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said that whatever we can see or experience, either in the material or spiritual world, is an expansion of the different energies of the Supreme Lord. As fire distributes its light and heat from one place, the Supreme Personality of Godhead distributes His different energies all over His creation. The four principles of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophic doctrine are \u015buddha-advaita (purified oneness), dvaita-advaita (simultaneous oneness and difference), vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da-advaita and dvaita. All four principles of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy are based on the thesis of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam explained in these two verses."

Less intelligent men think that plants and grass grow out of the earth automatically, but one who is actually intelligent and has realized the self can see that this growth is not automatic; the cause is the soul, and the forms come out in material bodies under different conditions. By fermentation in the laboratory many germs are born, but this is due to the presence of the soul. The material scientist thinks that eggs are lifeless, but that is not a fact. From Vedic scripture we can understand that living entities in different forms are generated under different conditions. Birds evolve from eggs, and beasts and human beings are born from the embryo. The perfect vision of the yog\u012b or devotee is that he sees the presence of the living entity everywhere."

        "purport": " It is to be understood that the body is designated. Prak\u1e5bti is an interaction by the three modes of material nature, and according to these modes, someone has a small body and someone has a very large body. For example, the fire in a big piece of wood appears very big, and in a stick the fire appears small. Actually, the quality of fire is the same everywhere, but the manifestation of material nature is such that according to the fuel, the fire appears bigger and smaller. Similarly, the soul in the universal body, although of the same quality, is different from the soul in the smaller body. The small particles of soul are just like sparks of the larger soul. The greatest soul is the Supersoul, but the Supersoul is quantitatively different from the small soul. The Supersoul is described in the Vedic literature as the supplier of all necessities of the smaller soul (nityo nity\u0101n\u0101m). One who understands this distinction between the Supersoul and the individual soul is above lamentation and is in a peaceful position. When the smaller soul thinks himself quantitatively as big as the larger soul, he is under the spell of m\u0101y\u0101, for that is not his constitutional position. No one can become the greater soul simply by mental speculation. The smallness or greatness of different souls is described in the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a as sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba. The sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba soul is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba souls, or small particles, are eternally small particles, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25). The small living entities are eternally part and parcel, and therefore it is not possible for them to be quantitatively as great as the Supersoul."

        "translation": "Thus the yog\u012b can be in the self-realized position after conquering the insurmountable spell of m\u0101y\u0101, who presents herself as both the cause and effect of this material manifestation and is therefore very difficult to understand.",
        "purport": " It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the spell of m\u0101y\u0101, which covers the knowledge of the living entity, is insurmountable. However, one who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can conquer this seemingly insurmountable spell of m\u0101y\u0101. Here also it is stated that the daiv\u012b prak\u1e5bti, or the external energy of the Supreme Lord, is durvibh\u0101vy\u0101, very difficult to understand and very difficult to conquer. One must, however, conquer this insurmountable spell of m\u0101y\u0101, and this is possible, by the grace of the Lord, when God reveals Himself to the surrendered soul. It is also stated here, svar\u016bpe\u1e47\u0101vati\u1e63\u1e6dhate. Svar\u016bpa means that one has to know that he is not the Supreme Soul, but rather, part and parcel of the Supreme Soul; that is self-realization. To think falsely that one is the Supreme Soul and that one is all-pervading is not svar\u016bpa. This is not realization of his actual position. The real position is that one is part and parcel. It is recommended here that one remain in that position of actual self-realization. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this understanding is defined as Brahman realization. After Brahman realization, one can engage in the activities of Brahman. As long as one is not self-realized, he engages in activities based on false identification with the body. When one is situated in his real self, then the activities of Brahman realization begin. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers say that after Brahman realization, all activities stop, but that is not actually so. If the soul is so active in its abnormal condition, existing under the covering of matter, how can one deny its activity when free? An example may be cited here. If a man in a diseased condition is very active, how can one imagine that when he is free from the disease he will be inactive? Naturally the conclusion is that when one is free from all disease his activities are pure. It may be said that the activities of Brahman realization are different from those of conditional life, but that does not stop activity. This is indicated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): after one realizes oneself to be Brahman, devotional service begins. Mad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m: after Brahman realization, one can engage in the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore devotional service of the Lord is activity in Brahman realization. For those who engage in devotional service there is no spell of m\u0101y\u0101, and their situation is all-perfect. The duty of the living entity, as a part and parcel of the whole, is to render devotional service to the whole. That is the ultimate perfection of life."
