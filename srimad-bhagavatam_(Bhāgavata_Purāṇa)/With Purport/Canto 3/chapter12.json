        "purport": " Before the factual creation of the living entities in different varieties of species, the conditions under which a living being in the material world has to live were created by Brahm\u0101. Unless a living entity forgets his real identity, it is impossible for him to live in the material conditions of life. Therefore the first condition of material existence is forgetfulness of one\u2019s real identity. And by forgetting one\u2019s real identity, one is sure to be afraid of death, although a pure living soul is deathless and birthless. This false identification with material nature is the cause of false ownership of things which are offered by the arrangement of superior control. All material resources are offered to the living entity for his peaceful living and for the discharge of the duties of self-realization in conditioned life. But due to false identification, the conditioned soul becomes entrapped by the sense of false ownership of the property of the Supreme Lord. It is evident from this verse that Brahm\u0101 himself is a creation of the Supreme Lord, and the five kinds of nescience which condition the living entities in material existence are creations of Brahm\u0101. It is simply ludicrous to think the living entity to be equal with the Supreme Being when one can understand that the conditioned souls are under the influence of Brahm\u0101\u2019s magic wand. Pata\u00f1jali also accepts that there are five kinds of nescience, as mentioned herein."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15) that He is present in everyone\u2019s heart and is helping everyone to either remember of forget. The question may be raised why the Lord, who is all-merciful, helps one to remember and another to forget. Actually, His mercy is not exhibited in partiality towards one and enmity towards another. The living entity, as part and parcel of the Lord, is partially independent because he partially possesses all the qualities of the Lord. Anyone who has some independence may sometimes misuse it due to ignorance. When the living entity prefers to misuse his independence and glide down towards nescience, the all-merciful Lord first of all tries to protect him from the trap, but when the living entity persists in gliding down to hell, the Lord helps him to forget his real position. The Lord helps the falling living entity glide down to the lowest point, just to give him the chance to see if he is happy by misusing his independence. Almost all the conditioned souls who are rotting in the material world are misusing their independence, and therefore five kinds of nescience are imposed upon them. As an obedient servitor of the Lord, Brahm\u0101 creates all these as a matter of necessity, but he is not happy in doing so because a devotee of the Lord naturally does not like to see anyone falling down from his real position. Persons who do not care for the path of realization get full facilities from the Lord for executing their proclivities to the fullest extent, and Brahm\u0101 helps in that procedure without fail."

Brahm\u0101 created the four great sages Sanaka, Sananda, San\u0101tana and Sanat to entrust them with these four principles of spiritual advancement, and they inaugurated their own spiritual party, or samprad\u0101ya, known as the Kum\u0101ra samprad\u0101ya, or later on as the Nimb\u0101rka samprad\u0101ya, for the advancement of bhakti.

        "purport": " The creation of Rudra from between the eyebrows of Brahm\u0101 as the result of his anger, generated from the mode of passion partly touched by ignorance, is very significant. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.37) the principle of Rudra is described. Krodha (anger) is the product of k\u0101ma (lust), which is the result of the mode of passion. When lust and hankering are unsatisfied, the element of krodha appears, which is the formidable enemy of the conditioned soul. This most sinful and inimical passion is represented as aha\u1e45k\u0101ra, or the false egocentric attitude of thinking oneself to be all in all. Such an egocentric attitude on the part of the conditioned soul, who is completely under the control of material nature, is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as foolish. The egocentric attitude is a manifestation of the Rudra principle in the heart, wherein krodha (anger) is generated. This anger develops in the heart and is further manifested through various senses, like the eyes, hands and legs. When a man is angry he expresses such anger with red-hot eyes and sometimes makes a display of clenching his fists or kicking his legs. This exhibition of the Rudra principle is the proof of Rudra\u2019s presence in such places. When a man is angry he breathes very rapidly, and thus Rudra is represented in the air of life, or in the activities of breathing. When the sky is overcast with dense clouds and roars in anger, and when the wind blows very fiercely, the Rudra principle is manifested, and so also when the sea water is infuriated by the wind it appears in a gloomy feature of Rudra, which is very fearful to the common man. When fire is ablaze we can also experience the presence of Rudra, and when there is an inundation over the earth we can understand that this is also the representation of Rudra. There are many earthly creatures who constantly represent the Rudra element. The snake, tiger and lion are always representations of Rudra. Sometimes, because of the extreme heat of the sun, there are cases of heatstroke, and due to the extreme coldness created by the moon there are cases of collapse. There are many sages empowered with the influence of austerity and many yog\u012bs, philosophers and renouncers who sometimes exhibit their acquired power under the influence of the Rudra principle of anger and passion. The great yog\u012b Durv\u0101s\u0101, under the influence of this Rudra principle, picked a quarrel with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, and a br\u0101hma\u1e47a boy exhibited the Rudra principle by cursing the great King Par\u012bk\u1e63it. When the Rudra principle is exhibited by persons who are not engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the angry person falls down from the peak of his improved position. This is confirmed as follows: The most lamentable falldown of the impersonalist is due to his false and unreasonable claim of being one with the Supreme."

In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the last instruction is to give up all other engagements in the name of religion and take shelter of the Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also confirms that the highest perfection of religion is that which leads to the devotional service of the Lord, unmotivated and unhampered by material impediments. Religion in its perfect form is the devotional service of the Lord, and irreligion is just the opposite. The heart is the most important part of the body, whereas the back is the most neglected part. When one is attacked by an enemy one is apt to endure attacks from the back and protect himself carefully from all attacks on the chest.

        "purport": " A conditioned soul is under the influence of mental speculation. However great one may be in the estimation of mundane education and learning, he cannot be free from the influence of psychic activities. Therefore it is very difficult to give up lust and the desires for low activities until one is in the line of devotional service to the Lord. When one is frustrated in lust and low desires, anger is generated from the mind and expressed from between the eyebrows. Ordinary men are therefore advised to concentrate the mind by focusing on the place between the eyebrows, whereas the devotees of the Lord are already practiced to place the Supreme Personality of Godhead on the seat of their minds. The theory of becoming desireless is untenable because the mind cannot be made desireless. When it is recommended that one be desireless, it is understood that one should not desire things which are destructive to spiritual values. A devotee of the Lord always has the Lord in his mind, and thus he does not need to be desireless because all his desires are in relationship with the service of the Lord. The power of speaking is called Sarasvat\u012b, or the goddess of learning, and the birthplace of the goddess of learning is the mouth of Brahm\u0101. Even if a man is endowed with the favor of the goddess of learning, it is quite possible for his heart to be full of lust and material desire and his eyebrows to display symptoms of anger. One may be very learned in the mundane estimation, but that does not mean that he is free from all low activities of lust and anger. Good qualifications can be expected only from a pure devotee, who is always engaged in the thought of the Lord, or in sam\u0101dhi, with faith."

        "purport": " Balav\u0101n indriya-gr\u0101mo vidv\u0101\u1e41sam api kar\u1e63ati (Bh\u0101g. 9.19.17). It is said that the senses are so mad and strong that they can bewilder even the most sensible and learned man. Therefore it is advised that one should not indulge in living alone even with one\u2019s mother, sister or daughter. Vidv\u0101\u1e41sam api kar\u1e63ati means that even the most learned also become victims of the sensuous urge. Maitreya hesitated to state this anomaly on the part of Brahm\u0101, who was sexually inclined to his own daughter, but still he mentioned it because sometimes it so happens, and the living example is Brahm\u0101 himself, although he is the primeval living being and the most learned within the whole universe. If Brahm\u0101 could be a victim of the sexual urge, then what of others, who are prone to so many mundane frailties? This extraordinary immorality on the part of Brahm\u0101 was heard to have occurred in some particular kalpa, but it could not have happened in the kalpa in which Brahm\u0101 heard directly from the Lord the four essential verses of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam because the Lord blessed Brahm\u0101, after giving him lessons on the Bh\u0101gavatam, that he would never be bewildered in any kalpa whatsoever. This indicates that before the hearing of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam he might have fallen a victim to such sensuality, but after hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam directly from the Lord, there was no possibility of such failures. One should, however, take serious note of this incident. The human being is a social animal, and his unrestricted mixing with the fair sex leads to downfall. Such social freedom of man and woman, especially among the younger section, is certainly a great stumbling block on the path of spiritual progress. Material bondage is due only to sexual bondage, and therefore unrestricted association of man and woman is surely a great impediment. Maitreya cited this example on the part of Brahm\u0101 just to bring to our notice this great danger."

Brahm\u0101 has a fabulous duration of life, but he was obliged to give up his body due to his grievous sin, even though he had merely contemplated it in his mind without having actually done it. This is a lesson for the living entities, showing how sinful an act it is to indulge in unrestricted sex life. Even to think of abominable sex life is sinful, and to compensate for such acts, one has to give up his body. In other words, one\u2019s duration of life, blessings, opulence, etc., are decreased by sinful acts, and the most dangerous type of sinful act is unrestricted sex. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, or sinful life is the cause of gross ignorance. The feature of ignorance is darkness or fog. Darkness or fog still covers the whole universe, and the sun is the only counteracting principle. One who takes shelter of the Lord, the perpetual light, has no fear of being annihilated in the darkness of fog or ignorance."

The Vedas are the source of all knowledge, and they were first revealed to Brahm\u0101 by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead while Brahm\u0101 was thinking of re-creating the material world. Brahm\u0101 is powerful by dint of his devotional service unto the Lord, and the Lord is always ready to forgive His devotee if by chance he falls down from the noble path of devotional service. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.42) confirms this as follows: \u201cAny person who is engaged one hundred percent in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, at His lotus feet, is very dear to the Personality of Godhead Hari, and the Lord, being situated in the heart of the devotee, excuses all kinds of sins committed by chance.\u201d It was never expected that a great personality like Brahm\u0101 would ever think of sex indulgence with his daughter. The example shown by Brahm\u0101 only suggests that the power of material nature is so strong that it can act upon everyone, even Brahm\u0101. Brahm\u0101 was saved by the mercy of the Lord with a little punishment, but by the grace of the Lord he did not lose his prestige as the great Brahm\u0101."

The vowels are a, \u0101, i, \u012b, u, \u016b, \u1e5b, \u1e5d, \u1e37, e, ai, o, au, and the consonants are ka, kha, ga, gha, etc. Amongst the consonants, the first twenty-five letters are called the spar\u015bas. There are also four anta\u1e25-sthas. Of the \u016b\u1e63mas there are three s\u2019s, called t\u0101lavya, m\u016brdhanya and dantya. The musical notes are \u1e63a, \u1e5b, g\u0101, ma, dha, and ni. All these sound vibrations are originally called \u015babda-brahma, or spiritual sound. It is said, therefore, that Brahm\u0101 was created in the Mah\u0101-kalpa as the incarnation of spiritual sound. The Vedas are spiritual sound, and therefore there is no need of material interpretation for the sound vibration of the Vedic literature. The Vedas should be vibrated as they are, although they are symbolically represented with letters which are known to us materially. In the ultimate issue there is nothing material because everything has its origin in the spiritual world. The material manifestation is therefore called illusion in the proper sense of the term. For those who are realized souls there is nothing but spirit."
