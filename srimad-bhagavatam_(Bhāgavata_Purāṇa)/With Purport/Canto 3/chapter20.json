As a devotee, Vidura showed by example that anywhere that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not honored is a place unfit for human habitation. A devotee may be tolerant regarding his own interests, but he should not be tolerant when there is misbehavior toward the Lord or the Lord\u2019s devotee.

        "purport": " Here the words viraj\u0101s t\u012brtha-sevay\u0101 refer to Vidura, who was completely cleansed of all contamination by traveling to places of pilgrimage. In India there are hundreds of sacred places of pilgrimage, of which Pray\u0101ga, Hardwar, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and R\u0101me\u015bvaram are considered principal. After leaving his home, which was full of politics and diplomacy, Vidura wanted to purify himself by traveling to all the sacred places, which are so situated that anyone who goes there automatically becomes purified. This is especially true in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana; any person may go there, and even if he is sinful he will at once contact an atmosphere of spiritual life and will automatically chant the names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and R\u0101dh\u0101. That we have actually seen and experienced. It is recommended in the \u015b\u0101stras that after retiring from active life and accepting the v\u0101naprastha (retired) order, one should travel everywhere to places of pilgrimage in order to purify himself. Vidura completely discharged this duty, and at last he reached Ku\u015b\u0101varta, or Hardwar, where the sage Maitreya was sitting. Another significant point is that one must go to sacred places not only to take bath there but to search out great sages like Maitreya and take instructions from them. If one does not do so, his traveling to places of pilgrimage is simply a waste of time. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a great \u0101c\u0101rya of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sect, has, for the present, forbidden us to go to such places of pilgrimage because in this age, the times having so changed, a sincere person may have a different impression on seeing the behavior of the present residents of the pilgrimage sites. He has recommended that instead of taking the trouble to travel to such places, one should concentrate his mind on Govinda, and that will help him. Of course, to concentrate one\u2019s mind on Govinda in any place is a path meant for those who are the most spiritually advanced; it is not for ordinary persons. Ordinary persons may still derive benefit from traveling to holy places like Pray\u0101ga, Mathur\u0101, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and Hardwar. It is recommended in this verse that one find a person who knows the science of God, or a tattva-vit. Tattva-vit means \u201cone who knows the Absolute Truth.\u201d There are many pseudotranscendentalists, even at places of pilgrimage. Such men are always present, and one has to be intelligent enough to find the actual person to be consulted; then one\u2019s attempt to progress by traveling to different holy places will be successful. One has to be freed from all contamination, and at the same time he has to find a person who knows the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a helps a sincere person; as stated in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de: by the mercy of the spiritual master and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one attains the path of salvation, devotional service. If one sincerely searches for spiritual salvation, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being situated in everyone\u2019s heart, gives him the intelligence to find a suitable spiritual master. By the grace of a spiritual master like Maitreya, one gets the proper instruction and advances in his spiritual life."

Vidura then spoke to the sage as follows.",
        "purport": " It is stated here that the Lord assumed the form of a boar by His own potency. His form is not actually the form of a conditioned soul. A conditioned soul is forced to accept a particular type of body by the higher authority of material laws, but here it is clearly said that the Lord was not forced to accept the form of a boar by the external power. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the same fact is confirmed: when the Lord descends to this earth, He assumes a form by His own internal potency. The form of the Lord, therefore, can never consist of material energy. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da version that when Brahman assumes a form the form is accepted from m\u0101y\u0101 is not acceptable, because although m\u0101y\u0101 is superior to the conditioned soul, she is not superior to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; she is under the control of the Supreme Godhead, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. M\u0101y\u0101 is under His superintendence; m\u0101y\u0101 cannot overcome the Lord. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da idea that the living entity is the Supreme Absolute Truth but has become covered by m\u0101y\u0101 is invalid, because m\u0101y\u0101 cannot be so great that it can cover the Supreme. The covering capacity can be employed on the part and parcel of Brahman, not on the Supreme Brahman."

        "translation": "Maitreya said: When the equilibrium of the combination of the three modes of nature was agitated by the unseen activity of the living entity, by Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and by the force of time, the total material elements were produced.",
        "purport": " The cause of the material creation is described here very lucidly. The first cause is daiva, or the destiny of the conditioned soul. The material creation exists for the conditioned soul who wanted to become a false lord for sense enjoyment. One cannot trace out the history of when the conditioned soul first desired to lord it over material nature, but in Vedic literature we always find that the material creation is meant for the sense enjoyment of the conditioned soul. There is a nice verse which says that the sum and substance of the conditioned soul\u2019s sense enjoyment is that as soon as he forgets his primary duty, to render service to the Lord, he creates an atmosphere of sense enjoyment, which is called m\u0101y\u0101; that is the cause of material creation. Another word used here is durvitarkye\u1e47a. No one can argue about when and how the conditioned soul became desirous of sense enjoyment, but the cause is there. Material nature is an atmosphere meant only for the sense enjoyment of the conditioned soul, and it is created by the Personality of Godhead. It is mentioned here that in the beginning of the creation the material nature, or prak\u1e5bti, is agitated by the Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. There are three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us mentioned. One is Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, another is Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and the third is K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam discusses all these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us, and here also it is confirmed that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the cause of creation. From Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also we learn that prak\u1e5bti begins to work and is still working under K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s, glance of superintendence, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unchangeable. One should not mistakenly think that because the creation emanates from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He has therefore transformed into this material cosmic manifestation. He exists in His personal form always, but the cosmic manifestation takes place by His inconceivable potency. The workings of that energy are difficult to comprehend, but it is understood from Vedic literature that the conditioned soul creates his own destiny and is offered a particular body by the laws of nature under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who always accompanies him as Param\u0101tm\u0101."

The third group is the five sense organs for acquiring knowledge: eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. The fourth group is the five working senses: speech, hands, feet, anus and genitals. Some say that there are five groups of five. One group is the sense objects, one is the five elements, one is the five sense organs for acquiring knowledge, another is the senses for working, and the fifth group is the five deities who control these divisions."

The other half of the universe remains vacant, and that vacant region is called outer space. Then the lotus flower sprouts from His abdomen and produces the first living creature, Brahm\u0101.

This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Fifteenth Chapter. The Lord says, \u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and by Me are remembrance and forgetfulness made possible.\u201d As the witness of the activities of the individual entities, the Lord gives each one remembrance and intelligence to act according to his desire at the time he was annihilated in his last birth in the last millennium. This intelligence is invoked according to one\u2019s own capacity, or by the law of karma. Brahm\u0101 was the first living entity, and he was empowered by the Supreme Lord to act in charge of the mode of passion; therefore, he was given the required intelligence, which is so powerful and extensive that he is almost independent of the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as a highly posted manager is almost as independent as the owner of a firm, Brahm\u0101 is described here as independent because, as the Lord\u2019s representative to control the universe, he is almost as powerful and independent as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord, as the Supersoul within Brahm\u0101, gave him the intelligence to create. Therefore the creative power of every living entity is not his own; it is by the grace of the Lord that one can create. There are many scientists and great workers in this material world who have wonderful creative force, but they act and create only according to the direction of the Supreme Lord. A scientist may create many wonderful inventions by the direction of the Lord, but it is not possible for him to overcome the stringent laws of material nature by his intelligence, nor is it possible to acquire such intelligence from the Lord, for the Lord\u2019s supremacy would then be hampered. It is stated in this verse that Brahm\u0101 created the universe as it was before. This means that he created everything by the same name and form as in the previous cosmic manifestation."

        "purport": " The conditioned souls, or living entities who come to the material world to enjoy sense gratification, are covered in the beginning by five different conditions. The first condition is a covering of t\u0101misra, or anger. Constitutionally, each and every living entity has minute independence; it is misuse of that minute independence for the conditioned soul to think that he can also enjoy like the Supreme Lord or to think, \u201cWhy shall I not be a free enjoyer like the Supreme Lord?\u201d This forgetfulness of his constitutional position is due to anger or envy. The living entity, being eternally a part-and-parcel servitor of the Supreme Lord, can never, by constitution, be an equal enjoyer with the Lord. When he forgets this, however, and tries to be one with Him, his condition is called t\u0101misra. Even in the field of spiritual realization, this t\u0101misra mentality of the living entity is hard to overcome. In trying to get out of the entanglement of material life, there are many who want to be one with the Supreme. Even in their transcendental activities, this lower-grade mentality of t\u0101misra continues. Andha-t\u0101misra involves considering death to be the ultimate end. The atheists generally think that the body is the self and that everything is therefore ended with the end of the body. Thus they want to enjoy material life as far as possible during the existence of the body. Their theory is: \u201cAs long as you live, you should live prosperously. Never mind whether you commit all kinds of so-called sins. You must eat sumptuously. Beg, borrow and steal, and if you think that by stealing and borrowing you are being entangled in sinful activities for which you will have to pay, then just forget that misconception because after death everything is finished. No one is responsible for anything he does during his life.\u201d This atheistic conception of life is killing human civilization, for it is without knowledge of the continuation of eternal life. This andha-t\u0101misra ignorance is due to tamas. The condition of not knowing anything about the spirit soul is called tamas. This material world is also generally called tamas because ninety-nine percent of its living entities are ignorant of their identity as soul. Almost everyone is thinking that he is this body; he has no information of the spirit soul. Guided by this misconception, one always thinks, \u201cThis is my body, and anything in relationship with this body is mine.\u201d For such misguided living entities, sex life is the background of material existence. Actually, the conditioned souls, in ignorance in this material world, are simply guided by sex life, and as soon as they get the opportunity for sex life, they become attached to so-called home, motherland, children, wealth and opulence. As these attachments increase, moha, or the illusion of the bodily concept of life, also increases. Thus the idea that \u201cI am this body, and everything belonging to this body is mine\u201d also increases, and as the whole world is put into moha, sectarian societies, families and nationalities are created, and they fight with one another. Mah\u0101-moha means to be mad after material enjoyment. Especially in this Age of Kali, everyone is overwhelmed by the madness to accumulate paraphernalia for material enjoyment. These definitions are very nicely given in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, wherein it is said:"

        "purport": " Here the words bhakt\u0101n\u0101m anur\u016bp\u0101tma-dar\u015banam mean that the Personality of Godhead manifests His multiforms according to the desires of the devotees. For example, Hanum\u0101nj\u012b (Vajr\u0101\u1e45gaj\u012b) wanted to see the form of the Lord as the Personality of Godhead R\u0101macandra, whereas other Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas want to see the form of R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and still other devotees want to see the Lord in the form of Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers think that although all these forms are assumed by the Lord just as the devotees desire to see Him, actually He is impersonal. From Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, however, we can understand that this is not so, for the Lord has multiforms. It is said in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, advaitam acyutam. The Lord does not appear before the devotee because of the devotee\u2019s imagination. Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 further explains that the Lord has innumerable forms: r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan. He exists in millions and millions of forms. There are 8,400,000 spieces of living entities, but the incarnations of the Supreme Lord are innumerable. In the Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that as the waves in the sea cannot be counted but appear and disappear continually, the incarnations and forms of the Lord are innumerable. A devotee is attached to a particular form, and it is that form which he worships. We have just described the first appearance of the boar within this universe. There are innumerable universes, and somewhere or other the boar form is now existing. All the forms of the Lord are eternal. It is the devotee\u2019s inclination to worship a particular form, and he engages in devotional service to that form. In a verse in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, Hanum\u0101n, the great devotee of R\u0101ma, said, \u201cI know that there is no difference between the S\u012bt\u0101-R\u0101ma and Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but nevertheless, the form of R\u0101ma and S\u012bt\u0101 has absorbed my affection and love. Therefore I want to see the Lord in the forms of R\u0101ma and S\u012bt\u0101.\u201d Similarly, the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava loves the forms of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Rukmi\u1e47\u012b at Dv\u0101rak\u0101. The words bhakt\u0101n\u0101m anur\u016bp\u0101tma-dar\u015banam mean that the Lord is always pleased to favor the devotee in the particular form in which the devotee wants to worship and render service unto Him. In this verse it is stated that Brahm\u0101 approached Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This form of the Lord is K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Whenever there is some trouble and Brahm\u0101 has to approach the Lord, he can approach K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and it is the grace of the Lord that whenever Brahm\u0101 approaches about disturbances in the universe, the Lord gives him relief in so many ways."

        "purport": " The Lord is described here by the word vivikt\u0101dhy\u0101tma-dar\u015bana\u1e25. If anyone can completely perceive another\u2019s distress without doubt, it is the Lord Himself. If someone is in distress and wants to get relief from his friend, sometimes it so happens that his friend does not appreciate the volume of distress he is suffering. But for the Supreme Lord it is not difficult. The Supreme Lord, as Param\u0101tm\u0101, is sitting within the heart of every living entity, and He directly perceives the exact causes of distress. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25: \u201cI am sitting in everyone\u2019s heart, and because of Me one\u2019s remembrance and forgetfulness occur.\u201d Thus whenever one fully surrenders unto the Supreme Lord, one finds that He is sitting within one\u2019s heart. He can give us direction how to get out of dangers or how to approach Him in devotional service. The Lord, however, asked Brahm\u0101 to give up his present body because it had created the demoniac principle. According to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, Brahm\u0101\u2019s constant dropping of his body does not refer to his actually giving up his body. Rather, he suggests that Brahm\u0101 gave up a particular mentality. Mind is the subtle body of the living entity. We may sometimes be absorbed in some thought which is sinful, but if we give up the sinful thought, it may be said that we give up the body. Brahm\u0101\u2019s mind was not in correct order when he created the demons. It must have been full of passion because the entire creation was passionate; therefore such passionate sons were born. It follows that any father and mother should also be careful while begetting children. The mental condition of a child depends upon the mental status of his parents at the time he is conceived. According to the Vedic system, therefore, the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, or the ceremony for giving birth to a child, is observed. Before begetting a child, one has to sanctify his perplexed mind. When the parents engage their minds in the lotus feet of the Lord and in such a state the child is born, naturally good devotee children come; when the society is full of such good population, there is no trouble from demoniac mentalities."

The asuras, who are passionate by nature, dominated as they are by the element of rajas, took it for a damsel, whose lotus feet resounded with the tinkling of anklets, whose eyes were wide with intoxication and whose hips were covered by fine cloth, over which shone a girdle.",
        "purport": " As early morning is the period for spiritual cultivation, the beginning of evening is the period for passion. Demoniac men are generally very fond of sex enjoyment; therefore they very much appreciate the approach of evening. The demons took the approach of the evening twilight to be a beautiful woman, and they began to adore her in various ways. They imagined the twilight to be a very beautiful woman with tinkling bangles on her feet, a girdle on her hips, and beautiful breasts, and for their sexual satisfaction they imagined the appearance of this beautiful girl before them."

Sometimes the demoniac arrange for so-called sports, like tennis, with the opposite sex. The purpose of such sporting is to see the bodily construction of the beautiful girl and enjoy a subtle sex mentality. This demoniac sex mentality of material enjoyment is sometimes encouraged by so-called yog\u012bs who encourage the public to enjoy sex life in different varieties and at the same time advertise that if one meditates on a certain manufactured mantra one can become God within six months. The public wants to be cheated, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore creates such cheaters to misrepresent and delude. These so-called yog\u012bs are actually enjoyers of the world garbed as yog\u012bs. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, however, recommends that if one wants to enjoy life, then it cannot be with these gross senses. A patient is advised by the experienced physician to refrain from ordinary enjoyment while in the diseased condition. A diseased person cannot enjoy anything; he has to restrain his enjoyment in order to get rid of the disease. Similarly, our material condition is a diseased condition. If one wants to enjoy real sense enjoyment, then one must get free of the entanglement of material existence. In spiritual life we can enjoy sense enjoyment which has no end. The difference between material and spiritual enjoyment is that material enjoyment is limited. Even if a man engages in material sex enjoyment, he cannot enjoy it for long. But when the sex enjoyment is given up, then one can enter spiritual life, which is unending. In the Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.1) it is stated that brahma-saukhya, spiritual happiness, is ananta, unending. Foolish creatures are enamored by the beauty of matter and think that the enjoyment it offers is real, but actually that is not real enjoyment."

As moths at night surround a fire and are killed, so the demons become victims of the movements of the ball-like breasts of a beautiful woman. The scattered hair of a beautiful woman also afflicts the heart of a lusty demon."

Here it is clearly stated that when a man is fast asleep and saliva flows from his mouth and he remains unclean, ghosts then take advantage of his unclean state and haunt his body.

It is through the medium of this invisible body that those well versed in the rituals offer oblations to the S\u0101dhyas and Pit\u0101s [in the form of their departed ancestors] on the occasion of \u015br\u0101ddha.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u0101ddha is a ritualistic performance observed by the followers of the Vedas. There is a yearly occasion of fifteen days when ritualistic religionists follow the principle of offering oblations to departed souls. Thus those fathers and ancestors who, by freaks of nature, might not have a gross body for material enjoyment can again gain such bodies due to the offering of \u015br\u0101ddha oblations by their descendants. The performance of \u015br\u0101ddha, or offering oblations with pras\u0101da, is still current in India, especially at Gay\u0101, where oblations are offered at the lotus feet of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in a celebrated temple. Because the Lord is thus pleased with the devotional service of the descendants, by His grace He liberates the condemned souls of forefathers who do not have gross bodies, and He favors them to again receive a gross body for development of spiritual advancement. Unfortunately, by the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, the conditioned soul employs the body he gets for sense gratification, forgetting that such an occupation may lead him to return to an invisible body. The devotee of the Lord, or one who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, does not need to perform such ritualistic ceremonies as \u015br\u0101ddha because he is always pleasing the Supreme Lord; therefore his fathers and ancestors who might have been in difficulty are automatically relieved. The vivid example is Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja requested Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva to deliver his sinful father, who had so many times offended the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord replied that in a family where a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava like Prahl\u0101da is born, not only his father but his father\u2019s father and their fathers \u2014 up to the fourteenth father back \u2014 are all automatically delivered. The conclusion, therefore, is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the sum total of all good work for the family, for society and for all living entities. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, the author says that a person fully conversant with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not perform any rituals because he knows that simply by serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all rituals are automatically performed."
