Nothing exists without Him, and therefore everything, however wonderful it may appear to our meager knowledge, is but the work of the magical wand of the Supreme Lord. As far as time is concerned, we beg to subjoin herewith a table of timings in terms of the modern clock.

A human being is expected to live up to one hundred years. That is the way of the controlling measure of eternal time. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.52) affirms this control in this way: \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, under whose control even the sun, which is considered to be the eye of the Lord, rotates within the fixed orbit of eternal time. The sun is the king of all planetary systems and has unlimited potency in heat and light.\u201d"

Animals, of course, have no sense of responsibility, but even humans, who have developed a sense of responsibility, while away their valuable time without engaging in devotional service to the Lord; they live merrily, unafraid of impending death. This is the madness of human society. The madman has no responsibility in life. Similarly, a human being who does not develop a sense of responsibility before he dies is no better than the madman who tries to enjoy material life very happily without concern for the future.

        "purport": " The great sage Maitreya has given a considerable description of the time of different dimensions, beginning from the atom up to the duration of the life of Brahm\u0101. Now he attempts to give some idea of the time of the unlimited Personality of Godhead. He just gives a hint of His unlimited time by the standard of the life of Brahm\u0101. The entire duration of the life of Brahm\u0101 is calculated to be less than a second of the Lord\u2019s time, and it is explained in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.48) as follows: \u201cI worship Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, whose plenary portion is Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. All the heads of the innumerable universes [the Brahm\u0101s] live only by taking shelter of the time occupied by one of His breaths.\u201d The impersonalists do not believe in the form of the Lord, and thus they would hardly believe in the Lord\u2019s sleeping. Their idea is obtained by a poor fund of knowledge; they calculate everything in terms of man\u2019s capacity. They think that the existence of the Supreme is just the opposite of active human existence: because the human being has senses, the Supreme must be without sense perception; because the human being has a form, the Supreme must be formless; and because the human being sleeps, the Supreme must not sleep. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, however, does not agree with such impersonalists. It is clearly stated herein that the Supreme Lord rests in yoga-nidr\u0101, as previously discussed. And because He sleeps, naturally He must breathe, and the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 confirms that within His breathing period innumerable Brahm\u0101s take birth and die. There is complete agreement between \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Eternal time is never lost along with the life of Brahm\u0101. It continues, but it has no ability to control the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the Lord is the controller of time. In the spiritual world there is undoubtedly time, but it has no control over activities. Time is unlimited, and the spiritual world is also unlimited, since everything there exists on the absolute plane."

The analytical studies of the material world are the subject matter of S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy. The first sixteen diversities are the eleven senses and five sense objects, and the eight elements are the gross and subtle matter, namely earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and ego. All these combined together are distributed throughout the entire universe, which extends diametrically to four billion miles. Besides this universe of our experience, there are innumerable other universes. Some of them are bigger than the present one, and all of them are clustered together under similar material elements as described below."
