The P\u016bru dynasty was full of devotees of the Personality of Godhead and was therefore glorious. Because they were not attached to impersonal Brahman or to the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 but were directly attached to Bhagav\u0101n, the Personality of Godhead, they were worthy to render service to the Lord and His pure devotees. Because Vidura was one of the descendants of that family, naturally he engaged in spreading wide the ever-new glories of the Lord. Maitreya felt happy to have such glorious company as Vidura. He considered the company of Vidura most desirable because such association can accelerate one\u2019s dormant propensities for devotional service."

Only one who is fortunate can have the opportunity to hear \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam in the association of pure devotees of the Lord. Under the spell of material energy, the living entities are entrapped in the bondage of many difficulties simply for the sake of a little bit of material happiness. They engage in fruitive activities, not knowing the implications. Under the false impression that the body is the self, the living entities foolishly relate to so many false attachments. They think that they can engage with materialistic paraphernalia forever. This gross misconception of life is so strong that a person suffers continually, life after life, under the external energy of the Lord. If one comes in contact with the book Bh\u0101gavatam as well as with the devotee bh\u0101gavata, who knows what the Bh\u0101gavatam is, then such a fortunate man gets out of the material entanglement. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Maitreya Muni, out of compassion for the suffering men in the world, proposes to speak on the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam first and last."

The sages came down from Satyaloka by taking advantage of the flowing water, a process of transportation made possible by the power of mystic yoga. If a river flows thousands and thousands of miles, a perfect yog\u012b can at once transport himself from one place to another simply by dipping in its water. The Ganges is the only celestial river which flows throughout the universe, and great sages travel all over the universe via this sacred river. The statement that their hair was wet indicates that it was directly moistened by the water originating from the lotus feet of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (the Ganges). Whoever touches the water of the Ganges to his head surely touches the lotus feet of the Lord directly and can become free from all effects of sinful acts. If after taking a bath in the Ganges or being washed of all sins, a man guards himself against committing further sinful acts, then certainly he is delivered. But if he again takes up sinful activities, his bath in the Ganges is as good as that of the elephant, who nicely takes his bath in a river but later spoils the whole thing by covering himself with dust on the land."

The great sage Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni arrived at the sacrifice and requested Par\u0101\u015bara to stop the deadly action, and because of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha\u2019s position and respect in the community of sages, Par\u0101\u015bara could not deny the request. Par\u0101\u015bara having stopped the sacrifice, Pulastya, the father of the demons, appreciated his brahminical temperament and gave the blessing that in the future he would be a great speaker on the Vedic literatures called the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, the supplements of the Vedas. Par\u0101\u015bara\u2019s action was appreciated by Pulastya because Par\u0101\u015bara had forgiven the demons out of his brahminical power of forgiveness. Par\u0101\u015bara was able to demolish all the demons in the sacrifice, but he considered, \u201cDemons are so made that they devour living creatures, men and animals, but why on that account should I withdraw my brahminical qualification of forgiveness?\u201d As the great speaker of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, Par\u0101\u015bara first of all spoke on the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a because it is the foremost of all the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. Maitreya Muni desired to narrate the same Bh\u0101gavatam be had heard from Par\u0101\u015bara, and Vidura was qualified to hear it because of his faithfulness and his following the instructions received from superiors. So \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was being narrated from time immemorial by the disciplic succession, even before the time of Vy\u0101sadeva. The so-called historians calculate the Pur\u0101\u1e47as to be only a few hundred years old, but factually the Pur\u0101\u1e47as existed from time immemorial, before all historical calculations by the mundaners and speculative philosophers."

Such foolish living entities are very enthusiastic to work for some temporary benefit within perpetual bondage. One thinks himself very clever throughout his life if he is able to leave behind him a great asset of wealth for his children, and to achieve this temporary benefit he takes the risk of all sinful activities, without knowledge that such activities will keep him perpetually bound by the shackles of material bondage. Due to this polluted mentality and due to material sins, the aggregate combination of living entities appeared to be bluish. Such an impetus of activity for fruitive result is made possible by the dictation of the external energy of the Lord, k\u0101la."

Brahm\u0101\u2019s one day is equal to one thousand times the aggregate of the four yugas (calculated to be 4,300,000 years). On that basis, Brahm\u0101 meditated for one hundred years before he could understand the supreme cause of all causes, and then he wrote the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, which is approved and recognized by Lord Caitanya and in which he sings, govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi.

Therefore, the Lord is the only desire of the pure devotees, and devotional service is the only spotless process for achieving His favor. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.1.11) that pure devotional service is j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam: pure devotional service is without any tinge of speculative knowledge and fruitive activities. Such devotional service is able to award the pure devotee the highest result, namely direct association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to the Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad, the Lord showed one of the many thousands of petals of His lotus feet. It is said: br\u0101hma\u1e47o \u2019s\u0101v anavarata\u1e41 me dhy\u0101ta\u1e25 stuta\u1e25 par\u0101rdh\u0101nte so\u00a0\u2019budhyata gopa-ve\u015bo me purast\u0101t \u0101virbabh\u016bva. After penetrating for millions of years, Lord Brahm\u0101 could understand the transcendental form of the Lord as \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the dress of a cowherd boy, and thus he recorded his experience in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 in the famous prayer govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi."

There are many transcendentalists in different fields of spiritual activities, but devotional service to the Lord is unique. Devotees do not ask anything from the Lord in exchange for their service. Even the most desirable liberation is refused by devotees, although offered by the Lord. Thus the Lord becomes a kind of debtor to the devotees, and He can only try to repay the devotees\u2019 service with His ever-enchanting smile. The devotees are ever satisfied by the smiling face of the Lord, and they become enlivened. And by seeing the devotees so enlivened, the Lord Himself is further satisfied. So there is continuous transcendental competition between the Lord and His devotees by such reciprocation of service and acknowledgement."
