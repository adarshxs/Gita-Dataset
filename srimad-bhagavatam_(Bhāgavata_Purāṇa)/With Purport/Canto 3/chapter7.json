        "translation": "\u015ar\u012b Vidura said: O great br\u0101hma\u1e47a, since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the complete spiritual whole and is unchangeable, how is He connected with the material modes of nature and their activities? If this is His pastime, how do the activities of the unchangeable take place and exhibit qualities without the modes of nature?",
        "purport": " As described in the previous chapter, the difference between the Supersoul, the Supreme Lord, and the living entities is that the activities of the Lord in creating the cosmic manifestation are performed by the Lord through the agency of His multifarious energies, but this manifestation is bewildering to the living entities. The Lord is therefore the master of the energies, whereas the living entities are subjugated by them. By asking various questions about transcendental activities, Vidura is clearing the misconception that when the Lord either descends to the earth in His incarnation or appears Himself with all His potencies, He too is subjected to the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, just like an ordinary living entity. This is generally the calculation of less intelligent philosophers who consider the position of the Lord and that of the living entities to be on the same level. Vidura is hearing the great sage Maitreya refute these arguments. The Lord is described in this verse as cin-m\u0101tra, or completely spiritual. The Personality of Godhead has unlimited potencies to create and manifest many wonderful things, both temporary and permanent. Because this material world is the creation of His external energy, it thus appears to be temporary; it is manifested at certain intervals, maintained for some time, and again dissolved and conserved in His own energy. As described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.19), bh\u016btv\u0101 bh\u016btv\u0101 pral\u012byate. But the creation of His internal potency, the spiritual world, is not a temporary manifestation like the material world, but is eternal and full of transcendental knowledge, opulence, energy, strength, beauties and glories. Such manifestations of the Lord\u2019s potencies are eternal and are therefore called nirgu\u1e47a, or free from all tinges of the modes of material nature, even up to the mode of material goodness. The spiritual world is transcendental even to material goodness and thus is unchangeable. Since the Supreme Lord of such eternal and unchangeable qualities is never subjugated by anything like material influence, how can His activities and form be conceived to be under the influence of illusory m\u0101y\u0101, as is the case with the living entities? A juggler or magician displays many wonders with his acts and arts. He can become a cow by his magical tactics, and yet he is not that cow; but at the same time, the cow displayed by the magician is not different from him. Similarly, the material potency is not different from the Lord because it is an emanation from Him, but at the same time, that manifestation of potency is not the Supreme Lord. The Lord\u2019s transcendental knowledge and potency always remain the same; they do not change, even when displayed in the material world. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord descends to the earth by His own internal potency, and therefore there is no question of His becoming materially contaminated, changed or otherwise affected by the modes of material nature. The Lord is sagu\u1e47a by His own internal potency, but at the same time He is nirgu\u1e47a, since He is not in touch with the material energy. The restrictions of the prison house are applicable to prisoners who are condemned by the king\u2019s law, but the king is never affected by such implications, although he may visit the prison house out of his good will. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a the six opulences of the Lord are stated to be nondifferent from Him. The opulences of transcendental knowledge, strength, opulence, potency, beauty and renunciation are all identical with the Personality of Godhead. When He personally displays such opulences in the material world, they have no connection with the modes of material nature. The very word cin-m\u0101tratva is the guarantee that the Lord\u2019s activities are always transcendental, even when displayed in the material world. His activities are as good as the Supreme Personality Himself; otherwise, liberated devotees like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b would not have been attracted by them. Vidura inquired how the Lord\u2019s activities can be in the modes of material nature, as is sometimes miscalculated by persons with a poor fund of knowledge. The inebriety of the material qualities is due to the difference between the material body and the spirit soul. The conditioned soul\u2019s activities are displayed through the medium of the modes of material nature and are therefore perverted in appearance. However, the Lord\u2019s body and the Lord Himself are one and the same, and when the Lord\u2019s activities are displayed, they are certainly nondifferent from the Lord in all respects. The conclusion is that persons who consider the Lord\u2019s activities material are certainly mistaken."

The living entity cannot be forgetful of his real identity unless influenced by the avidy\u0101 potency. Because the living entity is prone to the influence of the avidy\u0101 potency, he can never equal the supreme potent."

The individual soul is eating the fruit of the tree, but the Supersoul, the Lord, is witnessing the activities of the other bird. A citizen of the state may be in miseries for want of sufficient supervision by the state authority, but how can it be possible that a citizen suffers from other citizens while the chief of the state is personally present? From another point of view, it is understood that the j\u012bva living entity is qualitatively one with the Lord, and thus his knowledge in the pure state of life cannot be covered by nescience, especially in the presence of the Supreme Lord. How then does the living entity become subjected to ignorance and covered by the influence of m\u0101y\u0101? The Lord is the father and protector of every living entity, and He is known as the bh\u016bta-bh\u1e5bt, or the maintainer of the living entities. Why then should the living entity be subjected to so many sufferings and misfortunes? It should not be so, but actually we see that it happens everywhere. This question is therefore put forward by Vidura for solution."

        "purport": " Sometimes it appears that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is one-hundred-percent spiritual, cannot be the cause of the illusory potency which covers the knowledge of the individual soul. But factually there is no doubt that the illusory, external energy is also part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. When Vy\u0101sadeva realized the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he saw the Lord along with His external potency, which covers the pure knowledge of the individual living entities. Why the external energy acts in this way may be considered as follows, as analyzed by great commentators like Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura and \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. Although the material, illusory energy is distinct from the spiritual energy, it is one of the many energies of the Lord, and thus the material modes of nature (the mode of goodness, etc.) are surely qualities of the Lord. The energy and the energetic Personality of Godhead are not different, and although such energy is one with the Lord, He is never overpowered by it. Although the living entities are also parts and parcels of the Lord, they are overcome by the material energy. The inconceivable yogam ai\u015bvaram of the Lord, as mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.5), is misunderstood by the froggish philosophers. In order to support a theory that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (the Lord Himself) becomes a daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, a poor man, they propose that the material energy overcomes the Supreme Lord. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, however, offer a very nice example in explanation. They say that although the sun is all light, the clouds, darkness and snowfall are all part and parcel of the sun. Without the sun there is no possibility of the sky\u2019s being overcast with clouds or darkness, nor can there be snowfall on the earth. Although life is sustained by the sun, life is also disturbed by darkness and snowfall produced by the sun. But it is also a fact that the sun itself is never overcome by darkness, clouds or snowfall; the sun is far, far away from such disturbances. Only those who have a poor fund of knowledge say that the sun is covered by a cloud or by darkness. Similarly, the Supreme Brahman, or the Parabrahman, the Personality of Godhead, is always unaffected by the influence of the material energy, although it is one of His energies (par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate). There is no reason to assert that the Supreme Brahman is overpowered by the illusory energy. The clouds, darkness and snowfall can cover only a very insignificant portion of the sun\u2019s rays. Similarly, the modes of material nature may react upon the raylike living entities. It is the misfortune of the living entity, certainly not without reason, that the influence of the material energy acts on his pure consciousness and eternal bliss. This covering up of pure consciousness and eternal bliss is due to avidy\u0101-karm\u0101-sa\u1e41j\u00f1\u0101, the energy which acts on the infinitesimal living entities who misuse their minute independence. According to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and all other Vedic literatures, the living entities are generated from the ta\u1e6dasth\u0101 energy of the Lord, and thus they are always the energy of the Lord and are not the energetic. The living entities are like the sun\u2019s rays. Although, as explained above, there is no qualitative difference between the sun and its rays, the sun\u2019s rays are sometimes overpowered by another energy of the sun, namely by clouds or by snowfall. Similarly, although the living entities are qualitatively one with the superior energy of the Lord, they have the tendency to be overpowered by the inferior, material energy. In the Vedic hymns it is said that the living entities are like the sparks of a fire. The sparks of fire also are fire, but the burning potency of the sparks is different from that of the original fire. When the sparks fly out of touch with the original fire, they come under the influence of a nonfiery atmosphere; thus they maintain the potency to be again one with the fire as sparks, but not as the original fire. The sparks can everlastingly remain within the original fire as its parts and parcels, but the moment the sparks become separated from the original fire, their misfortunes and miseries begin. The clear conclusion is that the Supreme Lord, who is the original fire, is never overpowered, but the infinitesimal sparks of the fire can become overpowered by the illusory effect of m\u0101y\u0101. It is a most ludicrous argument to say that the Supreme Lord is overpowered by His own material energy. The Lord is the master of the material energy, but the living entities are in the conditioned state, controlled by the material energy. That is the version of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The froggish philosophers who put forward the argument that the Supreme Lord is overpowered by the material mode of goodness are themselves illusioned by the same material energy, although they think of themselves as liberated souls. They support their arguments by a false and laborious jugglery of words, which is a gift of the same illusory energy of the Lord. But the poor froggish philosophers, due to a false sense of knowledge, cannot understand the situation. In the Sixth Canto, Ninth Chapter, thirty-fourth verse, of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated: Thus the demigods prayed to the Supreme Lord that although His activities are very difficult to understand, they can still be understood to some extent by those who sincerely engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The demigods admitted that although the Lord is apart from the material influence or creation, He nevertheless creates, maintains and annihilates the complete cosmic manifestation by the agency of the demigods."

        "translation": "The living entity is in distress regarding his self-identity. He has no factual background, like a man who dreams that he sees his head cut off.",
        "purport": " A teacher in school once threatened his pupil that he would cut off the pupil\u2019s head and hang it on the wall so that the child could see how his head had been cut off. The child became frightened and stopped his mischief. Similarly, the miseries of the pure soul and the disruption of his self-identification are managed by the external energy of the Lord, which controls those mischievous living entities who want to go against the will of the Lord. Actually there is no bondage or misery for the living entity, nor does he ever lose his pure knowledge. In his pure consciousness, when he thinks a little seriously about his position, he can understand that he is eternally subordinate to the mercy of the Supreme and that his attempt to become one with the Supreme Lord is a false illusion. Life after life the living entity falsely tries to lord it over material nature and become the lord of the material world, but there is no tangible result. At last, when frustrated, he gives up his material activities and tries to become one with the Lord and speculate with much jugglery of words, but without success. These activities are performed under the dictation of the illusory energy. The experience is compared to the experience of one\u2019s having his head cut off in a dream. The man whose head has been cut off also sees that his head has been cut off. If a person\u2019s head is severed he loses his power to see. Therefore if a man sees that his head has been cut off, it means that he thinks like that in hallucination. Similarly a living entity is eternally subordinate to the Supreme Lord, and he has this knowledge with him, but, artificially, he thinks that he is God himself and that although he is God he has lost his knowledge due to m\u0101y\u0101. This conception has no meaning, just as there is no meaning to seeing one\u2019s head being cut off. This is the process by which knowledge is covered. And because this artificial rebellious condition of the living entity gives him all troubles, it is to be understood that he should take to his normal life as a devotee of the Lord and be relieved from the misconception of being God. The so-called liberation of thinking oneself God is that last reaction of avidy\u0101 by which the living entity is entrapped. The conclusion is that a living entity deprived of eternal transcendental service to the Lord becomes illusioned in many ways. Even in his conditional life he is the eternal servant of the Lord. His servitude under the spell of illusory m\u0101y\u0101 is also a manifestation of his eternal condition of service. Because he has rebelled against the service of the Lord, he is therefore put in the service of the m\u0101y\u0101. He is still serving, but in a perverted manner. When he wants to get out of service under material bondage, he next desires to become one with the Lord. This is another illusion. The best course, therefore, is to surrender unto the Lord and thus get rid of the illusory m\u0101y\u0101 for good, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14):"

        "purport": " The Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, is compared to the moon in the sky, and the living entities are compared to the reflection of the moon on water. The moon in the sky is fixed and does not appear to quiver like the moon on the water. Actually, like the original moon in the sky, the moon reflected on the water should also not quiver, but because of being associated with water, the reflection appears to be quivering, although in actual fact the moon is fixed. The water moves, but the moon does not move. Similarly, the living entities appear to be tainted by material qualities like illusion, lamentation and miseries, although in the pure soul such qualities are completely absent. The word prat\u012byate, which means \u201capparently\u201d and \u201cnot actually\u201d (like the experience of having one\u2019s head cut off in a dream), is significant here. The reflection of the moon on the water is the separated rays of the moon and not the actual moon. The separated parts and parcels of the Lord entangled in the water of material existence have the quivering quality, whereas the Lord is like the actual moon in the sky, which is not at all in touch with water. The light of the sun and moon reflected on matter makes the matter bright and praiseworthy. The living symptoms are compared to the light of the sun and the moon illuminating material manifestations like trees and mountains. The reflection of the sun or moon is accepted as the real sun or moon by less intelligent men, and the pure monistic philosophy develops from these ideas. In fact, the light of the sun and the moon are actually different from the sun and moon themselves, although they are always connected. The light of the moon spread throughout the sky appears to be impersonal, but the moon planet, as it is, is personal, and the living entities on the moon planet are also personal. In the rays of the moon, different material entities appear to be comparatively more or less important. The light of the moon on the Taj Mahal appears to be more beautiful than the same light in the wilderness. Although the light of the moon is the same everywhere, due to being differently appreciated it appears different. Similarly, the light of the Lord is equally distributed everywhere, but due to being differently received, it appears to be different. One should not, therefore, accept the reflection of the moon on the water as actual and misunderstand the whole situation through monistic philosophy. The quivering quality of the moon is also variable. When the water is standing still, there is no quivering. A more settled conditioned soul quivers less, but due to material connection the quivering quality is more or less present everywhere."

As discussed in the First Canto, because the application of devotional service to Lord V\u0101sudeva invites pure knowledge, it quickly detaches one from the material conception of life and thus revives one\u2019s normal condition of spiritual existence, even in this life, and frees one from the material winds which cause one to quiver. Only knowledge in devotional service can elevate one towards the path of liberation. The development of knowledge for the purpose of knowing everything, without rendering devotional service, is considered fruitless labor, and one cannot get the desired result by such labor of love. Lord V\u0101sudeva is pleased by devotional service only, and thus His mercy is realized by association with pure devotees of the Lord. Pure devotees of the Lord are transcendental to all material desires, including the desire for the results of fruitive activities and philosophical speculation. If one wants to acquire the mercy of the Lord, he has to associate with pure devotees. Such association alone can, by degrees, release one from the quivering elements."

        "purport": " The quivering of the living entity as described above is due to the senses. Since the entire material existence is meant for sense gratification, the senses are the medium of material activities, and they cause the quivering of the steady soul. Therefore, these senses are to be detached from all such material activities. According to the impersonalists the senses are stopped from work by merging the soul in the Supersoul Brahman. The devotees, however, do not stop the material senses from acting, but they engage their transcendental senses in the service of the Transcendence, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In either case, the activities of the senses in the material field are to be stopped by cultivation of knowledge, and, if possible, they can be engaged in the service of the Lord. The senses are transcendental in nature, but their activities become polluted when contaminated by matter. We have to treat the senses to cure them of the material disease, not stop them from acting, as suggested by the impersonalist. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.59) it is said that one ceases all material activities only when satisfied by contact with a better engagement. Consciousness is active by nature and cannot be stopped from working. Artificially stopping a mischievous child is not the real remedy. The child must be given some better engagement so that he will automatically stop causing mischief. In the same way, the mischievous activities of the senses can be stopped only by better engagement in relation with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the eyes are engaged in seeing the beautiful form of the Lord, the tongue engaged in tasting pras\u0101da, or remnants of foodstuff offered to the Lord, the ears are engaged in hearing His glories, the hands engaged in cleaning the temple of the Lord, the legs engaged in visiting His temples \u2014 or when all the senses are engaged in transcendental variegatedness \u2014 then only can the transcendental senses become satiated and eternally free from material engagement. The Lord, as the Supersoul residing in everyone\u2019s heart and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the transcendental world far beyond the material creation, is the seer of all our activities. Our activities must be so transcendentally saturated that the Lord will be kind enough to look upon us favorably and engage us in His transcendental service; then only can the senses be satisfied completely and be no longer troubled by material attraction."

Therefore what to speak of those who have attained attraction for serving the flavor of the dust of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet?",
        "purport": " Two different methods for controlling the material senses are recommended in the Vedic scriptural wisdom. One of them is the process of j\u00f1\u0101na, or the path of philosophical understanding of the Supreme \u2014 Brahma, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n. The other is that of direct engagement in the transcendental loving devotional service of the Lord. Of these two most popular methods, the path of devotional service is recommended here as the best because one on the path of devotional service does not have to wait for the attainment of the fruitive results of pious activities or for the results of knowledge. The two stages of executing devotional service are, first, the stage of practicing devotional service with our present senses under the regulations of the recognized scriptures and, second, attaining sincere attachment for serving the particles of the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord. The first stage is called s\u0101dhana-bhakti, or devotional service for the neophyte, which is rendered under the direction of a pure devotee, and the second stage is called r\u0101ga-bhakti, in which the mature devotee automatically takes to the various services of the Lord out of sincere attachment. The great sage Maitreya now gives the final answer to all the questions of Vidura: devotional service to the Lord is the ultimate means to mitigate all the miserable conditions of material existence. The path of knowledge or that of mystic gymnastics may be adopted as a means for the purpose, but unless mixed with bhakti, or devotional service, they are unable to award the desired result. By practicing s\u0101dhana-bhakti one may gradually rise to the point of r\u0101ga-bhakti, and by performing r\u0101ga-bhakti in loving transcendental service one can even control the Supreme Powerful Lord."

Similarly, human beings who are unaware of the miseries of material existence and are happy in sex life and hard labor are the lowest of fools. Yet because they have no sense of miseries, they supposedly enjoy so-called happiness. The other class of men, those who are liberated and are situated in the transcendental position above intelligence, are really happy and are called paramaha\u1e41sas.

All these divisions are based on the particular nature of each individual person, not on the principle of birth. Birth is not mentioned in this verse because birth is immaterial. Vidura is famous in history as born of a \u015b\u016bdr\u0101\u1e47\u012b mother, yet he is more than a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by qualification because he is seen here to be the disciple of a great sage, Maitreya Muni. Unless one achieves at least the brahminical qualifications, one cannot understand the Vedic hymns. Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is also a division of the Vedas, but it is meant for women, \u015b\u016bdras and dvija-bandhus, the worthless children of the higher section. The less intelligent section of society can avail themselves of the Vedic instructions simply by studying the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata."

But above them are the pure devotees, whose devotion is not tainted by any material tinges of fruitive work or speculative knowledge.

He lies on the water by His own internal potency, and I worship that original Supreme Godhead. \u201cDue to His breathing, innumerable universes come into existence, and when He withdraws His breath there occurs the dissolution of all the lords of the universes. That plenary portion of the Supreme Lord is called Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and He is a part of the part of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

The Lord and His eternal associates remain after the dissolution. Vidura\u2019s inquiry about such persons is a clear indication of the existence of all the paraphernalia of the Lord. This is also confirmed in the K\u0101\u015b\u012b-kha\u1e47\u1e0da, as quoted by both J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, who follow in the footsteps of \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b. \u201cThe devotees of the Lord never annihilate their individual existences, not even after the dissolution of the entire cosmic manifestation.

That is His real identity. Therefore, when the living entity accepts this supreme proprietorship of the Lord and acts in that attitude, he resumes his real identity. In order to elevate the living entity to this standard of knowledge, there is the necessity of spiritual association. The bona fide spiritual master desires that his disciples know the process of rendering transcendental service to the Lord, and the disciples also know that they have to learn about the eternal relationship between God and the living entity from a self-realized soul. To disseminate transcendental knowledge one must retire from mundane activities on the strength of enlightenment in knowledge in terms of Vedic wisdom.

They decry the necessity of the spiritual master and try themselves to take his place by propagating the theory that a spiritual master is not necessary. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, however, does not approve this viewpoint. Even the great transcendental scholar Vy\u0101sadeva had need of a spiritual master, and under the instruction of his spiritual master, N\u0101rada, he prepared this sublime literature, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Even Lord Caitanya, although He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, accepted a spiritual master; even Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a accepted a spiritual master, S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni, in order to be enlightened; and all the \u0101c\u0101ryas and saints of the world had spiritual masters. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Arjuna accepted Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his spiritual master, although there was no necessity of such a formal declaration. So, in all cases, there is no question about the necessity of accepting a spiritual master. The only stipulation is that the spiritual master should be bona fide; i.e., the spiritual master must be in the proper chain of disciplic succession, called the parampar\u0101 system. S\u016bris are great scholars, but they may not always be anagha, or spotless. The anagha-s\u016bri is one who is a pure devotee of the Lord. Those who are not pure devotees of the Lord, or who want to be on an equal level with Him, are not anagha-s\u016bri. Pure devotees have prepared many books of knowledge on the basis of authorized scriptures. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and his assistants, under the instructions of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, have all written various literatures for the guidance of prospective devotees, and anyone who is very serious about raising himself to the standard of a pure devotee of the Lord must take advantage of those literatures."

        "purport": " The highest perfectional work of charity is to give people in general immunity from the anxieties of material existence. This can be done only by performing activities in devotional service to the Lord. Such knowledge is incomparable. Cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedas, performance of sacrifice, and distribution of munificent charities all together cannot form even a part of the immunity from the pangs of material existence that is gained from devotional service. The charity of Maitreya not only will help Vidura, but, due to its universal nature, will deliver all others in all times. Thus Maitreya is immortal."
