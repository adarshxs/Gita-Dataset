        "purport": " From his very birth, Uddhava was a natural devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or a nitya-siddha, a liberated soul. From natural instinct he used to serve Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even in his childhood. He used to play with dolls in the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He would serve the dolls by dressing, feeding and worshiping them, and thus he was constantly absorbed in the play of transcendental realization. These are the signs of an eternally liberated soul. An eternally liberated soul is a devotee of the Lord who never forgets Him. Human life is meant for reviving one\u2019s eternal relation with the Lord, and all religious injunctions are meant for awakening this dormant instinct of the living entity. The sooner this awakening is brought about, the quicker the mission of human life is fulfilled. In a good family of devotees, the child gets the opportunity to serve the Lord in many ways. A soul who is already advanced in devotional service has the opportunity to take birth in such an enlightened family. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.41). \u015auc\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 \u015br\u012bmat\u0101\u1e41 gehe yoga-bhra\u1e63\u1e6do\u00a0\u2019bhij\u0101yate: even the fallen devotee gets the opportunity to take his birth in the family of a well-situated br\u0101hma\u1e47a or in a rich, well-to-do mercantile family. In both these families there is a good opportunity to revive one\u2019s sense of God consciousness automatically because particularly in these families the worship of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is regularly performed and the child gets the opportunity to imitate the process of worship called arcan\u0101. The p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b formula for training persons in devotional service is temple worship, whereby the neophytes get the opportunity to learn devotional service to the Lord. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it also used to play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a dolls in his childhood. In India the children in good families are still given dolls of the Lord like R\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or sometimes the demigods, so that they may develop the aptitude of service to the Lord. By the grace of the Lord we were given the same opportunity by our parents, and the beginning of our life was based on this principle."

        "purport": " Transcendental service to the Lord is not mundane. The service attitude of the devotee gradually increases and never becomes slackened. Generally, in old age a person is allowed retirement from mundane service. But in the transcendental service of the Lord there is no retirement at all; on the contrary, the service attitude increases more and more with the progress of age. In the transcendental service there is no satiation, and therefore there is no retirement. Materially, when a man becomes tired by rendering service in his physical body, he is allowed retirement, but in the transcendental service there is no feeling of fatigue because it is spiritual service and is not on the bodily plane. Service on the bodily plane dwindles as the body grows older, but the spirit is never old, and therefore on the spiritual plane the service is never tiresome. Uddhava undoubtedly became old, but that does not mean that his spirit became old. His service attitude matured on the transcendental plane, and therefore as soon as he was questioned by Vidura about Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he at once remembered his Lord by reference to the context and forgot himself on the physical plane. That is the sign of pure devotional service to the Lord, as will be explained later on (lak\u1e63a\u1e47a\u1e41 bhakti-yogasya, etc.) in Lord Kapila\u2019s instructions to His mother, Devah\u016bti."

        "purport": " The symptoms of the highest order of devotional life were observed by Vidura, an experienced devotee of the Lord, and he confirmed Uddhava\u2019s perfectional stage of love of Godhead. Ecstatic bodily changes are manifested from the spiritual plane and are not artificial expressions developed by practice. There are three different stages of development in devotional service. The first stage is that of following the regulative principles prescribed in the codes of devotional service, the second stage is that of assimilation and realization of the steady condition of devotional service, and the last stage is that of ecstasy symptomized by transcendental bodily expression. The nine different modes of devotional service, such as hearing, chanting and remembering, are the beginning of the process. By regular hearing of the glories and pastimes of the Lord, the impurities in the student\u2019s heart begin to be washed off. The more one is cleansed of impurities, the more one becomes fixed in devotional service. Gradually the activities take the forms of steadiness, firm faith, taste, realization and assimilation, one after another. These different stages of gradual development increase love of God to the highest stage, and in the highest stage there are still more symptoms, such as affection, anger and attachment, gradually rising in exceptional cases to the mah\u0101-bh\u0101va stage, which is generally not possible for the living entities. All these were manifested by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, the personification of love of God. In the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the chief disciple of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, these transcendental symptoms displayed by pure devotees like Uddhava are systematically described. We have written a summary study of Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu entitled The Nectar of Devotion, and one may consult this book for more detailed information on the science of devotional service."

        "purport": " When Uddhava was fully absorbed in the transcendental ecstasy of love of God, he actually forgot all about the external world. The pure devotee lives constantly in the abode of the Supreme Lord, even in the present body, which apparently belongs to this world. The pure devotee is not exactly on the bodily plane, since he is absorbed in the transcendental thought of the Supreme. When Uddhava wanted to speak to Vidura, he came down from the abode of the Lord, Dv\u0101rak\u0101, to the material plane of human beings. Even though a pure devotee is present on this mortal planet, he is here in relation to the Lord for engagement in transcendental loving service, and not for any material cause. A living entity can live either on the material plane or in the transcendental abode of the Lord, in accordance with his existential condition. The conditional changes of the living entity are explained in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta in the instructions given to \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya: \u201cThe living entities all over the universes are enjoying the effects of the respective fruitive results of their own work, life after life. Out of all of them, some may be influenced by the association of pure devotees and thus get the chance to execute devotional service by attainment of taste. This taste is the seed of devotional service, and one who is fortunate enough to have received such a seed is advised to sow it in the core of his heart. As one cultivates a seed by pouring water to fructify it, the seed of devotional service sown in the heart of the devotee may be cultured by pouring water in the form of hearing and chanting of the holy name and pastimes of the Lord. The creeper of devotional service, so nourished, gradually grows, and the devotee, acting as a gardener, goes on pouring the water of constant hearing and chanting. The creeper of devotional service gradually grows so high that it passes through the entire material universe and enters into the spiritual sky, growing still higher and higher until it reaches the planet Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. The devotee-gardener is in touch with the abode of the Lord even from the material plane by dint of performing devotional service to the Lord simply by hearing and chanting. As a creeper takes shelter of another, stronger tree, similarly the creeper of devotional service, nourished by the devotee, takes shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and thus becomes fixed. When the creeper is fixed, then the fruit of the creeper comes into existence, and the gardener who nourished it is able to enjoy this fruit of love, and his life becomes successful.\u201d That Uddhava attained this stage is evident from his dealings. He could simultaneously reach the supreme planet and still appear in this world."

        "translation": "\u015ar\u012b Uddhava said: My dear Vidura, the sun of the world, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has set, and our house has now been swallowed by the great snake of time. What can I say to you about our welfare?",
        "purport": " The disappearance of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sun may be explained as follows, according to the commentary of \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura. Vidura was struck with great sorrow when he got the hint of the annihilation of the great Yadu dynasty as well as of his own family, the Kuru dynasty. Uddhava could understand the grief of Vidura, and therefore he first of all wanted to sympathize with him by saying that after the sunset everyone is in darkness. Since the entire world was merged in the darkness of grief, neither Vidura nor Uddhava nor anyone else could be happy. Uddhava was as much aggrieved as Vidura, and there was nothing further to be said about their welfare. The comparison of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to the sun is very appropriate. As soon as the sun sets, darkness automatically appears. But the darkness experienced by the common man does not affect the sun itself either at the time of sunrise or of sunset. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance and disappearance are exactly like that of the sun. He appears and disappears in innumerable universes, and as long as He is present in a particular universe there is all transcendental light in that universe, but the universe from which He passes away is put into darkness. His pastimes, however, are everlasting. The Lord is always present in some universe, just as the sun is present in either the Eastern or the Western Hemisphere. The sun is always present either in India or in America, but when the sun is present in India, the American land is in darkness, and when the sun is present in America, the Indian hemisphere is in darkness. As the sun appears in the morning and gradually rises to the meridian and then again sets in one hemisphere while simultaneously rising in the other, so Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s disappearance in one universe and the beginning of His different pastimes in another take place simultaneously. As soon as one pastime is finished here, it is manifested in another universe. And thus His nitya-l\u012bl\u0101, or eternal pastimes, are going on without ending. As the sunrise takes place once in twenty-four hours, similarly the pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a take place in a universe once in a daytime of Brahm\u0101, the account of which is given in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as 4,300,000,000 solar years. But wherever the Lord is present, all His different pastimes as described in the revealed scriptures take place at regular intervals. As at sunset the snakes become powerful, thieves are encouraged, ghosts become active, the lotus becomes disfigured and the cakrav\u0101k\u012b laments, so with the disappearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the atheists feel enlivened, and the devotees become sorry."

        "purport": " Uddhava lamented for the unfortunate persons of the world who could not recognize Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in spite of seeing all His transcendental godly qualities. From the very beginning of His appearance within the prison bars of King Ka\u1e41sa up to His mausala-l\u012bl\u0101, although He exhibited His potencies as the Personality of Godhead in the six opulences of wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, the foolish persons of the world could not understand that He was the Supreme Lord, Foolish persons might have thought Him an extraordinary historic figure because they had no intimate touch with the Lord, but more unfortunate were the family members of the Lord, the members of the Yadu dynasty, who were always in company with the Lord but were unable to recognize Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Uddhava lamented his own fortune also because although he knew K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he could not properly use the opportunity to render devotional service to the Lord. He regretted everyone\u2019s misfortune, including his own. The pure devotee of the Lord thinks himself most unfortunate. That is due to excessive love for the Lord and is one of the transcendental perceptions of viraha, the suffering of separation. It is learned from the revealed scriptures that the moon was born from the Milk Ocean. There is a Milk Ocean in the upper planets, and there Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who controls the heart of every living being as Param\u0101tm\u0101 (the Supersoul), resides as the K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Those who do not believe in the existence of the Ocean of Milk because they have experience only of the salty water in the ocean should know that the world is also called the go, which means the cow. The urine of a cow is salty, and according to \u0100yur-vedic medicine the cow\u2019s urine is very effective in treating patients suffering from liver trouble. Such patients may not have any experience of the cow\u2019s milk because milk is never given to liver patients. But the liver patient may know that the cow has milk also, although he has never tasted it. Similarly, men who have experience only of this tiny planet where the saltwater ocean exists may take information from the revealed scriptures that there is also an ocean of milk, although we have never seen it. From this Ocean of Milk the moon was born, but the fish in the Milk Ocean could not recognize that the moon was not another fish and was different from them. The fish took the moon to be one of them or maybe something illuminating, but nothing more. The unfortunate persons who do not recognize Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are like such fish. They take Him to be one of them, although a little extraordinary in opulence, strength, etc. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11) confirms such foolish persons to be most unfortunate: avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam."

He can be known only by one who has the mercy of the Lord. The Y\u0101davas were all exceptionally learned and experienced, but in spite of their knowing the Lord as the one who lives in everyone\u2019s heart, they could not understand that He is the original Personality of Godhead. This lack of knowledge was not due to their insufficient erudition; it was due to their misfortune. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, however, the Lord was not even known as the Param\u0101tm\u0101 because the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana were pure unconventional devotees of the Lord and could think of Him only as their object of love.

        "purport": " Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to all the evidences of the Vedas. He is accepted by all \u0101c\u0101ryas, including \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya. But when He was present in the world, different classes of men accepted Him differently, and therefore their calculations of the Lord were also different. Generally, persons who had faith in the revealed scriptures accepted the Lord as He is, and all of them merged into great bereavement when the Lord disappeared from the world. In the First Canto we have already discussed the lamentation of Arjuna and Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, to whom the disappearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was almost intolerable up to the end of their lives. The Y\u0101davas were only partially cognizant of the Lord, but they are also glorious because they had the opportunity to associate with the Lord, who acted as the head of their family, and they also rendered the Lord intimate service. The Y\u0101davas and other devotees of the Lord are different from those who wrongly calculated Him to be an ordinary human personality. Such persons are certainly bewildered by the illusory energy. They are hellish and are envious of the Supreme Lord. The illusory energy acts very powerfully on them because in spite of their elevated mundane education, such persons are faithless and are infected by the mentality of atheism. They are always very eager to establish that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was an ordinary man who was killed by a hunter due to His many impious acts in plotting to kill the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Jar\u0101sandha, the demoniac kings of the earth. Such persons have no faith in the statement of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the Lord is unaffected by the reactions of work: na m\u0101\u1e41 karm\u0101\u1e47i limpanti. According to the atheistic point of view, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s family, the Yadu dynasty, was vanquished due to being cursed by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as for the sins committed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in killing the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, etc. All these blasphemies do not touch the heart of the devotees of the Lord because they know perfectly well what is what. Their intelligence regarding the Lord is never disturbed. But those who are disturbed by the statements of the asuras are also condemned. That is what Uddhava meant in this verse."

        "purport": " In this verse the word avit\u1e5bpta-d\u1e5b\u015b\u0101m is most significant. The conditioned souls in the material world are all trying to satisfy their senses in various ways, but they have failed to do so because it is impossible to be satisfied by such efforts. The example of the fish on land is very appropriate. If one takes a fish from the water and puts it on the land, it cannot be made happy by any amount of offered pleasure. The spirit soul can be happy only in the association of the supreme living being, the Personality of Godhead, and nowhere else. The Lord, by His unlimited causeless mercy, has innumerable Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets in the brahmajyoti sphere of the spiritual world, and in that transcendental world there is an unlimited arrangement for the unlimited pleasure of the living entities. The Lord Himself comes to display His transcendental pastimes, typically represented at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Mathur\u0101 and Dv\u0101rak\u0101. He appears just to attract the conditioned souls back to Godhead, back home to the eternal world. But for want of sufficient piety, the onlookers are not attracted by such pastimes of the Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that only those who have completely surpassed the way of sinful reaction can engage themselves in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The entire Vedic way of ritualistic performances is to put every conditioned soul on the path of piety. By strict adherence to the prescribed principles for all orders of social life, one can attain the qualities of truthfulness, control of the mind, control of the senses, forbearance, etc., and can be elevated to the plane of rendering pure devotional service to the Lord. Only by such a transcendental vision are one\u2019s material hankerings fully satisfied. When the Lord was present, persons who were able to satisfy their material hankerings by seeing Him in true perspective were thus able to go back with Him to His kingdom. But those persons who were unable to see the Lord as He is remained attached to material hankerings and were not able to go back home, back to Godhead. When the Lord passed beyond the vision of all, He did so in His original eternal form, as stated in this verse. The Lord left in His own body; He did not leave His body as is generally misunderstood by the conditioned souls. This statement defeats the false propaganda of the faithless nondevotees that the Lord passed away like an ordinary conditioned soul. The Lord appeared in order to release the world from the undue burden of the nonbelieving asuras, and after doing this, He disappeared from the world\u2019s eyes."

These pastimes were wonderful for everyone, even for those proud of their own opulence, including the Lord Himself in His form as the Lord of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Thus His [\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s] transcendental body is the ornament of all ornaments.",
        "purport": " In conformity with the Vedic hymns (nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m), the Personality of Godhead is more excellent than all other living beings within all the universes in the material world. He is the chief of all living entities; no one can surpass Him or be equal to Him in wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge or renunciation. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was within this universe, He seemed to be a human being because He appeared in a manner just suitable for His pastimes in the mortal world. He did not appear in human society in His Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha feature with four hands because that would not have been suitable for His pastimes. But in spite of His appearing as a human being, no one was or is equal to Him in any respect in any of the six different opulences. Everyone is more or less proud of his opulence in this world, but when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was in human society, He excelled all His contemporaries within the universe. When the Lord\u2019s pastimes are visible to the human eye, they are called praka\u1e6da, and when they are not visible they are called apraka\u1e6da. In fact, the Lord\u2019s pastimes never stop, just as the sun never leaves the sky. The sun is always in its right orbit in the sky, but it is sometimes visible and sometimes invisible to our limited vision. Similarly, the pastimes of the Lord are always current in one universe or another, and when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a disappeared from the transcendental abode of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, it was simply a disappearance from the eyes of the people there. It should not be misunderstood that His transcendental body, which is just suitable for the pastimes in the mortal world, is in any way inferior to His different expansions in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas. His body manifested in the material world is transcendental par excellence in the sense that His pastimes in the mortal world excel His mercy displayed in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas. In the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas the Lord is merciful toward the liberated or nitya-mukta living entities, but in His pastimes in the mortal world He is merciful even to the fallen souls who are nitya-baddha, or conditioned forever. The six excellent opulences which He displayed in the mortal world by the agency of His internal potency, yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, are rare even in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas. All His pastimes were manifested not by the material energy but by His spiritual energy. The excellence of His r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101 at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and His householder life with sixteen thousand wives is wonderful even for N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and is certainly so for other living entities within this mortal world. His pastimes are wonderful even for other incarnations of the Lord, such as \u015ar\u012b R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha and Var\u0101ha. His opulence was so superexcellent that His pastimes were adored even by the Lord of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, who is not different from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself."

        "purport": " In His boyhood at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was notorious as a teasing friend in transcendental love to all the girls His age. His love for them was so intense that there is no comparison to that ecstasy, and the damsels of Vraja were so much attached to Him that their affection excelled that of the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a finally admitted His defeat before the transcendental affection of the gop\u012bs and declared that He was unable to repay them for their unalloyed affection. Although the gop\u012bs were seemingly anguished by the Lord\u2019s teasing behavior, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would leave them they could not tolerate the separation and used to follow Him with their eyes and minds. They were so stunned by the situation that they could not finish their household duties. No one could excel Him even in the dealing of love exchanged between boys and girls. It is said in the revealed scriptures that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally never goes beyond the boundary of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He remains there eternally because of the transcendental love of the inhabitants. Thus even though He is not visible at present, He is not away from V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana for a moment."

        "translation": "The Personality of Godhead, the all-compassionate controller of both the spiritual and material creations, is unborn, but when there is friction between His peaceful devotees and persons who are in the material modes of nature, He takes birth just like fire, accompanied by the mahat-tattva.",
        "purport": " The devotees of the Lord are by nature peaceful because they have no material hankering. A liberated soul has no hankering, and therefore he has no lamentation. One who wants to possess also laments when he loses his possession. Devotees have no hankerings for material possessions and no hankerings for spiritual salvation. They are situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord as a matter of duty, and they do not mind where they are or how they have to act. Karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs all hanker to possess some material or spiritual assets. Karm\u012bs want material possessions, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs want spiritual possessions, but devotees do not want any material or spiritual assets. They want only to serve the Lord anywhere in the material or spiritual worlds that the Lord desires, and the Lord is always specifically compassionate towards such devotees. The karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs have their particular mentalities in the modes of nature, and therefore they are called itara or nondevotees. These itaras, including even the yog\u012bs, sometimes harass the devotees of the Lord. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, a great yog\u012b, harassed Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a because the latter was a great devotee of the Lord. And the great karm\u012b and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu even harassed his own Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava son, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. There are many instances of such harassment of the peaceful devotees of the Lord by the itaras. When such friction takes place, the Lord, out of His great compassion towards His pure devotees, appears in person, accompanied by His plenary portions controlling the mahat-tattva. The Lord is everywhere, in both the material and spiritual domains, and He appears for the sake of His devotees when there is friction between His devotee and the nondevotee. As electricity is generated by friction of matter anywhere and everywhere, the Lord, being all-pervading, appears because of the friction of devotees and nondevotees. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears on a mission, all His plenary portions accompany Him. When He appeared as the son of Vasudeva, there were differences of opinion about His incarnation. Some said, \u201cHe is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d Some said, \u201cHe is an incarnation of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a,\u201d and others said, \u201cHe is the incarnation of K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\u201d But actually He is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam \u2014 and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the puru\u1e63as and all other incarnations accompany Him to function as different parts of His pastimes. Mahad-a\u1e41\u015ba-yukta\u1e25 indicates that He is accompanied by the puru\u1e63as, who create the mahat-tanva. It is confirmed in the Vedic hymns, mah\u0101nta\u1e41 vibhum \u0101tm\u0101nam. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared, just like electricity, when there was friction between Ka\u1e41sa and Vasudeva and Ugrasena. Vasudeva and Ugrasena were the Lord\u2019s devotees, and Ka\u1e41sa, a representative of the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, was a nondevotee. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as He is, is compared to the sun. He first appeared from the ocean of the womb of Devak\u012b, and gradually He satisfied the inhabitants of the places surrounding Mathur\u0101, just as the sun enlivens the lotus flower in the morning. After gradually rising to the meridian of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, the Lord set like the sun, placing everything in darkness, as described by Uddhava."

        "purport": " Because Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original person from whom everything and everyone has emanated \u2014 aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25 (Bg. 10.8), janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25 (Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra 1.1.2) \u2014 nothing can be equal to or greater than Him. The Lord is supremely perfect, and whenever He enacts His transcendental pastimes as a son, a rival or an object of enmity, He plays the part so perfectly that even pure devotees like Uddhava are bewildered. For example, Uddhava knew perfectly well that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is eternally existent and can neither die nor disappear for good, yet he lamented for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All these events are perfect arrangements to give perfection to His supreme glories. It is for enjoyment\u2019s sake. When a father plays with his little son and the father lies down on the floor as if defeated by the son, it is just to give the little son pleasure, and nothing more. Because the Lord is all-powerful, it is possible for Him to adjust opposites such as birth and no birth, power and defeat, fear and fearlessness. A pure devotee knows very well how it is possible for the Lord to adjust opposite things, but he laments for the nondevotees who, not knowing the supreme glories of the Lord, think of Him as imaginary simply because there are so many apparently contradictory statements in the scriptures. Factually there is nothing contradictory; everything is possible when we understand the Lord as the Lord and not as one of us, with all our imperfection."

He said, \u201cO mother, O father, please excuse Us for this inability.\u201d All this behavior of the Lord gives me pain at heart.",
        "purport": " It appears that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Baladeva were both very greatly afraid of Ka\u1e41sa, and therefore They had to hide Themselves. But if Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Baladeva are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, how was it possible that They were afraid of Ka\u1e41sa? Is there any contradiction in such statements? Vasudeva, due to his great appreciation for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, wanted to give Him protection. He never thought that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the Supreme Lord and could protect Himself; he thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his son. Because Vasudeva was a great devotee of the Lord, he did not like to think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a might be killed like his other children. Morally, Vasudeva was bound to deliver K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to the hands of Ka\u1e41sa because he had promised to turn over all his children. But out of his great love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he broke his promise, and the Lord was very pleased with Vasudeva for his transcendental mentality. He did not want to disturb the intense affection of Vasudeva, and thus He agreed to be carried by His father to the house of Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101. And just to test the intense love of Vasudeva, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fell down in the waters of the Yamun\u0101 while His father was crossing the river. Vasudeva became mad after his child as he tried to recover Him in the midst of the rising river. These are all glorified pastimes of the Lord, and there is no contradiction in such manifestations. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord, He was never afraid of Ka\u1e41sa, but to please His father He agreed to be so. And the most brilliant part of His supreme character was that He begged pardon from His parents for being unable to serve their feet while absent from home because of fear of Ka\u1e41sa. The Lord, whose lotus feet are worshiped by demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, wanted to worship the feet of Vasudeva. Such instruction by the Lord to the world is quite appropriate. Even if one is the Supreme Lord, one must serve his parents. A son is indebted to his parents in so many ways, and it is the duty of the son to serve his parents, however great the son may be. Indirectly, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to teach the atheists who do not accept the supreme fatherhood of God, and they may learn from this action how much the Supreme Father has to be respected. Uddhava was simply struck with wonder by such glorious behavior of the Lord, and he was very sorry that he was unable to go with Him."

He was merciful even to His enemy the King of Cedi, who always tried to be an envious rival of the Lord. Because it is not possible to be a bona fide rival of the Lord, the King of Cedi was extremely malicious toward Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this he was like many other asuras, such as Ka\u1e41sa and Jar\u0101sandha. In the open assembly of the r\u0101jas\u016bya sacrifice performed by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la insulted Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he was finally killed by the Lord. But it was seen by everyone in the assembly that a light flashed out of the body of the King of Cedi and merged into the body of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This means that Cedir\u0101ja achieved the salvation of attaining oneness with the Supreme, which is a perfection most desired by the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs and for which they execute their different types of transcendental activities. It is a fact that persons who are trying to understand the Supreme Truth by their personal endeavors of mental speculation or mystic powers of yoga achieve the same goal as others who are personally killed by the Lord. Both achieve the salvation of merging in the brahmajyoti rays of the transcendental body of the Lord. The Lord was merciful even to His enemy, and the success of the King of Cedi was observed by everyone who was present in the assembly. Vidura was also present there, and therefore Uddhava referred the incident to his memory."

        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appears in this world for two missionary purposes: to deliver the faithful and to annihilate the miscreants. But because the Lord is absolute, His two different kinds of actions, although apparently different, are ultimately one and the same. His annihilation of a person like \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la is as auspicious as His actions for the protection of the faithful. All the warriors who fought against Arjuna but who were able to see the lotuslike face of the Lord on the battlefront achieved the abode of the Lord, exactly as the devotees of the Lord do. The words \u201cpleasing to the eyes of the seer\u201d are very significant. When the warriors from the other side of the battlefield saw Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the front, they appreciated His beauty, and their dormant instinct of love of God was awakened. \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la saw the Lord also, but he saw Him as his enemy, and his love was not awakened. Therefore \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la achieved oneness with the Lord by merging in the impersonal glare of His body, called the brahmajyoti. Others, who were in the marginal position, being neither friends nor enemies but slightly in love of Godhead by appreciating the beauty of His face, were at once promoted to the spiritual planets, the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas. The Lord\u2019s personal abode is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and the abodes where His plenary expansions reside are called the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas, where the Lord is present as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Love of Godhead is dormant in every living entity, and the entire process of devotional service unto the Lord is meant for awakening this dormant eternal love of Godhead. But there are degrees of such transcendental awakening. Those whose love of God is awakened to the fullest extent go back to the Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana planet in the spiritual sky, whereas persons who have just awakened to love of Godhead by accident or association are transferred to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Essentially there is no material difference between Goloka and Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, but in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas the Lord is served in unlimited opulence, whereas in Goloka the Lord is served in natural affection. This love of God is awakened by the association of pure devotees of the Lord. Here the word p\u0101rth\u0101stra-p\u016bta\u1e25 is significant. Those who saw the beautiful face of the Lord on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra were purified first by Arjuna when he made his onslaught with arrows. The Lord appeared for the mission of diminishing the burden of the world, and Arjuna was assisting the Lord by fighting on His behalf. Arjuna personally declined to fight, and the whole instruction of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was given to Arjuna to engage him in the fight. As a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna agreed to fight in preference to his own decision, and thus Arjuna fought to assist the Lord in His mission of diminishing the burden of the world. All the activities of a pure devotee are executed on behalf of the Lord because a pure devotee of the Lord has nothing to do for his personal interest. Arjuna\u2019s killing was as good as killing by the Lord Himself. As soon as Arjuna shot an arrow at an enemy, that enemy became purified of all material contaminations and became eligible to be transferred to the spiritual sky. Those warriors who appreciated the lotus feet of the Lord and saw His face at the front had their dormant love of God awakened, and thus they were transferred at once to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, not to the impersonal state of brahmajyoti, as was \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la. \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la died without appreciating the Lord, while others died with appreciation of the Lord. Both were transferred to the spiritual sky, but those who awakened to love of God were transferred to the planets of the transcendental sky. Uddhava seemingly lamented that his own position was less than that of the warriors on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra because they had attained to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha whereas he remained to lament the disappearance of the Lord."

Others, who are not devotees, are bewildered by such behavior of the Lord, who acted just like a human being. This bewilderment is explained by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11) as follows: Persons with a poor fund of knowledge belittle the Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not knowing His exalted position as the Lord of everything. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord has explained His position clearly, but the demoniac, atheistic student squeezes out an interpretation to suit his own purpose and misleads unfortunate followers into the same mentality. Such unfortunate persons merely pick up some slogans from the great book of knowledge, but are unable to estimate the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pure devotees like Uddhava, however, are never misled by such atheistic opportunists."

In His babyhood, He was administered deadly poison by P\u016btan\u0101, a she-demon who tried to kill the wonderful baby. And because she was a demon, it was impossible for her to know that the Supreme Lord, even though playing the part of a baby, was no one less than the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. His value as the Supreme Lord did not diminish upon His becoming a baby to please His devotee Ya\u015bod\u0101. The Lord may assume the form of a baby or a shape other than that of a human being, but it doesn\u2019t make the slightest difference; He is always the same Supreme. A living creature, however powerful he may become by dint of severe penance, can never become equal to the Supreme Lord. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a accepted the motherhood of P\u016btan\u0101 because she pretended to be an affectionate mother, allowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to suck her breast. The Lord accepts the least qualification of the living entity and awards him the highest reward. That is the standard of His character. Therefore, who but the Lord can be the ultimate shelter?"

Anyone who is slightly in touch with the Lord, somehow or other, is greatly benefited, even to the point of salvation, due to the excellence of the Lord. He is so kind that He awards salvation even to His enemies because they come into contact with Him and are indirectly absorbed in Him by their inimical thoughts. Actually, the demons can never be equal to the pure devotees, but Uddhava was thinking in that way because of his feelings of separation. He was thinking that at the last stage of his life he might not be able to see the Lord face to face as did the demons. The fact is that the devotees who are always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord in transcendental love are rewarded many hundreds and thousands of times more than the demons by being elevated to the spiritual planets, where they remain with the Lord in eternal, blissful existence. The demons and impersonalists are awarded the facility of merging in the brahmajyoti effulgence of the Lord, whereas the devotees are admitted into the spiritual planets. For comparison, one can just imagine the difference between floating in space and residing in one of the planets in the sky. The pleasure of the living entities on the planets is greater than that of those who have no body and who merge with the molecules of the sun\u2019s rays. The impersonalists, therefore, are no more favored than the enemies of the Lord; rather, they are both on the same level of spiritual salvation."

Vasudeva\u2019s thought of protecting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the wrath of Ka\u1e41sa is part of a transcendental relationship. The Lord enjoys more when someone takes Him as his subordinate son who needs the protection of a father than He does when someone accepts Him as the Supreme Lord. He is the father of everyone, and He protects everyone, but when His devotee takes it for granted that the Lord is to be protected by the devotee\u2019s care, it is a transcendental joy for the Lord. Thus when Vasudeva, out of fear of Ka\u1e41sa, carried Him to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the Lord enjoyed it; otherwise, He had no fear from Ka\u1e41sa or anyone else."

        "translation": "In His childhood, the Almighty Lord was surrounded by cowherd boys and calves, and thus He traveled on the shore of the Yamun\u0101 river, through gardens densely covered with trees and filled with vibrations of chirping birds.",
        "purport": " Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a landholder for King Ka\u1e41sa, but because by caste he was a vai\u015bya, a member of the mercantile and agricultural community, he maintained thousands of cows. It is the duty of the vai\u015byas to give protection to the cows, just as the k\u1e63atriyas are to give protection to the human beings. Because the Lord was a child, He was put in charge of the calves with His cowherd boyfriends. These cowherd boys were great \u1e5b\u1e63is and yog\u012bs in their previous births, and after many such pious births, they gained the association of the Lord and could play with Him on equal terms. Such cowherd boys never cared to know who K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was, but they played with Him as a most intimate and lovable friend. They were so fond of the Lord that at night they would only think of the next morning when they would be able to meet the Lord and go together to the forests for cowherding. The forests on the shore of the Yamun\u0101 are all beautiful gardens full of trees of mango, jackfruit, apples, guava, oranges, grapes, berries, palmfruit and so many other plants and fragrant flowers. And because the forest was on the bank of the Yamun\u0101, naturally there were ducks, cranes and peacocks on the branches of the trees. All these trees and birds and beasts were pious living entities born in the transcendental abode of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana just to give pleasure to the Lord and His eternal associates, the cowherd boys. While playing like a small child with His associates, the Lord killed many demons, including Agh\u0101sura, Bak\u0101sura, Pralamb\u0101sura and Gardabh\u0101sura. Although He appeared at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana just as a boy, He was actually like the covered flames of a fire. As a small particle of fire can kindle a great fire with fuel, so the Lord killed all these great demons, beginning from His babyhood in the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. The land of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the Lord\u2019s childhood playground, still remains today, and anyone who visits these places enjoys the same transcendental bliss, although the Lord is not physically visible to our imperfect eyes. Lord Caitanya recommended this land of the Lord as identical with the Lord and therefore worshipable by the devotees. This instruction is taken up especially by the followers of Lord Caitanya known as the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. And because the land is identical with the Lord, devotees like Uddhava and Vidura visited these places five thousand years ago in order to have direct contact with the Lord, visible or not visible. Thousands of devotees of the Lord are still wandering in these sacred places of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and all of them are preparing themselves to go back home, back to Godhead."

A child may insist on having something and cry like anything to get it, disturbing the whole neighborhood, and then immediately after achieving the desired thing, he laughs. Such crying and laughing is enjoyable to the parents and elderly members of the family, so the Lord would simultaneously cry and laugh in this way and merge His devotee parents in the humor of transcendental pleasure. These incidents are enjoyable only by the residents of Vraja like Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and not by the impersonalist worshipers of Brahman or Param\u0101tm\u0101. Sometimes when attacked in the forest by demons, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would appear struck with wonder, but He looked on them like the cub of a lion and killed them. His childhood companions would also be struck with wonder, and when they came back home they would narrate the story to their parents, and everyone would appreciate the qualities of their K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not belong only to His parents, Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101; He was the son of all the elderly inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and the friend of all contemporary boys and girls. Everyone loved K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He was the life and soul of everyone, including the animals, the cows and the calves."

        "translation": "While herding the very beautiful bulls, the Lord, who was the reservoir of all opulence and fortune, used to blow His flute, and thus He enlivened His faithful followers, the cowherd boys.",
        "purport": " As He grew to six and seven years old, the Lord was given charge of looking after the cows and bulls in the grazing grounds. He was the son of a well-to-do landholder who owned hundreds and thousands of cows, and according to Vedic economics, one is considered to be a rich man by the strength of his store of grains and cows. With only these two things, cows and grain, humanity can solve its eating problem. Human society needs only sufficient grain and sufficient cows to solve its economic problems. All other things but these two are artificial necessities created by man to kill his valuable life at the human level and waste his time in things which are not needed. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the teacher of human society, personally showed by His acts that the mercantile community, or the vai\u015byas, should herd cows and bulls and thus give protection to the valuable animals. According to sm\u1e5bti regulation, the cow is the mother and the bull the father of the human being. The cow is the mother because just as one sucks the breast of one\u2019s mother, human society takes cow\u2019s milk. Similarly, the bull is the father of human society because the father earns for the children just as the bull tills the ground to produce food grains. Human society will kill its spirit of life by killing the father and the mother. It is mentioned herein that the beautiful cows and bulls were of various checkered colors \u2014 red, black, green, yellow, ash, etc. And because of their colors and healthy smiling features, the atmosphere was enlivening. Over and above all, the Lord used to play His celebrated flute. The sound vibrated by His flute would give His friends such transcendental pleasure that they would forget all the talks of brahm\u0101nanda, which is so praised by the impersonalists. These cowherd boys, as will be explained by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, were living entities who had accumulated heaps of pious acts and thus were enjoying with the Lord in person and were hearing His transcendental flute. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.30) confirms the Lord\u2019s blowing His transcendental flute: Brahm\u0101j\u012b said, \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who plays on His transcendental flute. His eyes are like lotus flowers, He is decorated with peacock plumes, and His bodily color resembles a fresh black cloud, although His bodily features are more beautiful than millions of cupids.\u201d These are the special features of the Lord."

        "purport": " The atheist Ka\u1e41sa wanted to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a just after His birth. He failed to do so, but later on he got information that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was living in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana at the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. He therefore engaged many wizards who could perform wonderful acts and assume any form they liked. All of them appeared before the child-Lord in various forms, like Agha, Baka, P\u016btan\u0101, \u015aaka\u1e6da, T\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101varta, Dhenuka and Gardabha, and they tried to kill the Lord at every opportunity. But one after another, all of them were killed by the Lord as if He were only playing with dolls. Children play with toy lions, elephants, boars and many similar dolls, which are broken by the children in the course of their playing with them. Before the Almighty Lord, any powerful living being is just like a toy lion in the hands of a playing child. No one can excel God in any capacity, and therefore no one can be equal to or greater than Him, nor can anyone attain the stage of equality with God by any kind of endeavor. J\u00f1\u0101na, yoga and bhakti are three recognized processes of spiritual realization. The perfection of such processes can lead one to the desired goal of life in spiritual value, but that does not mean that one can attain a perfection equal to the Lord\u2019s by such endeavors. The Lord is the Lord at every stage. When He was playing just like a child on the lap of His mother Ya\u015bod\u0101may\u012b or just like a cowherd boy with His transcendental friends, He continued to remain God, without the slightest diminution of His six opulences. Thus He is always unrivaled."

        "translation": "The Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, desired to utilize the opulent financial strength of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda for worship of the cows, and also He wanted to give a lesson to Indra, the King of heaven. Thus He advised His father to perform worship of go, or the pasturing land and the cows, with the help of learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as.",
        "purport": " Since He is the teacher of everyone, the Lord also taught His father, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a well-to-do landholder and owner of many cows, and, as was the custom, he used to perform yearly worship of Indra, the King of heaven, with great opulence. This worship of demigods by the general populace is also advised in the Vedic literature just so people can accept the superior power of the Lord. The demigods are servants of the Lord deputed to look after the management of various activities of universal affairs. Therefore it is advised in the Vedic scriptures that one should perform yaj\u00f1as to appease the demigods. But one who is devoted to the Supreme Lord has no need to appease the demigods. Worship of the demigods by common people is an arrangement for acknowledging the supremacy of the Supreme Lord, but it is not necessary. Such appeasement is generally recommended for material gains only. As we have already discussed in the Second Canto of this literature, one who admits the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not need to worship the secondary demigods. Sometimes, being worshiped and adored by less intelligent living beings, the demigods become puffed up with power and forget the supremacy of the Lord. This happened when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present in the universe, and thus the Lord wanted to give a lesson to the King of heaven, Indra. He therefore asked Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda to stop the sacrifice offered to Indra and to use the money properly by performing a ceremony worshiping the cows and the pasturing ground on the hill of Govardhana. By this act Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a taught human society, as He has instructed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also, that one should worship the Supreme Lord by all acts and by all their results. That will bring about the desired success. The vai\u015byas are specifically advised to give protection to the cows and their pasturing ground or agricultural land instead of squandering their hard-earned money. That will satisfy the Lord. The perfection of one\u2019s occupational duty, whether in the sphere of duty to oneself, one\u2019s community or one\u2019s nation, is judged by the degree to which the Lord is satisfied."
