Still the foolish materialists cannot understand that they are simply wasting time in producing material necessities, which are destined to be vanquished in due course of time. This waste of energy is due to the ignorance of the mass of people, who do not know that they are eternal and that they have an eternal engagement also. They do not know that this span of life in a particular type of body is but a flash in the eternal journey.

The family we maintain is created by m\u0101y\u0101; it is the perverted reflection of the family in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka there are also family, friends, society, father and mother; everything is there, but they are eternal. Here, as we change bodies, our family relationships also change. Sometimes we are in a family of human beings, sometimes in a family of demigods, sometimes a family of cats, or sometimes a family of dogs. Family, society and friendship are flickering, and so they are called asat. It is said that as long as we are attached to this asat, temporary, nonexisting society and family, we are always full of anxieties. The materialists do not know that the family, society and friendship here in this material world are only shadows, and thus they become attached. Naturally their hearts are always burning, but in spite of all inconvenience, they still work to maintain such false families because they have no information of the real family association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "purport": " Family life within the kingdom of illusory energy, m\u0101y\u0101, is just like a prison for the eternal living entity. In prison a prisoner is shackled by iron chains and iron bars. Similarly, a conditioned soul is shackled by the charming beauty of a woman, by her solitary embraces and talks of so-called love, and by the sweet words of his small children. Thus he forgets his real identity. In this verse the words str\u012b\u1e47\u0101m asat\u012bn\u0101m indicate that womanly love is just to agitate the mind of man. Actually, in the material world there is no love. Both the woman and the man are interested in their sense gratification. For sense gratification a woman creates an illusory love, and the man becomes enchanted by such false love and forgets his real duty. When there are children as the result of such a combination, the next attraction is to the sweet words of the children. The love of the woman at home and the talk of the children make one a secure prisoner, and thus he cannot leave his home. Such a person is termed, in Vedic language, a g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b, which means \u201cone whose center of attraction is home.\u201d G\u1e5bhastha refers to one who lives with family, wife and children, but whose real purpose of living is to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One is therefore advised to become a g\u1e5bhastha and not a g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b. The g\u1e5bhastha\u2019s concern is to get out of the family life created by illusion and enter into real family life with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas the g\u1e5bhamedhi\u2019s business is to repeatedly chain himself to so-called family life, in one life after another, and perpetually remain in the darkness of m\u0101y\u0101."

Here in this material world, happiness means successful counteraction to the effects of distress. The material world is so made that unless one becomes a clever diplomat, his life will be a failure. Not to speak of human society, even the society of lower animals, the birds and bees, cleverly manages its bodily demands of eating, sleeping and mating. Human society competes nationally or individually, and in the attempt to be successful the entire human society becomes full of diplomacy. We should always remember that in spite of all diplomacy and all intelligence in the struggle for our existence, everything will end in a second by the supreme will. Therefore, all our attempts to become happy in this material world are simply a delusion offered by m\u0101y\u0101."

        "purport": " There is a Bengali proverb, \u201cThe person for whom I have stolen accuses me of being a thief.\u201d The family members, for whom an attached person acts in so many criminal ways, are never satisfied. In illusion an attached person serves such family members, and by serving them he is destined to enter into a hellish condition of life. For example, a thief steals something to maintain his family, and he is caught and imprisoned. This is the sum and substance of material existence and attachment to material society, friendship and love. Although an attached family man is always engaged in getting money by hook or by crook for the maintenance of his family, he cannot enjoy more than what he could consume even without such criminal activities. A man who eats eight ounces of foodstuffs may have to maintain a big family and earn money by any means to support that family, but he himself is not offered more than what he can eat, and sometimes he eats the remnants that are left after his family members are fed. Even by earning money by unfair means, he cannot enjoy life for himself. That is called the covering illusion of m\u0101y\u0101. The process of illusory service to society, country and community is exactly the same everywhere; the same principle is applicable even to big national leaders. A national leader who is very great in serving his country is sometimes killed by his countrymen because of irregular service. In other words, one cannot satisfy his dependents by this illusory service, although one cannot get out of the service because servant is his constitutional position. A living entity is constitutionally part and parcel of the Supreme Being, but he forgets that he has to render service to the Supreme Being and diverts his attention to serving others; this is called m\u0101y\u0101. By serving others he falsely thinks that he is master. The head of a family thinks of himself as the master of the family, or the leader of a nation thinks of himself as the master of the nation, whereas actually he is serving, and by serving m\u0101y\u0101 he is gradually going to hell. Therefore, a sane man should come to the point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engage in the service of the Supreme Lord, applying his whole life, all of his wealth, his entire intelligence and his full power of speaking."

        "purport": " Not only in the present age but from time immemorial, no one has liked an old man who is unable to earn in the family. Even in the modern age, in some communities or states, the old men are given poison so that they will die as soon as possible. In some cannibalistic communities, the old grandfather is sportingly killed, and a feast is held in which his body is eaten. The example is given that a farmer does not like an old bull who has ceased to work. Similarly, when an attached person in family life becomes old and is unable to earn, he is no longer liked by his wife, sons, daughters and other kinsmen, and he is consequently neglected, what to speak of not being given respect. It is judicious, therefore, to give up family attachment before one attains old age and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should employ himself in the Lord\u2019s service so that the Supreme Lord can take charge of him and he will not be neglected by his so-called kinsmen."

The common man does not know the destiny of his life; he is simply busy in his flash of life, maintaining his family. At the last stage, no one is satisfied with how he has improved the family economic condition; everyone thinks that he could not provide sufficiently. Because of his deep family affection, he forgets his main duty of controlling the senses and improving his spiritual consciousness. Sometimes a dying man entrusts the family affairs to either his son or some relative, saying, \u201cI am going. Please look after the family.\u201d He does not know where he is going, but even at the time of death he is anxious about how his family will be maintained. Sometimes it is seen that a dying man requests the physician to increase his life at least for a few years so that the family maintenance plan which he has begun can be completed. These are the material diseases of the conditioned soul. He completely forgets his real engagement \u2014 to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious \u2014 and is always serious about planning to maintain his family, although he changes families one after another."

Here Lord Kapila describes how persons engaged in activities of sense gratification to maintain a family are treated by the messengers of Yamar\u0101ja, called Yamad\u016btas. At the time of death the Yamad\u016btas become the custodians of those persons who have strongly gratified their senses. They take charge of the dying man and take him to the planet where Yamar\u0101ja resides. The conditions there are described in the following verses."

In fact, it is not possible to kill a living entity because factually he is eternal; he simply has to suffer the consequences of his activities of sense gratification. The process of punishment is explained in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta. Formerly the king\u2019s men would take a criminal in a boat in the middle of the river. They would dunk him by grasping a bunch of his hair and thrusting him completely underwater, and when he was almost suffocated, the king\u2019s constables would take him out of the water and allow him to breathe for some time, and then they would again dunk him in the water to suffocate. This sort of punishment is inflicted upon the forgotten soul by Yamar\u0101ja, as will be described in the following verses."

Here the chance for recounting his activities of sense gratification is given by the dogs engaged by Yamar\u0101ja. While we live in the gross body, such activities of sense gratification are encouraged even by modern government regulations. In every state all over the world, such activities are encouraged by the government in the form of birth control. Women are supplied pills, and they are allowed to go to a clinical laboratory to get assistance for abortions. This is going on as a result of sense gratification. Actually sex life is meant for begetting a good child, but because people have no control over the senses and there is no institution to train them to control the senses, the poor fellows fall victim to the criminal offenses of sense gratification, and they are punished after death as described in these pages of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

But when sex life is indulged in for sense gratification illegally and illicitly, both the man and the woman await severe punishment in this world or after death. In this world also they are punished by virulent diseases like syphilis and gonorrhea, and in the next life, as we see in this passage of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, they are put into different kinds of hellish conditions to suffer. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, First Chapter, illicit sex life is also very much condemned, and it is said that one who produces children by illicit sex life is sent to hell. It is confirmed here in the Bh\u0101gavatam that such offenders are put into hellish conditions of life in T\u0101misra, Andha-t\u0101misra and Raurava."

For example, if a man is to be punished to remain in hell and eat stool and urine, then first of all he practices such habits on the planet of Yamar\u0101ja, and then he is given a particular type of body, that of a hog, so that he can eat stool and think that he is enjoying life.

        "purport": " When a man earns money by unfair means and maintains his family and himself with that money, the money is enjoyed by many members of the family, but he alone goes to hell. A person who enjoys life by earning money or by envying another\u2019s life, and who enjoys with family and friends, will have to enjoy alone the resultant sinful reactions accrued from such violent and illicit life. For example, if a man secures some money by killing someone and with that money maintains his family, those who enjoy the black money earned by him are also partially responsible and are also sent to hell, but he who is the leader is especially punished. The result of material enjoyment is that one takes with him the sinful reaction only, and not the money. The money he earned is left in this world, and he takes only the reaction. In this world also, if a person acquires some money by murdering someone, the family is not hanged, although its members are sinfully contaminated. But the man who commits the murder and maintains his family is himself hanged as a murderer. The direct offender is more responsible for sinful activities than the indirect enjoyer. The great learned scholar C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita says, therefore, that whatever one has in his possession had better be spent for the cause of sat, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because one cannot take his possessions with him. They remain here, and they will be lost. Either we leave the money or the money leaves us, but we will be separated. The best use of money as long as it is within our possession is to spend it to acquire K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " The example set herein is that the sinful person suffers just like a man who has lost his wealth. The human form of body is achieved by the conditioned soul after many, many births and is a very valuable asset. Instead of utilizing this life to get liberation, if one uses it simply for the purpose of maintaining his so-called family and therefore performs foolish and unauthorized action, he is compared to a man who has lost his wealth and who, upon losing it, laments. When wealth is lost, there is no use lamenting, but as long as there is wealth, one has to utilize it properly and thereby gain eternal profit. It may be argued that when a man leaves his money earned by sinful activities, he also leaves his sinful activities here with his money. But it is especially mentioned herein that by superior arrangement (daiven\u0101s\u0101ditam), although the man leaves behind him his sinfully earned money, he carries the effect of it. When a man steals some money, if he is caught and agrees to return it, he is not freed from the criminal punishment. By the law of the state, even though he returns the money, he has to undergo the punishment. Similarly, the money earned by a criminal process may be left by the man when dying, but by superior arrangement he carries with him the effect, and therefore he has to suffer hellish life."

        "purport": " Three words in this verse are very significant. Kevalena means \u201conly by black methods,\u201d adharme\u1e47a means \u201cunrighteous\u201d or \u201cirreligious,\u201d and ku\u1e6dumba-bhara\u1e47a means \u201cfamily maintenance.\u201d Maintaining one\u2019s family is certainly the duty of a householder, but one should be eager to earn his livelihood by the prescribed method, as stated in the scriptures. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is described that the Lord has divided the social system into four classifications of castes, or var\u1e47as, according to quality and work. Apart from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, in every society a man is known according to his quality and work. For example, when a man is constructing wooden furniture, he is called a carpenter, and a man who works with an anvil and iron is called a blacksmith. Similarly, a man who is engaged in the medical or engineering fields has a particular duty and designation. All these human activities have been divided by the Supreme Lord into four var\u1e47as, namely br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and in other Vedic literatures, the specific duties of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra are mentioned. One should work honestly according to his qualification. He should not earn his livelihood unfairly, by means for which he is not qualified. If a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who works as a priest so that he may enlighten his followers with the spiritual way of life is not qualified as a priest, then he is cheating the public. One should not earn by such unfair means. The same is applicable to a k\u1e63atriya or to a vai\u015bya. It is especially mentioned that the means of livelihood of those who are trying to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness must be very fair and uncomplicated. Here it is mentioned that he who earns his livelihood by unfair means (kevalena) is sent to the darkest hellish region. Otherwise, if one maintains his family by prescribed methods and honest means, there is no objection to one\u2019s being a family man."

        "purport": " Just as a prisoner, who has undergone troublesome prison life, is set free again, the person who has always engaged in impious and mischievous activities is put into hellish conditions, and when he has undergone different hellish lives, namely those of lower animals like cats, dogs and hogs, by the gradual process of evolution he again comes back as a human being. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated that even though a person engaged in the practice of the yoga system may not finish perfectly and may fall down for some reason or other, his next life as a human being is guaranteed. It is stated that such a person, who has fallen from the path of yoga practice, is given a chance in his next life to take birth in a very rich family or in a very pious family. It is interpreted that \u201crich family\u201d refers to a big mercantile family because generally people who engage in trades and mercantile business are very rich. One who engaged in the process of self-realization, or connecting with the Supreme Absolute Truth, but fell short is allowed to take birth in such a rich family, or in the family of pious br\u0101hma\u1e47as; either way, he is guaranteed to appear in human society in his next life. It can be concluded that if someone is not willing to enter into hellish life, as in T\u0101misra or Andha-t\u0101misra, then he must take to the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is the first-class yoga system, because even if one is unable to attain complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in this life, he is guaranteed at least to take his next birth in a human family. He cannot be sent into a hellish condition. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the purest life, and it protects all human beings from gliding down to hell to take birth in a family of dogs or hogs."
