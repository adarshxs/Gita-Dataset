        "purport": " The demigods, who are denizens of higher planets, are also very much afraid of incidents such as the universe\u2019s becoming dark, and so they consulted Brahm\u0101. This indicates that the quality of fear exists for every living entity in the material world. The four principal activities of material existence are eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. The fear element exists also in the demigods. On every planet, even in the higher planetary systems, including the moon and the sun, as well as on this earth, the same principles of animal life exist. Otherwise, why are the demigods also afraid of the darkness? The difference between the demigods and ordinary human beings is that the demigods approach authority, whereas the inhabitants of this earth defy authority. If people would only approach the authority, then every adverse condition in this universe could be rectified. Arjuna was also disturbed on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, but he approached the authority, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and his problem was solved. The conclusive instruction of this incident is that we may be disturbed by some material condition, but if we approach the authority who can actually explain the matter, then our problem is solved. The demigods approached Brahm\u0101 for the meaning of the disturbance, and after hearing from him they were satisfied and returned home peacefully."

They did not know the secrets of these portents and thought that the dissolution of the universe was at hand.",
        "purport": " According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Seventh Chapter, the laws of nature are so stringent that it is impossible for the living entity to surpass their enforcement. It is also explained that only those who are fully surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can be saved. We can learn from the description of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that it is because of the birth of two great demons that there were so many natural disturbances. It is to be indirectly understood, as previously described, that when there are constant disturbances on the earth, that is an omen that some demoniac people have been born or that the demoniac population has increased. In former days there were only two demons \u2014 those born of Diti \u2014 yet there were so many disturbances. At the present day, especially in this Age of Kali, these disturbances are always visible, which indicates that the demoniac population has certainly increased. To check the increase of demoniac population, the Vedic civilization enacted so many rules and regulations of social life, the most important of which is the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na process for begetting good children. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Arjuna informed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that if there is unwanted population (var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara), the entire world will appear to be hell. People are very anxious for peace in the world, but there are so many unwanted children born without the benefit of the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na ceremony, just like the demons born from Diti. Diti was so lusty that she forced her husband to copulate at a time which was inauspicious, and therefore the demons were born to create disturbances. In having sex life to beget children, one should observe the process for begetting nice children; if each and every householder in every family observes the Vedic system, then there are nice children, not demons, and automatically there is peace in the world. If we do not follow regulations in life for social tranquillity, we cannot expect peace. Rather, we will have to undergo the stringent reactions of natural laws."
