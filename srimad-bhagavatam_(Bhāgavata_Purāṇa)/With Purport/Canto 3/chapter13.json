A pure devotee of the Lord cannot be separated from the lotus feet of the Lord for even a moment. Undoubtedly the Lord is always within the hearts of all living creatures, but they hardly know about it because they are deluded by the illusory material energy. The devotees, however, realize the presence of the Lord, and therefore they can always see the lotus feet of the Lord within their hearts. Such pure devotees of the Lord are as glorious as the Lord; they are, in fact, recommended by the Lord as more worshipable than He Himself. Worship of the devotee is more potent than worship of the Lord. It is therefore the duty of the transcendental students to hear of pure devotees, as explained by similar devotees of the Lord, because one cannot explain about the Lord or His devotee unless one happens to be a pure devotee himself."

The example of the father of mankind may be rigidly followed by mankind, and that will advance the cause of the relationship of fathers and sons."

That incident was not forgotten by Brahm\u0101, and therefore the obedience of Manu Sv\u0101yambhuva was very encouraging. From the material point of view, the four sages\u2019 disobedience to the order of their father was certainly abominable, but because such disobedience was for a higher purpose, they were free from the reaction of disobedience. Those who disobey their fathers on material grounds, however, are surely subjected to disciplinary reaction for such disobedience. Manu\u2019s obedience to his father on material grounds was certainly free from envy, and in the material world it is imperative for ordinary men to follow the example of Manu."

There is no alternative to pacifying the Lord by execution of the principles of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system.\u201d Vi\u1e63\u1e47u worship is the ultimate aim of human life.

Var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma is the systematic institution for advancing in worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

Similarly, all other kings on different planets of the universe are representatives of Manu. The lawbook for the entire human society is the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, which directs all activities towards the transcendental service of the Lord. Every king, therefore, must know that his responsibility in administration is not merely to exact taxes from the citizens but to see personally that the citizens under him are being trained in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u worship. Everyone must be educated in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u worship and engaged in the devotional service of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the owner of the senses. The conditioned souls are meant not to satisfy their material senses but to satisfy the senses of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the purpose of the complete administrative system. One who knows this secret, as disclosed here in the version of Brahm\u0101, is the perfect administrative head. One who does not know this is a show-bottle administrator. By training the citizens in the devotional service of the Lord, the head of a state can be free in his responsibility; otherwise he will fail in the onerous duty entrusted to him and thus be punishable by the supreme authority. There is no other alternative in the discharge of administrative duty."

The sound which He vibrated as the boar incarnation was answered by the Vedic hymns of the great sages in the planets Janaloka, Tapoloka and Satyaloka. The highest intellectual and pious living entities live in those planets, and when they heard the extraordinary voice of the boar, they could understand that the specific sound was vibrated by the Lord and no one else. Therefore they replied by praying to the Lord with Vedic hymns. The earth planet was submerged in the mire, but on hearing the sound of the Lord, the inhabitants of the higher planets were all jubilant because they knew that the Lord was there to deliver the earth. Therefore Brahm\u0101 and all the sages, such as Bh\u1e5bgu, Brahm\u0101\u2019s other sons, and learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as, were enlivened, and they concertedly joined in praising the Lord with the transcendental vibrations of the Vedic hymns.

The Vedas are said to be the breath of the Lord, and that breath was inhaled by Brahm\u0101, the original student of the Vedas. The breathing from the nostril of Brahm\u0101 caused the appearance of Lord Boar, and therefore the boar incarnation of the Lord is the personified Vedas.

He is never to be misunderstood to be other than the Supreme Lord because of His assuming the form of a boar to lift the earth. That is the clear understanding of sages and great personalities like Brahm\u0101 and other residents of the higher planetary systems."

For such condemned persons, the Lord\u2019s incarnation as the gigantic hog is invisible. These strict followers of the Vedas who despise the eternal forms of the Lord may know from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that such incarnations are personified forms of the Vedas. Lord Boar\u2019s skin, His eyes and His bodily hair holes are all described here as different parts of the Vedas.

They have recently made a rule in their group to formally observe daily sacrifice; they simply ignite a small fire and offer something whimsically, but they do not strictly follow the sacrificial rules and regulations mentioned in the Vedas. It is understood that by regulation there are different plates of sacrifice required, such as srak, sruv\u0101, barhis, c\u0101tur-hotra, i\u1e0d\u0101, camasa, pr\u0101\u015bitra, graha and agni-hotra. One cannot achieve the results of sacrifice unless one observes the strict regulations. In this age there is practically no facility for performing sacrifices in strict discipline. Therefore, in this Age of Kali there is a stricture regarding such sacrifices: it is explicitly directed that one should perform sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a and nothing more. The incarnation of the Supreme Lord is Yaj\u00f1e\u015bvara, and unless one has respect for the incarnation of the Lord, he cannot perfectly perform sacrifice. In other words, taking shelter of the Lord and rendering service unto Him is the factual performance of all sacrifices, as explained herein. Different plates of sacrifice correspond to the different parts of the body of the Lord\u2019s incarnation. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Eleventh Canto, it is explicitly directed that one should perform sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a to please the Lord\u2019s incarnation as \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. This should be rigidly followed in order to achieve the result of yaj\u00f1a performance."

We offer our respectful obeisances to You as the supreme spiritual master of knowledge in devotional service.",
        "purport": " The qualification of bhakti, or devotional service to the Lord, is that the devotee should be free from all material contaminations and desires. This freedom is called vair\u0101gya, or renouncement of material desires. One who engages in devotional service to the Lord according to regulative principles is automatically freed from material desires, and in that pure state of mind one can realize the Personality of Godhead. The Personality of Godhead, being situated in everyone\u2019s heart, instructs the devotee regarding pure devotional service so that he may ultimately achieve the association of the Lord. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10) as follows: \u201cTo one who constantly engages in the devotional service of the Lord with faith and love, the Lord certainly gives the intelligence to achieve Him at the ultimate end.\u201d One has to conquer the mind, and one may do it by following the Vedic rituals and by performing different types of sacrifice. The ultimate end of all those performances is to attain bhakti, or the devotional service of the Lord. Without bhakti one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The original Personality of Godhead or His innumerable expansions of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are the only objects of worship by all the Vedic rituals and sacrificial performances."

This conception of the Lord and the earth as father and mother is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.4). Conditioned souls are devoted to the motherland in which they take their birth, but they do not know their father. The mother is not independent in producing children.

        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10), the Lord gives intelligence to the pure devotees so that they may be elevated to the highest perfectional stage. It is confirmed herein that a pure devotee, who constantly engages in the loving service of the Lord, is awarded all knowledge necessary to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For such a devotee there is nothing valuable to be achieved but the Lord\u2019s service. If one serves faithfully, there is no possibility of frustration because the Lord Himself takes charge of the devotee\u2019s advancement. The Lord is seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and He knows the devotee\u2019s motive and arranges everything achievable. In other words, the pseudo devotee, who is anxious to achieve material gains, cannot attain the highest perfectional stage because the Lord is in knowledge of his motive. One merely has to become sincere in his purpose, and then the Lord is there to help in every way."

        "purport": " The narration of the activities of the Personality of Godhead is like a constant flow of nectar. No one can refuse to drink such nectar except one who is not a human being. Devotional service to the Lord is the highest goal of life for every human being, and such devotional service begins by hearing about the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead. Only an animal, or a man who is almost an animal in behavior, can refuse to take an interest in hearing the transcendental message of the Lord. There are many books of stories and histories in the world, but except for the histories or narrations on the topics of the Personality of Godhead, none are capable of diminishing the burden of material pangs. Therefore one who is serious about eliminating material existence must chant and hear of the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead. Otherwise one must be compared to the nonhumans."
