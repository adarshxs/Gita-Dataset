        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, commenting on this verse, states that although the demon wanted to deride the Personality of Godhead in the form of a boar, actually he worshiped Him in several words. For example, he addressed Him as vana-gocara\u1e25, which means \u201cone who is a resident of the forest,\u201d but another meaning of vana-gocara\u1e25 is \u201cone who lies on the water.\u201d Vi\u1e63\u1e47u lies on the water, so the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be properly addressed in this way. The demon also addressed Him as m\u1e5bga\u1e25, indicating, unintentionally, that the Supreme Personality is sought after by great sages, saintly persons and transcendentalists. He also addressed Him as aj\u00f1a. \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b says that j\u00f1a means \u201cknowledge,\u201d and there is no knowledge which is unknown to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indirectly, therefore, the demon said that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u knows everything. The demon addressed Him as sur\u0101dhama. Sura means \u201cthe demigods,\u201d and adhama means \u201cLord of all there is.\u201d He is Lord of all the demigods; therefore He is the best of all demigods, or God. When the demon used the phrase \u201cin my presence,\u201d the implied meaning was, \u201cIn spite of my presence, You are completely able to take away the earth.\u201d Na svasti y\u0101syasi: \u201cUnless You kindly take this earth from our custody, there can be no good fortune for us.\u201d"

The Lord kills the process of birth and death and keeps Himself invisible. The activities of the Lord\u2019s internal potency are inconceivable, but by a slight exhibition of this potency, the Lord, by His grace, can deliver one from nescience. \u015auca\u1e25 means \u201cmiseries\u201d; the miseries of material existence can be extinguished by the Lord by His internal potency, yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. In the Upani\u1e63ads (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.8) it is stated, par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate. The Lord is invisible to the eyes of the common man, but His energies act in various ways. When demons are in adversity, they think that God is hiding Himself and is working by His mystic potency. They think that if they can find God they can kill Him just by seeing Him. Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a thought that way, and he challenged the Lord: \u201cYou have done tremendous harm to our community, taking the part of the demigods, and You have killed our kinsmen in so many ways, always keeping Yourself hidden. Now I see You face to face, and I am not going to let You go. I shall kill You and save my kinsmen from Your mystic misdeeds.\u201d Not only are demons always anxious to kill God with words and philosophy, but they think that if one is materially powerful he can kill God with materially fatal weapons. Demons like Ka\u1e41sa, R\u0101va\u1e47a and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu thought themselves powerful enough to kill even God. Demons cannot understand that God, by His multifarious potencies, can work so wonderfully that He can be present everywhere and still remain in His eternal abode, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana."

        "translation": "The demon continued: When You fall dead with Your skull smashed by the mace hurled by my arms, the demigods and sages who offer You oblations and sacrifice in devotional service will also automatically cease to exist, like trees without roots.",
        "purport": " Demons are very much disturbed when devotees worship the Lord in the prescribed ways recommended in the scriptures. In the Vedic scriptures, the neophyte devotees are advised to engage in nine kinds of devotional service, such as to hear and chant the holy name of God, to remember Him always, to chant on beads Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, to worship the Lord in the form of His Deity incarnation in the temples, and to engage in various activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to increase the number of godly persons for perfect peace in the world. Demons do not like such activity. They are always envious of God and His devotees. Their propaganda not to worship in the temple or church but simply to make material advancement for satisfaction of the senses is always current. The demon Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a, upon seeing the Lord face to face, wanted to make a permanent solution by killing the Personality of Godhead with his powerful mace. The example of an uprooted tree mentioned here by the demon is very significant. Devotees accept that God is the root of everything. Their example is that just as the stomach is the source of energy of all the limbs of the body, God is the original source of all energy manifested in the material and spiritual worlds; therefore, as supplying food to the stomach is the process to satisfy all the limbs of the body, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or developing love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the sublime method for satisfying the source of all happiness. The demon wants to uproot this source because if the root, God, were to be checked, the activities of the Lord and the devotees would automatically stop. The demon would be very much satisfied by such a situation in society. Demons are always anxious to have a godless society for their sense gratification. According to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, this verse means that when the demon would be deprived of his mace by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not only the neophyte devotees but also the ancient sagacious devotees of the Lord would be very much satisfied."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is decried by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, who are almost demons. They say that God has no head, no form, no existence and no legs, hands or other bodily limbs. In other words, they say that He is dead or lame. All these misconceptions of the Supreme Lord are a source of dissatisfaction to Him; He is never pleased with such atheistic descriptions. In this case, although the Lord felt sorrow from the piercing words of the demon, He delivered the earth for the satisfaction of the demigods, who are ever His devotees. The conclusion is that God is as sentient as we are. He is satisfied by our prayers and dissatisfied by our harsh words against Him. In order to give protection to His devotee, He is always ready to tolerate insulting words from the atheists."

Therefore His toleration was displayed mainly to drive away the fears of the demigods, who should know that the Lord is always present to protect them. The demon\u2019s derision of the Lord was just like the barking of dogs; the Lord did not care about it, since He was doing His own work in delivering the earth from the midst of the water. Materialistic demons always possess large amounts of gold in various shapes, and they think that a large amount of gold, physical strength and popularity can save them from the wrath of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

The earth planet is also called go, or cow. As bulls fight between themselves to ascertain who will have union with a cow, there is always a constant fight between the demons and the Supreme Lord or His representative for supremacy over the earth. Here the Lord is significantly described as yaj\u00f1\u0101vayava. One should not consider the Lord to have the body of an ordinary boar. He can assume any form, and He possesses all such forms eternally. It is from Him that all other forms have emanated. This boar form is not to be considered the form of an ordinary hog; His body is actually full of yaj\u00f1a, or worshipful offerings. Yaj\u00f1a (sacrifices) are offered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Yaj\u00f1a means the body of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. His body is not material; therefore He should not be taken to be an ordinary boar. Brahm\u0101 is described in this verse as svar\u0101\u1e6d. Actually, full independence is exclusive to the Lord Himself, but as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, every living entity has a minute quantity of independence. Each and every one of the living entities within this universe has this minute independence, but Brahm\u0101, being the chief of all living entities, has a greater potential of independence than any other. He is the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and has been assigned to preside over universal affairs. All other demigods work for him; therefore he is described here as svar\u0101\u1e6d. He is always accompanied by great sages and transcendentalists, all of whom came to see the bullfight between the demon and the Lord."

        "purport": " There are two classes of living entities: one is called sura, or the demigods, and the other is called asura, or the demons. Demons are generally fond of worshiping the demigods, and there are evidences that by such worship they get extensive power for their sense gratification. This later proves to be a cause of trouble to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, demigods and other innocent living entities. Demons habitually find fault with the demigods, br\u0101hma\u1e47as and innocent, to whom they are a constant source of fear. The way of the demon is to take power from the demigods and then tease the demigods themselves. There is an instance of a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva who obtained a boon from Lord \u015aiva that the head of whomever he touched with his hand would come off its trunk. As soon as the boon was offered to him, the demon wanted to touch the very head of Lord \u015aiva. That is their way. The devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not, however, ask any favor for sense gratification. Even if they are offered liberation, they refuse it. They are happy simply engaging in the transcendental loving service of the Lord."
