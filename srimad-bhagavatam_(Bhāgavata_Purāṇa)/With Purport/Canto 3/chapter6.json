        "purport": " The ingredients of matter are counted as twenty-three: the total material energy, false ego, sound, touch, form, taste, smell, earth, water, fire, air, sky, eye, ear, nose, tongue, skin, hand, leg, evacuating organ, genitals, speech and mind. All are combined together by the influence of time and are again dissolved in the course of time. Time, therefore, is the energy of the Lord and acts in her own way by the direction of the Lord. This energy is called K\u0101l\u012b and is represented by the dark destructive goddess generally worshiped by persons influenced by the mode of darkness or ignorance in material existence. In the Vedic hymn this process is described as m\u016bla-prak\u1e5btir avik\u1e5btir mahad\u0101dy\u0101\u1e25 prak\u1e5bti-vik\u1e5btaya\u1e25 sapta \u1e63o\u1e0da\u015bakas tu vik\u0101ro na prak\u1e5btir na vik\u1e5bti\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e25. The energy which acts as material nature in a combination of twenty-three ingredients is not the final source of creation. The Lord enters into the elements and applies His energy, called K\u0101l\u012b. In all other Vedic scriptures the same principle is accepted. In Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.35) it is stated: \u201cI worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is the original Personality of Godhead. By His partial plenary expansion [Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u], He enters into material nature, and then into each and every universe [as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u], and then [as K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u] into all the elements, including every atom of matter. Such manifestations of cosmic creation are innumerable, both in the universes and in the individual atoms.\u201d Similarly, this is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.42): \u201cO Arjuna, there is no necessity of your knowing about My innumerable energies, which act in various ways. I enter into the material creation by My partial plenary expansion [Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supersoul] in all the universes and in all the elements thereof, and thus the work of creation goes on.\u201d The wonderful activities of material nature are due to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus He is the final cause, or the ultimate cause of all causes."

These individual living entities are conditioned souls everlastingly, but in each and every material creation they are given a chance to liberate themselves and become free souls. They are all given a chance to take advantage of the Vedic wisdom and find out what is their relationship with the Supreme Lord, how they can be liberated, and what the ultimate profit is in such liberation. By properly studying the Vedas one becomes conscious of his position and thus takes to the transcendental devotional service of the Lord and is gradually promoted to the spiritual sky. The individual souls in the material world engage in different activities according to their past unfinished desires. After the dissolution of a particular body, the individual soul forgets everything, but the all-merciful Lord, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart as the witness, the Supersoul, awakens him and reminds him of his past desires, and thus he begins to act accordingly in his next life. This unseen guidance is described as fate, and a sensible man can understand that this continues his material bondage in the three modes of nature. The unconscious sleeping stage of the living entity just after the partial or total dissolution of the creation is wrongly accepted as the final stage of life by some less intelligent philosophers. After the dissolution of the partial material body, a living entity remains unconscious for only a few months, and after the total dissolution of the material creation, he remains unconscious for many millions of years. But when the creation is again revived, he is awakened to his work by the Lord. The living entity is eternal, and the wakeful state of his consciousness, manifested by activities, is his natural condition of life. He cannot stop acting while awake, and thus he acts according to his diverse desires. When his desires are trained in the transcendental service of the Lord, his life becomes perfect, and he is promoted to the spiritual sky to enjoy eternal awakened life."

In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (Chapter Two) importance is given to the spiritual consciousness, not the body. The entire cosmic body increased by the same process that we experience in our small bodies.

        "purport": " Consciousness is the sign of the living entity, or the soul. The existence of the soul is manifest in the form of consciousness, called j\u00f1\u0101na-\u015bakti. The total consciousness is that of the gigantic vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa, and the same consciousness is exhibited in individual persons. The activity of consciousness is performed through the air of life, which is of ten divisions. The airs of life are called pr\u0101\u1e47a, ap\u0101na, ud\u0101na, vy\u0101na and sam\u0101na and are also differently qualified as n\u0101ga, k\u016brma, k\u1e5bkara, devadatta and dhana\u00f1jaya. The consciousness of the soul becomes polluted by the material atmosphere, and thus various activities are exhibited in the false ego of bodily identification. These various activities are described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.41) as bahu-\u015b\u0101kh\u0101 hy anant\u0101\u015b ca buddhayo\u00a0\u2019vyavas\u0101yin\u0101m. The conditioned soul is bewildered into various activities for want of pure consciousness. In pure consciousness the activity is one. The consciousness of the individual soul becomes one with the supreme consciousness when there is complete synthesis between the two. The monist believes that there is only one consciousness, whereas the s\u0101tvatas, or the devotees, believe that although there is undoubtedly one consciousness, they are one because there is agreement. The individual consciousness is advised to dovetail with the supreme consciousness, as instructed by the Lord in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. The individual consciousness (Arjuna) is advised to dovetail with the supreme consciousness and thus maintain his conscious purity. It is foolish to try to stop the activities of consciousness, but they can be purified when they are dovetailed with the Supreme. This consciousness is divided into three modes of self-identification according to the proportion of purity: \u0101dhy\u0101tmika, or self-identification with the body and mind, \u0101dhibhautika, or self-identification with the material products, and \u0101dhidaivika, or self-identification as a servant of the Lord. Of the three, \u0101dhidaivika self-identification is the beginning of purity of consciousness in pursuance of the desire of the Lord."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.4-5) it is stated that the eight elements earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego are all products of the Lord\u2019s inferior energy, whereas the living entities, who are seen to utilize the inferior energy, originally belong to the superior energy, the internal potency of the Lord. The eight inferior energies work grossly and subtly, whereas the superior energy works as the central generating force. This is experienced in the human body. The gross elements, namely earth, etc., form the external gross body and are like a coat, whereas the subtle mind and false ego act like the inner clothing of the body. The movements of the body are first generated from the heart, and all the activities of the body are made possible by the senses, powered by the ten kinds of air within the body. The ten kinds of air are described as follows: The main air passing through the nose in breathing is called pr\u0101\u1e47a. The air which passes through the rectum as evacuated bodily air is called ap\u0101na. The air which adjusts the foodstuff within the stomach and which sometimes sounds as belching is called sam\u0101na. The air which passes through the throat and the stoppage of which constitutes suffocation is called the ud\u0101na air. And the total air which circulates throughout the entire body is called the vy\u0101na air. Subtler than these five airs, there are others also. That which facilitates the opening of the eyes, mouth, etc., is called n\u0101ga air. The air which increases appetite is called k\u1e5bkara air. The air which helps contraction is called k\u016brma air. The air which helps relaxation by opening the mouth wide (in yawning) is called devadatta air, and the air which helps sustenance is called dhana\u00f1jaya air. All these airs are generated from the center of the heart, which is one only. This central energy is superior energy of the Lord, who is seated within the heart with the soul of the body, who acts under the guidance of the Lord. This is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15) as follows: The complete central force is generated from the heart by the Lord, who is seated there and who helps the conditioned soul in remembering and forgetting. The conditioned state is due to the soul\u2019s forgetfulness of his relationship of subordination to the Lord. One who wants to continue to forget the Lord is helped by the Lord to forget Him birth after birth, but one who remembers Him, by dint of association with a devotee of the Lord, is helped to remember Him more and more. Thus the conditioned soul can ultimately go back home, back to Godhead. This process of transcendental help by the Lord is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10) as follows: The buddhi-yoga process of self-realization with intelligence transcendental to the mind (devotional service) can alone elevate one from the conditioned state of material entanglement in the cosmic construction. The conditioned state of the living entity is like that of a person who is within the depths of a huge mechanical arrangement. The mental speculators can reach the point of buddhi-yoga after many, many lifetimes of speculation, but the intelligent person who begins from the platform of intelligence above the mind makes rapid progress in self-realization. Because the buddhi-yoga process entails no fear of deterioration or retrogression at any time, it is the guaranteed path to self-realization, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.40). The mental speculators cannot understand that the two birds (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad) sitting in one tree are the soul and the Supersoul. The individual soul eats the fruit of the tree, while the other bird does not eat the fruit but only observes the activities of the eating bird. Without attachment, the witnessing bird helps the fruit-eating bird perform fruitful activities. One who cannot understand this difference between the soul and the Supersoul, or God and the living entities, is certainly still in the entanglement of the cosmic machinery and thus must still await the time when he will be free from bondage."

        "purport": " The impersonalists are captivated by the gigantic universal form of the Supreme. They think that the control behind this gigantic manifestation is an imagination. Intelligent persons, however, can estimate the value of the cause by observing the wonders of the effects. For example, the individual human body does not develop from the womb of the mother independently but because the living entity, the soul, is within the body. Without the living entity, a material body cannot automatically take shape or develop. When any material object displays development, it must be understood that there is a spiritual soul within the manifestation. The gigantic universe has developed gradually, just as the body of a child develops. The conception that the Transcendence enters within the universe is, therefore, logical. As the materialists cannot find the soul and the Supersoul within the heart, similarly, for want of sufficient knowledge, they cannot see that the Supreme Soul is the cause of the universe. The Lord is therefore described in the Vedic language as av\u0101\u1e45-m\u0101nasa-gocara\u1e25, beyond the conception of words and minds. Due to a poor fund of knowledge, the mental speculators try to bring the Supreme within the purview of words and minds, but the Lord refuses to be so intelligible; the speculator has no adequate words or mind to gauge the infinity of the Lord. The Lord is called adhok\u1e63aja, or the person who is beyond perception by the blunt, limited potency of our senses. One cannot perceive the transcendental name or form of the Lord by mental speculation. The mundane Ph.D.\u2019s are completely unable to speculate on the Supreme with their limited senses. Such attempts by the puffed up Ph.D\u2019s are compared to the philosophy of the frog in the well. A frog in a well was informed of the gigantic Pacific Ocean, and he began to puff himself up in order to understand or measure the length and breadth of the Pacific Ocean. Ultimately the frog burst and died. The title Ph.D. can also be interpreted as Plough Department, a title meant for the tillers in the paddy field. The attempt of the tillers in the paddy field to understand the cosmic manifestation and the cause behind such wonderful work can be compared to the endeavor of the frog in the well to calculate the measurement of the Pacific Ocean. The Lord can reveal Himself only to a person who is submissive and who engages in His transcendental loving service. The demigods controlling the elements and ingredients of universal affairs prayed to the Lord for guidance, and thus He manifested His gigantic form, as He did at the request of Arjuna."

The word \u0101tyantikena is very significant in this verse. By development of the mode of goodness of material nature one can become situated in the heavenly planets. But by excessive development of the modes of passion and ignorance, the human being indulges in killing the animals who are meant to be protected by mankind. Persons who indulge in unnecessary animal killing have excessively developed in the modes of passion and ignorance and have no hope of advancing to the mode of goodness; they are destined to be degraded to lower statuses of life. The planetary systems are calculated as upper and lower in terms of the classes of living entities who live there."

Those who are inclined to this Vedic knowledge are called br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and they are the natural teachers and spiritual masters of all the orders of society.",
        "purport": " As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13), the four orders of human society developed with the order of the body of the gigantic form. The bodily divisions are the mouth, arms, waist and legs. Those who are situated on the mouth are called br\u0101hma\u1e47as, those who are situated on the arms are called k\u1e63atriyas, those who are situated on the waist are called vai\u015byas, and those who are situated on the legs are called \u015b\u016bdras. Everyone is situated in the body of the Supreme in His gigantic vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa form. In terms of the four orders, therefore, no caste is to be considered degraded because of being situated on a particular part of the body. In our own bodies we do not show any actual difference in our treatment towards the hands or legs. Each and every part of the body is important, although the mouth is the most important of the bodily parts. If other parts are cut off from the body, a man can continue his life, but if the mouth is cut off, one cannot live. Therefore, this most important part of the body of the Lord is called the sitting place of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who are inclined to the Vedic wisdom. One who is not inclined to the Vedic wisdom but to mundane affairs cannot be called a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, even if he is born of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family or father. To have a br\u0101hma\u1e47a father does not qualify one as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The main qualification of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is to be inclined to the Vedic wisdom. The Vedas are situated on the mouth of the Lord, and therefore anyone who is inclined to the Vedic wisdom is certainly situated on the mouth of the Lord, and he is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. This inclination towards Vedic wisdom is also not restricted to any particular caste or community. Anyone from any family and from any part of the world may become inclined to the Vedic wisdom, and that will qualify him as a real br\u0101hma\u1e47a. A real br\u0101hma\u1e47a is the natural teacher or spiritual master. Unless one has Vedic knowledge, one cannot become a spiritual master. The perfect knowledge of the Vedas is to know the Lord, the Personality of Godhead, and that is the end of Vedic knowledge, or Ved\u0101nta. One who is situated in the impersonal Brahman and has no information of the Supreme Personality of Godhead may become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, but he cannot become a spiritual master. It is said in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: An impersonalist can become a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a, but he cannot become a spiritual master unless and until he is promoted to the stage of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or a devotee of the Personality of Godhead. Lord Caitanya, the great authority of Vedic wisdom in the modern age, stated: A person may be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or a \u015b\u016bdra or a sanny\u0101s\u012b, but if he happens to be well versed in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then he is fit to become a spiritual master. (Cc. Madhya 8.128) The qualification, then, of a spiritual master is not to be a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a, but to be well versed in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who is conversant with Vedic wisdom is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. And only a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who is a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and knows all the intricacies of the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can become a spiritual master."

A person who follows the k\u1e63atriya principles by protecting society from thieves and miscreants is called a k\u1e63atriya, not the one who is simply born a k\u1e63atriya. The conception of the caste system is always based on quality and not on the qualification of birth. Birth is an extraneous consideration; it is not the main feature of the orders and divisions. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.41-44) the qualifications of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras are specifically mentioned, and it is understood that all such qualifications are needed before one can be designated as belonging to a particular group. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is always mentioned as the puru\u1e63a in all Vedic scriptures. Sometimes the living entities are also mentioned as puru\u1e63as, although they are essentially puru\u1e63a-\u015bakti (par\u0101 \u015bakti or par\u0101 prak\u1e5bti), the superior energy of the puru\u1e63a. Illusioned by the external potency of the puru\u1e63a (the Lord), the living entities falsely think of themselves as the puru\u1e63a although they actually have no qualifications. The Lord has the power to protect. Of the three deities Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Mahe\u015bvara, the first has the power to create, the second has the power to protect, and the third has the power to destroy. The word puru\u1e63a is significant in this verse because the k\u1e63atriyas are expected to represent the puru\u1e63a Lord in giving protection to the praj\u0101s, or all those who are born in the land and water. Protection is therefore meant for both man and the animals. In modern society the praj\u0101s are not protected from the hands of thieves and miscreants. The modern democratic state, which has no k\u1e63atriyas, is a government of the vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras, and not of br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas as formerly. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and his grandson, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, were typical k\u1e63atriya kings, for they gave protection to all men and animals. When the personification of Kali attempted to kill a cow, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it at once prepared himself to kill the miscreant, and the personification of Kali was banished from his kingdom. That is the sign of puru\u1e63a, or the representative of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. According to Vedic civilization, a qualified k\u1e63atriya monarch is given the respect of the Lord because he represents the Lord by giving protection to the praj\u0101s. Modern elected presidents cannot even give protection from theft cases, and therefore one has to take protection from an insurance company. The problems of modern human society are due to the lack of qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas and the overinfluence of the vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras by so-called general franchise."

        "purport": " Human society\u2019s means of living is clearly mentioned here as vi\u015ba, or agriculture and the business of distributing agricultural products, which involves transport, banking, etc. Industry is an artificial means of livelihood, and large-scale industry especially is the source of all the problems of society. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also the duties of the vai\u015byas, who are engaged in vi\u015ba, are stated as cow protection, agriculture and business. We have already discussed that the human being can safely depend on the cow and agricultural land for his livelihood. The exchange of produce by banking and transportation is a branch of this type of living. The vai\u015byas are divided into many subsections: some of them are called k\u1e63etr\u012b, or landowners, some are called k\u1e5b\u1e63a\u1e47a, or land tillers, some of them are called tila-va\u1e47ik, or grain raisers, some are called gandha-va\u1e47ik, or merchants in spices, and some are called suvar\u1e47a-va\u1e47ik, or merchants in gold and banking. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the teachers and spiritual masters, the k\u1e63atriyas protect the citizens from the hands of thieves and miscreants, and the vai\u015byas are in charge of production and distribution. The \u015b\u016bdras, the unintelligent class of men who cannot act independently in any of the above-mentioned activities, are meant for serving the three higher classes for their livelihood. Formerly, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were given all the necessities of life by the k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas because they had no time to spend making a living. The k\u1e63atriyas would collect taxes from the vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras, but the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were exempt from paying income tax or land revenue. That system of human society was so nice that there were no political, social and economic upheavals. The different castes, or var\u1e47a classifications, are therefore essential for maintaining a peaceful human society."

        "purport": " Service is the real constitutional occupation of all living entities. The living entities are meant to render service to the Lord, and they can attain religious perfection by this service attitude. One cannot attain religious perfection simply by speculating to attain theoretical knowledge. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b division of spiritualists go on speculating only to distinguish the soul from matter, but they have no information of the activities of the soul after being liberated by knowledge. It is said that persons who only mentally speculate to know things as they are and who do not engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are simply wasting their time. It is clearly said here that the principle of service was generated from the legs of the Lord for the sake of perfecting the religious process, but this transcendental service is different from the idea of service in the material world. In the material world, no one wants to be a servant; everyone wants to become the master because false mastership is the basic disease of the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul in the material world wants to lord it over others. Illusioned by the external energy of the Lord, he is forced to become a servant of the material world. That is the real position of the conditioned soul. The last snare of the illusory, external energy is the conception of becoming one with the Lord, and due to this conception the illusioned soul remains in the bondage of material energy, falsely thinking himself a liberated soul and \u201cas good as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\u201d It is actually better to be a \u015b\u016bdra than to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and not develop the service attitude, because that attitude alone satisfies the Lord. Every living being \u2014 even if he be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by qualification \u2014 must take to the transcendental service of the Lord. Both Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam support that this service attitude is the perfection of the living entity. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra can perfect his occupational duties only by rendering service unto the Lord. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is supposed to know this fact due to his perfection in Vedic wisdom. The other sections are supposed to follow the direction of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava (one who is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by qualification and a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava by action). That will make the entire society perfect in regard to the order of its social construction. A disordered society cannot satisfy either the members of the society or the Lord. Even if one is not a perfect br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra but takes to the service of the Lord, not caring for the perfection of his social position, he becomes a perfect human being simply by developing the attitude of service to the Supreme Lord."

        "translation": "All these different social divisions are born, with their occupational duties and living conditions, from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus for unconditional life and self-realization one has to worship the Supreme Lord under the direction of the spiritual master.",
        "purport": " Since they are born from different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord in His gigantic form, all living entities in all parts of the entire universe are supposed to be eternal servitors of the supreme body. Every part of our own body, such as the mouth, hands, thighs and legs, is meant to render service to the whole. That is their constitutional position. In subhuman life the living entities are not conscious of this constitutional position, but in the human form of life they are supposed to know this through the system of the var\u1e47as, the social orders. As above mentioned, the br\u0101hma\u1e47a is the spiritual master of all the orders of society, and thus brahminical culture, culminating in the transcendental service of the Lord, is the basic principle for purifying the soul. In conditioned life the soul is under the impression that he can become the lord of the universe, and the last point of this misconception is to think oneself the Supreme. The foolish conditioned soul does not take into account that the Supreme cannot be conditioned by m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion. If the Supreme were to become conditioned by illusion, where would be His supremacy? In that case, m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, would be the Supreme. Therefore, because the living entities are conditioned, they cannot be supreme. The actual position of the conditioned soul is explained in this verse: all the conditioned souls are impure due to contact with the material energy in three modes of nature. Therefore it is necessary that they purify themselves under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, who not only is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by qualification but must also be a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. The only self-purifying process mentioned herein is to worship the Lord under the recognized method \u2014 under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master. That is the natural way of purification, and no other method is recommended as bona fide. The other methods of purification may be helpful to come to this stage of life, but ultimately one has to come to this last point before he attains actual perfection. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19) confirms this truth as follows:"

In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (11.16) Arjuna, the recognized devotee of the Lord, says: \u201cO my Lord, O gigantic vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa form, O master of the universe, I see innumerable hands, bodies, mouths and eyes in all directions, and they are all unlimited. I cannot find the end of this manifestation, nor do I see the middle, nor the beginning.\u201d Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was specifically spoken to Arjuna, and the vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa was exhibited before him at his request. He was awarded the specific eyes to see this vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, yet although he was able to see the Lord\u2019s innumerable hands and mouths, he was unable to see Him completely. Since Arjuna was unable to estimate the length and breadth of the potency of the Lord, who else would be able to do so? One may only indulge in miscalculation like the frog-philosopher. The frog-philosopher wanted to estimate the length and breadth of the Pacific Ocean by his experience of a well three cubic feet large, and thus he began to puff himself up to become as big as the Pacific Ocean, but at last he burst and died by this process. This story is applicable to the mental philosophers who, under the illusion of the Lord\u2019s external energy, indulge in estimating the length and breadth of the Supreme Lord. The best path is to become a cool-headed, submissive devotee of the Lord, try to hear about the Lord from the bona fide spiritual master, and thus serve the Lord in transcendental loving service, as suggested in the previous verse."

        "purport": " The purification of the conditioned soul necessitates purification of his consciousness. By the presence of consciousness, the presence of the transcendental soul is verified, and as soon as consciousness leaves the body, the material body is not active. Consciousness is perceived, therefore, by activities. The theory put forward by empiric philosophers that consciousness can remain in an inactive state is the proof of their poor fund of knowledge. One should not become unchaste by stopping the activities of pure consciousness. If the activities of pure consciousness are stopped, certainly the conscious living force will be otherwise engaged because unless engaged the consciousness has no standing. Consciousness cannot be silent, even for a moment. When the body does not act, the consciousness acts in the form of dreams. Unconsciousness is artificial; by induced extraneous help it remains for a limited period, but when the intoxication of the drug is finished or when one is awake, the consciousness again acts earnestly. Maitreya\u2019s statement is that in order to avoid unchaste conscious activities, he was trying to describe the unlimited glories of the Lord, although he did not have the ability to describe them perfectly. This glorification of the Lord is not a product of research, but the result of hearing submissively from the authority of the spiritual master. It is also not possible to repeat all that one has heard from his spiritual master, but one can narrate as far as possible by one\u2019s honest endeavor. It does not matter whether the Lord\u2019s glories are fully explained or not. One must attempt to engage one\u2019s bodily, mental and verbal activities in the transcendental glorification of the Lord; otherwise such activities will remain unchaste and impure. The existence of the conditioned soul can be purified only by the method of engaging mind and speech in the service of the Lord. The trida\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012b of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava school accepts three rods, representing the vow to engage in the service of the Lord with body, mind and speech, whereas the ekada\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012b takes the vow to become one with the Supreme. Since the Lord is the Absolute, there is no distinction between Him and His glories. The glories of the Lord as chanted by the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012b are as substantial as the Lord Himself, and thus while glorifying the Lord the devotee becomes one with Him in transcendental interest, although he remains eternally a transcendental servitor. This simultaneously one and different position of the devotee makes him eternally purified, and thus his life becomes a complete success."

But the idea of happiness indicated in this verse is different because it relates to the activities of the Supreme Personality, who has transcendental qualities. The word gu\u1e47a-v\u0101dam is significant because the qualities of the Lord and His activities and pastimes are the subject matter for the discussions of devotees. A \u1e5b\u1e63i like Maitreya is certainly not interested in discussing anything pertaining to mundane qualities, yet he says that the highest perfectional stage of transcendental realization is to discuss the Lord\u2019s activities. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, therefore, concludes that topics regarding the transcendental activities of the Lord are far beyond the transcendental realization of kaivalya happiness.

        "purport": " There are some froggish philosophers who want to know the Supreme Soul by means of philosophy and mental speculation. And when the devotees, who are to some extent in knowledge of the Supreme Lord, admit that the glories of the Lord are inestimable or inconceivable, the froggish philosophers adversely criticize them. These philosophers, like the frog in the well who tried to estimate the measurement of the Pacific Ocean, like to take trouble over fruitless mental speculation instead of taking instructions from devotees like the original poet, namely Brahm\u0101. Lord Brahm\u0101 underwent a severe type of meditation for one thousand celestial years, yet he said that the glories of the Lord are inconceivable. Therefore what can the froggish philosophers hope to gain from their mental speculations? It is said in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 that the mental speculator may fly through the sky of speculation with the velocity of the mind or the wind for thousands of millions of years, and still he will find it inconceivable. The devotees, however, do not waste time in such vain searching after knowledge of the Supreme, but they submissively hear the glories of the Lord from bona fide devotees. Thus they transcendentally enjoy the process of hearing and chanting. The Lord approves of the devotional activities of the devotees or mah\u0101tm\u0101s, and He says: The pure devotees of the Lord take shelter of the par\u0101 prak\u1e5bti, the internal potency of the Lord called Lak\u1e63m\u012bdev\u012b, S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b or \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Rukmi\u1e47\u012bdev\u012b, and thus they become actual mah\u0101tm\u0101s, or great souls. Mah\u0101tm\u0101s are not fond of indulging in mental speculations, but they actually take to the devotional service of the Lord, without the slightest deviation. Devotional service is manifested by the primary process of hearing and chanting about the activities of the Lord. This transcendental method practiced by the mah\u0101tm\u0101s gives them sufficient knowledge of the Lord because if the Lord can at all be known to some extent, it is only through the means of devotional service and no other way. One may go on speculating and waste the valuable time of his human life, but that will not help anyone to enter into the precincts of the Lord. The mah\u0101tm\u0101s, however, are not concerned with knowing the Lord by mental speculation because they enjoy hearing about His glorious activities in His transcendental dealings with His devotees or with the demons. The devotees take pleasure in both and are happy in this life and the life after."

The most wonderful puzzle for the mundane wranglers is that while they remain calculating the length and breadth of the unlimited potency of the Supreme Person, His faithful devotees are set free from the bondage of material encagement simply by appreciating the wonderful jugglery of the Supreme in the practical field. The devotees of the Lord see the wonderful dexterity in everything with which they come in contact in all circumstances of eating, sleeping, working, etc. A small banyan fruit contains thousands of small seeds, and each seed holds the potency of another tree, which again holds the potency of many millions of such fruits as causes and effects. So the trees and seeds engage the devotees in meditation about the activities of the Lord, while the mundane wranglers waste time in dry speculation and mental concoction, which are fruitless in both this life and the next.

The answer is that the transcendental ecstasy enjoyed by the devotees in delineating the pastimes of the Lord is certainly unknown to nondevotees and mental speculators. Unless one relishes transcendental joy, naturally one will come back from his speculations and concocted conclusions because he will see them as neither factual nor enjoyable. The devotees can at least know that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, as the Vedic hymns confirm: o\u1e41 tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 pada\u1e41 sad\u0101 pa\u015byanti s\u016braya\u1e25. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15) also confirms this fact: vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. By culture of Vedic knowledge one must know Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and should not falsely speculate on the word aham, or \u201cI.\u201d The only method for understanding the Supreme Truth is devotional service, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55): bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25. Only by devotional service can one know that the ultimate truth is the Personality of Godhead and that Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101 are only His partial features. This is confirmed in this verse by the great sage Maitreya. With devotion he offers his sincere surrender, nama\u1e25, to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, bhagavate. One has to follow in the footsteps of great sages and devotees like Maitreya and Vidura, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it and \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, and engage in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord if one would know His ultimate feature, which is above Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101."
