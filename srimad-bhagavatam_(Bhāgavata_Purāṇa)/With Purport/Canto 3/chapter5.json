Vidura had already surpassed the fallible nature of the living entity in conditional life due to his being acyuta-bh\u0101va, or legitimately absorbed in the devotional service of the Lord. This stage of life is called acyuta-bh\u0101va-siddha, or perfection by dint of devotional service. Anyone, therefore, who is absorbed in the devotional service of the Lord is a liberated soul and has all admirable qualities. The learned sage Maitreya was sitting in a solitary place on the bank of the Ganges at Hardwar, and Vidura, who was a perfect devotee of the Lord and possessed all good transcendental qualities, approached him for inquiry."

On the contrary, one is only aggravated by such activities. Please, therefore, give us directions on how one should live for real happiness.",
        "purport": " Vidura asked Maitreya some common questions, which was not originally his intention. Uddhava asked Vidura to approach Maitreya Muni and inquire into all the truths concerning the Lord \u2014 His name, fame, qualities, form, pastimes, entourage, etc. \u2014 and thus when Vidura approached Maitreya, he should have asked only about the Lord. But out of natural humility he did not immediately ask about the Lord, but inquired into a subject which would be of great importance to the common man. A common man cannot understand the Lord. He must first know the real position of his life under the influence of the illusory energy. In illusion one thinks that he can be happy only by fruitive activities, but what actually happens is that one becomes more and more entangled in the network of action and reaction and does not find any solution to the problem of life. There is a nice song in this connection: \u201cBecause of a great desire to have all happiness in life, I built this house. But unfortunately the whole scheme has turned to ashes because the house was unexpectedly set on fire.\u201d The law of nature is like that. Everyone tries to become happy by planning in the material world, but the law of nature is so cruel that it sets fire to one\u2019s schemes; the fruitive worker is not happy in his schemes, nor is there any satiation of his continuous hankering for happiness."

        "purport": " As already explained in the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the Absolute Truth is realized in three different phases \u2014 although they are one and the same \u2014 in terms of the knower\u2019s capacity to understand. The most capable transcendentalist is the pure devotee of the Lord, who is without any tinge of fruitive actions or philosophical speculation. By devotional service only does one\u2019s heart become completely purified from all material coverings like karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga. Only in such a purified stage does the Lord, who is seated in everyone\u2019s heart with the individual soul, give instruction so that the devotee can reach the ultimate destination of going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 satata-yukt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 bhajat\u0101m. Only when the Lord is satisfied with the devotional service of the devotee does He impart knowledge, as He did for Arjuna and Uddhava. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, yog\u012bs and karm\u012bs cannot expect this direct cooperation of the Lord. They are not able to satisfy the Lord by transcendental loving service, nor do they believe in such service to the Lord. The bhakti process, as performed under the regulative principles of vaidhi-bhakti, or devotional service following the prescribed rules and regulations, is defined by the revealed scriptures and confirmed by great \u0101c\u0101ryas. This practice can help the neophyte devotee to rise to the stage of r\u0101ga-bhakti, in which the Lord responds from within as the caitya-guru, or the spiritual master as Superconsciousness. All transcendentalists other than devotees make no distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul because they miscalculate the Superconsciousness and the individual consciousness to be one and the same. Such miscalculation by the nondevotees makes them unfit to receive any direction from within, and therefore they are bereft of the direct cooperation of the Lord. After many, many births, when such a nondualist comes to sense that the Lord is worshipable and that the devotee is simultaneously one with and different from the Lord, then only can he surrender unto the Lord, V\u0101sudeva. Pure devotional service begins from that point. The process of understanding the Absolute Truth adopted by the misguided nondualist is very difficult, whereas the devotee\u2019s way of understanding the Absolute Truth comes directly from the Lord, who is pleased by devotional service. On behalf of many neophyte devotees, Vidura, at the very first instance, inquired from Maitreya about the path of devotional service, by which the Lord, who is seated within the heart, can be pleased."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Personality of Godhead from whom the three creative incarnations, namely the puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ras \u2014 K\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101r\u1e47ava\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2014 expand. The whole material creation is conducted by the three puru\u1e63as in successive stages under the external energy of the Lord, and thus material nature is controlled by Him. Thinking material nature to be independent is like seeking milk from the nipplelike bags on the neck of a goat. The Lord is independent and desireless. He does not create the material world for His own satisfaction as we create our household affairs to fulfill our material desires. Actually the material world is created for the illusory enjoyment of the conditioned souls, who have been against the transcendental service of the Lord since time immemorial. But the material universes are full in themselves. There is no scarcity for maintenance in the material world. Because of their poor fund of knowledge, the materialists are disturbed when there is an apparent increase of population on the earth. Whenever there is a living being on the earth, however, his subsistence is immediately arranged by the Lord. The other species of living entities, who far outnumber human society, are never disturbed for maintenance; they are never seen dying of starvation. It is only human society that is disturbed about the food situation and, to cover up the real fact of administrative mismanagement, takes shelter in the plea that the population is excessively increasing. If there is any scarcity in the world, it is the scarcity of God consciousness; otherwise, by the grace of the Lord, there is no scarcity of anything."

There is no difference regarding the creative principles and the Lord\u2019s control over them, yet there are some differences in the minute details because of different kalpas. The gigantic sky is the material body of the Lord, called the vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa, and all material creations are resting on the sky, or the heart of the Lord.

        "translation": "You may narrate also about the auspicious characteristics of the Lord in His different incarnations for the welfare of the twice-born, the cows and the demigods. Our minds are never satisfied completely, although we continuously hear of His transcendental activities.",
        "purport": " The Lord appears in this universe in different incarnations like Matsya, K\u016brma, Var\u0101ha and N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, and He manifests His different transcendental activities for the welfare of the twice-born, the cows and the demigods. The Lord is directly concerned with the twice-born or civilized men. A civilized man is one who has taken his birth twice. A living entity takes birth in this mundane world due to the union of male and female. A human being is born due to union of the father and mother, but a civilized human being has another birth by contact with a spiritual master, who becomes the actual father. The father and mother of the material body are so only in one birth, and in the next birth the father and mother may be a different couple. But the bona fide spiritual master, as the representative of the Lord, is the eternal father because the spiritual master has the responsibility to lead the disciple to spiritual salvation, or the ultimate goal of life. Therefore, a civilized man must be twice-born; otherwise he is no more than the lower animals. The cow is the most important animal for developing the human body to perfection. The body can be maintained by any kind of foodstuff, but cow\u2019s milk is particularly essential for developing the finer tissues of the human brain so that one can understand the intricacies of transcendental knowledge. A civilized man is expected to live on foodstuffs comprising fruits, vegetables, grains, sugar and milk. The bull helps in the agricultural process of producing grain, etc., and thus in one sense the bull is the father of humankind, whereas the cow is the mother, for she supplies milk to human society. A civilized man is therefore expected to give all protection to the bulls and cows. The demigods, or the living entities who live in the higher planets, are far superior to human beings. Since they have better arrangements for living conditions, they live far more luxuriously than human beings, yet they are all devotees of the Lord. The Lord incarnates in different forms, such as those of a fish, a tortoise, a hog, and a combined lion and man, just to give protection to civilized man, the cow and the demigods, who are directly responsible for the regulative life of progressive self-realization. The whole system of the material creation is planned so that the conditioned souls may have the opportunity for self-realization. One who takes advantage of such an arrangement is called a demigod or civilized man. The cow is meant to help maintain such a high standard of living. The Lord\u2019s pastimes for the protection of the twice-born civilized men, the cows and the demigods are all transcendental. A human being is inclined to hear good narrations and stories, and therefore there are so many books, magazines and newspapers on the market to satisfy the interests of the developed soul. But the pleasure in such literature, after it is read once, becomes stale, and people do not take any interest in reading such literature repeatedly. In fact, newspapers are read for less than an hour and then thrown in the dustbins as rubbish. The case is similar with all other mundane literatures. But the beauty of transcendental literatures like Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is that they never become old. They have been read in the world by civilized man for the last five thousand years, and they have never become old. They are ever fresh to the learned scholars and devotees, and even by daily repetition of the verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, there is no satiation for devotees like Vidura. Vidura might have heard the pastimes of the Lord many, many times before he met Maitreya, but still he wanted the same narrations to be repeated because he was never satiated by hearing them. That is the transcendental nature of the Lord\u2019s glorious pastimes."

Even on this planet there are different places for inhabitation by different types of men. There are places like deserts, ice lands, and valleys in mountainous countries, and in each of them there are different kinds of men born of different modes of nature according to their past deeds. There are people in the Arabian deserts and in the valleys of the Himalayan Mountains, and the inhabitants of these two places differ from one another, just as the inhabitants of the ice lands also differ from them. Similarly, there are also different planets. The planets below the earth down to the P\u0101t\u0101la planet are full of various kinds of living beings; no planet is vacant, as wrongly imagined by the modern so-called scientist. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we find it said by the Lord that the living entities are sarva-gata, or present in every sphere of life. So there is no doubt that on other planets there are also inhabitants like us, sometimes with greater intelligence and greater opulence. The living conditions for those of greater intelligence are more luxurious than on this earth. There are also planets where no sunlight reaches, and there are living entities who must live there due to their past deeds. All such plans for living conditions are made by the Supreme Lord, and Vidura requested Maitreya to describe this for the sake of further enlightenment."

        "translation": "O my lord, I have repeatedly heard about these higher and lower statuses of human society from the mouth of Vy\u0101sadeva, and I am quite satiated with all these lesser subject matters and their happiness. They have not satisfied me with the nectar of topics about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
        "purport": " Because people are very much interested in hearing social and historical presentations, \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva has compiled many books such as the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. These books are reading matter for the mass of people, and they were compiled with a view to reviving their God consciousness, now forgotten in the conditional life of material existence. The real purpose of such literatures is not so much to present topics of historical references, but to revive the people\u2019s sense of God consciousness. For example, Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is the history of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and common people read it because it is full of topics regarding the social, political and economic problems of human society. But factually the most important part of Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which is automatically taught to readers along with the historical narrations of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Vidura explained to Maitreya his position of being fully satiated with the knowledge of mundane social and political topics and having no more interest in them. He was anxious to hear transcendental topics regarding Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Because there were insufficient topics directly concerning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, etc., he was not satisfied and wanted to know more about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, or topics regarding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are transcendental, and there is no satiation in hearing such topics. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is important on account of its being k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, or speeches delivered by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The story of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra may be interesting for the mass of people, but to a person like Vidura, who is highly advanced in devotional service, only k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 and that which is dovetailed with k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 is interesting. Vidura wanted to hear of everything from Maitreya, and so he inquired from him, but he desired that all the topics be in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As fire is never satisfied in its consumption of firewood, so a pure devotee of the Lord never hears enough about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Historical events and other narrations concerning social and political incidents all become transcendental as soon as they are in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the way to transform mundane things into spiritual identity. The whole world can be transformed into Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha if all worldly activities are dovetailed with k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101. There are two important k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101s current in the world \u2014 Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 because it is spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 because it narrates about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord Caitanya advised all His disciples to preach k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 all over the world without discrimination because the transcendental value of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 can purify one and all from material contamination."

Such topics can cut off one\u2019s bondage to family affection simply by entering the holes of one\u2019s ears.",
        "purport": " K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 is so powerful that simply by entering into a person\u2019s ear it can at once give deliverance from the bondage of family affection. Family affection is an illusory manifestation of the external energy, and it is the only impetus for all mundane activities. As long as there is mundane activity and the mind is absorbed in such engagement, one has to undergo the repetition of birth and death in the current material nescience. People are most influenced by the mode of ignorance, and some are influenced by the passionate mode of material nature, and under the spell of these two modes a living being is actuated by the material conception of life. The mundane qualities do not allow a living entity to understand his real position. The qualities of both ignorance and passion strongly bind one to the illusory bodily conception of the self. The best among the fools who are thus deluded are those who engage in altruistic activities under the spell of the material mode of passion. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which is direct k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, gives humanity the elementary lesson that the body is perishable and that the consciousness which is spread throughout the body is imperishable. The conscious being, the imperishable self, is eternally existent and cannot be killed under any circumstances, even after the dissolution of the body. Anyone who misunderstands this perishable body to be the self and who works for it in the name of sociology, politics, philanthropy, altruism, nationalism or internationalism, under the false plea of the bodily conception of life, is certainly a fool and does not know the implications of reality and unreality. Some of them are above the modes of ignorance and passion and are situated in the mode of goodness, but mundane goodness is always contaminated by tinges of ignorance and passion. Mundane goodness can enlighten one that the body and the self are different, and one in goodness is concerned with the self and not the body. But due to being contaminated, those in mundane goodness cannot understand the real nature of the self as a person. Their impersonal conception of the self as distinct from the body keeps them in the mode of goodness within material nature, and unless they are attracted by k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, they will never be liberated from the bondage of material existence. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 is the only remedy for all people of the world because it can situate one in pure consciousness of the self and liberate one from material bondage. To preach k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 all over the world, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, is the greatest missionary activity, and all sensible men and women of the world may join in this great movement started by Lord Caitanya."

But the whole idea is to draw the attention of the mass of people to k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 [Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101] through their strong affinity for hearing mundane topics.",
        "purport": " The great sage K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-dvaip\u0101yana Vy\u0101sa is the author of all Vedic literature, of which his works Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata are very popular readings. As stated in Bh\u0101gavatam (1.4.25), \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva compiled the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata for the less intelligent class of men, who take more interest in mundane topics than in the philosophy of life. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra was compiled for persons already above the mundane topics, who might already have tasted the bitterness of the so-called happiness of mundane affairs. The first aphorism of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra is ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101, i.e., only when one has finished the business of mundane inquiries in the marketplace of sense gratification can one make relevant inquiries regarding Brahman, the Transcendence. Those persons who are busy with the mundane inquiries which fill the newspapers and other such literatures are classified as str\u012b-\u015b\u016bdra-dvija-bandhus, or women, the laborer class and unworthy sons of the higher classes (br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya and vai\u015bya). Such less intelligent men cannot understand the purpose of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, although they may make a show of studying the s\u016btras in a perverted way. The real purpose of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra is explained by the author himself in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and anyone trying to understand Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra without reference to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is certainly misguided. Such misguided persons, who are interested in the mundane affairs of philanthropic and altruistic work under the misconception of the body as the self, could better take advantage of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, which was specifically compiled by \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva for their benefit. The great author has compiled the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata in such a way that the less intelligent class of men, who are more interested in mundane topics, may read the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata with great relish and in the course of such mundane happiness can also take advantage of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the preliminary study of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam or the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva had no interest in writing a history of mundane activities other than to give less intelligent persons a chance for transcendental realization through Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Vidura\u2019s reference to the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata indicates that he had heard of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata from Vy\u0101sadeva, his real father, while he was away from home and was touring the places of pilgrimage."

The Lord is the Absolute Truth, and therefore His name, form, quality, etc., which are all understood to be k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, are nondifferent from Him. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, being spoken by the Lord, is as good as the Lord Himself. When a sincere devotee reads Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, this is as good as seeing the Lord face to face in his personal presence, but this is not so for the mundane wrangler. All the potencies of the Lord are there when one reads Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, provided it is read in the way recommended in the G\u012bt\u0101 by the Lord Himself. One cannot foolishly manufacture an interpretation of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and still bring about transcendental benefit. Anyone who tries to squeeze some artificial meaning or interpretation from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 for an ulterior motive is not \u015braddadh\u0101na-pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 (one engaged anxiously in bona fide hearing of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101). Such a person cannot derive any benefit from reading Bhagavad-g\u012bta, however great a scholar he may be in the estimation of a layman. The \u015braddadh\u0101na, or faithful devotee, can actually derive all the benefits of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 because by the omnipotency of the Lord he achieves the transcendental bliss which vanquishes attachment and nullifies all concomitant material miseries. Only the devotee, by his factual experience, can understand the import of this verse spoken by Vidura. The pure devotee of the Lord enjoys life by constantly remembering the lotus feet of the Lord by hearing k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101. For such a devotee there is no such thing as material existence, and the much-advertised bliss of brahm\u0101nanda is like a fig for the devotee who is in the midst of the transcendental ocean of bliss."

        "purport": " According to the modes of material nature, there are three kinds of relationships between human beings and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are in the modes of ignorance and passion are averse to the existence of God, or else they formally accept the existence of God in the capacity of an order supplier. Above them are those who are in the mode of goodness. This second class of men believe the Supreme Brahman to be impersonal. They accept the cult of bhakti, in which hearing of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 is the first item, as a means and not the end. Above them are those who are pure devotees. They are situated in the transcendental stage above the mode of material goodness. Such persons are decidedly convinced that the name, form, fame, qualities, etc., of the Personality of Godhead are nondifferent from one another on the absolute plane. For them, hearing of the topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is equal to meeting with Him face to face. According to this class of men, who are situated in pure devotional service to the Lord, the highest goal of human life is puru\u1e63\u0101rtha, devotional service to the Lord, the real mission of life. The impersonalists, because they engage in mental speculation and have no faith in the Personality of Godhead, have no business hearing the topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such persons are pitiable for the first-class pure devotees of the Lord. The pitiable impersonalists pity those who are influenced by the modes of ignorance and passion, but the pure devotees of the Lord take pity on them both because both waste their most valuable time in the human form of life in false pursuits, namely sense enjoyment and mental speculative presentations of different theories and goals of life."

In both cases there is nothing for them to say of God. Both the nonbelievers and the impersonalists deny the essence of all topics; therefore, they engage in topics of relativity in various ways, either in sense gratification or in mental speculation. For the pure devotees like Vidura, the topics of both the mundaners and the mental speculators are useless in all respects. Thus Vidura requested Maitreya to talk of the essence only, the talks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and nothing else."

The birth of a human being is a great science, and therefore reformation of the act of impregnation according to the Vedic ritual called garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra is very important for generating good population. The problem is not to check the growth of the population, but to generate good population on the level of Vidura, Vy\u0101sa and Maitreya. There is no need to check the growth of population if the children are born as human beings with all precautions regarding their birth. So-called birth control is not only vicious but also useless."

Birth, maintenance and death are three conditional states of the living entities who are within the material world. As the appointed controller after death, Yamar\u0101ja once tried M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davya Muni for his childhood profligacy and ordered him to be pierced with a lance. M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davya, being angry at Yamar\u0101ja for awarding him undue punishment, cursed him to become a \u015b\u016bdra (member of the less intelligent laborer class). Thus Yamar\u0101ja took birth in the womb of the kept wife of Vicitrav\u012brya from the semen of Vicitrav\u012brya\u2019s brother, Vy\u0101sadeva. Vy\u0101sadeva is the son of Satyavat\u012b by the great sage Par\u0101\u015bara, and Vicitrav\u012brya is the son of the same Satyavat\u012b by the great king \u015aantanu, the father of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. This mysterious history of Vidura was known to Maitreya Muni because he happened to be a contemporary friend of Vy\u0101sadeva\u2019s. In spite of Vidura\u2019s birth from the womb of a kept wife, because he had otherwise high parentage and great connection he inherited the highest talent of becoming a great devotee of the Lord. To take birth in such a great family is understood to be an advantage for attaining devotional life. Vidura was given this chance due to his previous greatness."

The first line of the original four verses runs, aham ev\u0101sam ev\u0101gre. The word aham is misinterpreted by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da school into meanings which no one but the interpreter can understand. Here aham is explained as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not the individual living entities. Before the creation, there was only the Personality of Godhead; there were no puru\u1e63a incarnations and certainly no living entities, nor was there the material energy, by which the manifested creation is effected. The puru\u1e63a incarnations and all the different energies of the Supreme Lord were merged in Him only. The Personality of Godhead is described herein as the master of all other living entities. He is like the sun disc, and the living entities are like the molecules of the sun\u2019s rays. This existence of the Lord before the creation is confirmed by the \u015brutis: v\u0101sudevo v\u0101 ida\u1e41 agra \u0101s\u012bt na brahm\u0101 na ca \u015ba\u1e45kara\u1e25, eko vai n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u0101s\u012bn na brahm\u0101 ne\u015b\u0101n\u0101\u1e25. Because everything that be is an emanation from the Personality of Godhead, He always exists alone without a second. He can so exist because He is all-perfect and omnipotent. Everything other than Him, including His plenary expansions, the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattvas, is His part and parcel. Before the creation there were no K\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101r\u1e47ava\u015b\u0101y\u012b or Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b or K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47us, nor was there Brahm\u0101 or \u015aa\u1e45kara. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47u plenary expansion and the living entities beginning from Brahm\u0101 are separated parts and parcels. Although the spiritual existence was there with the Lord, the material existence was dormant in Him. By His will only is the material manifestation done and undone. The diversity of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka is one with the Lord, just as the diversity of soldiers is one with and the same as the king. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.7), the material creation takes place at intervals by the will of the Lord, and in the periods between dissolution and creation, the living entities and the material energy remain dormant in Him."

At that time the seer was there, but the external energy, over which the glance of the Lord is cast, was not present. He felt somewhat insufficient, like a husband feeling lonely in the absence of his wife. This is a poetic simile. The Lord wanted to create the cosmic manifestation to give another chance to the conditioned souls who were dormant in forgetfulness. The cosmic manifestation gives the conditioned souls a chance to go back home, back to Godhead, and that is its main purpose. The Lord is so kind that in the absence of such a manifestation He feels something wanting, and thus the creation takes place. Although the creation of the internal potency was manifested, the other potency appeared to be sleeping, and the Lord wanted to awaken her to activity, just as a husband wants to awaken his wife from the sleeping state for enjoyment. It is the compassion of the Lord for the sleeping energy that He wants to see her awaken for enjoyment like the other wives who are awake. The whole process is to enliven the sleeping conditioned souls to the real life of spiritual consciousness so that they may thus become as perfect as the ever-liberated souls in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas. Since the Lord is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, He likes every part and parcel of His different potencies to take part in the blissful rasa because participation with the Lord in His eternal r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101 is the highest living condition, perfect in spiritual bliss and eternal knowledge."

        "purport": " The offspring of any living being is born after the father impregnates the mother with semen, and the living entity floating in the semen of the father takes the shape of the mother\u2019s form. Similarly, mother material nature cannot produce any living entity from her material elements unless and until she is impregnated with living entities by the Lord Himself. That is the mystery of the generation of the living entities. This impregnating process is performed by the first puru\u1e63a incarnation, K\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101r\u1e47ava\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Simply by His glance over material nature, the whole matter is accomplished. We should not understand the process of impregnation by the Personality of Godhead in terms of our conception of sex. The omnipotent Lord can impregnate just by His eyes, and therefore He is called all-potent. Each and every part of His transcendental body can perform each and every function of the other parts. This is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.32): a\u1e45g\u0101ni yasya sakalendriya-v\u1e5bttimanti. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.3) also, the same principle is confirmed: mama yonir mahad-brahma tasmin garbha\u1e41 dadh\u0101my aham. When the cosmic creation is manifested, the living entities are directly supplied from the Lord; they are never products of material nature. Thus, no scientific advancement of material science can ever produce a living being. That is the whole mystery of the material creation. The living entities are foreign to matter, and thus they cannot be happy unless they are situated in the same spiritual life as the Lord. The mistaken living being, out of forgetfulness of this original condition of life, unnecessarily wastes time trying to become happy in the material world. The whole Vedic process is to remind one of this essential feature of life. The Lord offers the conditioned soul a material body for his so-called enjoyment, but if one does not come to his senses and enter into spiritual consciousness, the Lord again puts him in the unmanifested condition as it existed in the beginning of the creation. The Lord is described here as v\u012bryav\u0101n, or the greatest potent being, because He impregnates material nature with innumerable living entities who are conditioned from time immemorial."

He gives the conditioned souls all facilities for rectifying the activities of the false ego, but He does not interfere with their small independence as parts and parcels of the Lord."

All souls who are situated in such pure consciousness are liberated, and therefore they eternally live in bliss and knowledge in the various Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets in the spiritual sky. When the material creation is manifested, it is not meant for them. The eternally liberated souls are called nitya-muktas, and they have nothing to do with the material creation. The material creation is meant for rebellious souls who are not prepared to accept subordination under the Supreme Lord. This spirit of false lordship is called false ego. It is manifested in three modes of material nature, and it exists in mental speculation only. Those who are in the mode of goodness think that each and every person is God, and thus they laugh at the pure devotees, who try to engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Those who are puffed up by the mode of passion try to lord it over material nature in various ways. Some of them engage in altruistic activities as if they were agents appointed to do good to others by their mental speculative plans. Such men accept the standard ways of mundane altruism, but their plans are made on the basis of false ego. This false ego extends to the limit of becoming one with the Lord. The last class of egoistic conditioned souls \u2014 those in the mode of ignorance \u2014 are misguided by identification of the gross body with the self. Thus all their activities are centered around the body only. All these persons are given the chance to play with false egoistic ideas, but at the same time the Lord is kind enough to give them a chance to take help from scriptures like Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam so that they may understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thus make their lives successful. The entire material creation, therefore, is meant for the falsely egoistic living entities hovering on the mental plane under different illusions in the modes of material nature."

When a person forgets his constitutional position as an eternally subordinate part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and wants to be happy independently, he functions mainly in two ways. He first attempts to act fruitively for personal gain or sense gratification, and after attempting such fruitive activities for a considerable time, when he is frustrated he becomes a philosophical speculator and thinks himself to be on the same level as God. This false idea of becoming one with the Lord is the last snare of the illusory energy, which traps a living entity into the bondage of forgetfulness under the spell of false ego. The best means of liberation from the clutches of false ego is to give up the habit of philosophical speculation regarding the Absolute Truth. One should know definitely that the Absolute Truth is never realized by the philosophical speculations of the imperfect egoistic person. The Absolute Truth, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is realized by hearing about Him in all submission and love from a bona fide authority who is a representative of the twelve great authorities mentioned in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. By such an attempt only can one conquer the illusory energy of the Lord, although for others she is unsurpassable, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14)."

        "translation": "Thereafter the water produced from electricity was glanced over by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and mixed with eternal time and external energy. Thus it was transformed into the earth, which is qualified primarily by smell.",
        "purport": " From the descriptions of the physical elements in the above verses it is clear that in all stages the glance of the Supreme is needed with the other additions and alterations. In every transformation, the last finishing touch is the glance of the Lord, who acts as a painter does when he mixes different colors to transform them into a particular color. When one element mixes with another, the number of its qualities increases. For example, the sky is the cause of air. The sky has only one quality, namely sound, but by the interaction of the sky with the glance of the Lord, mixed with eternal time and the external nature, the air is produced, which has two qualities: sound and touch. Similarly, after the air is created, the interaction of sky and air, touched by time, the external energy of the Lord, produces electricity. Next, the interaction of electricity with air and sky, mixed with time, the external energy and the Lord\u2019s glance over them, produces water. In the final stage of sky there is one quality, namely sound; in the air two qualities, sound and touch; in the electricity three qualities, namely sound, touch and form; in the water four qualities: sound, touch, form and taste; and in the last stage of physical development the result is earth, which has all five qualities \u2014 sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Although they are different mixtures of different materials, such mixtures do not take place automatically, just as a mixture of colors does not take place automatically without the touch of the living painter. The automatic system is factually activated by the glancing touch of the Lord. Living consciousness is the final word in all physical changes. This fact is mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10) as follows: The conclusion is that the physical elements may work very wonderfully to the laymen\u2019s eyes, but their workings actually take place under the supervision of the Lord. Those who can mark only the changes of the physical elements and cannot perceive the hidden hands of the Lord behind them are certainly less intelligent persons, although they may be advertised as great material scientists."

They are embodied by eternal time under the external energy, and they are His parts and parcels. Because they were entrusted with different functions of universal duties and were unable to perform them, they offered fascinating prayers to the Lord as follows.",
        "purport": " The conception of various controlling demigods who inhabit the higher planetary systems for the management of universal affairs is not imaginary, as proposed by persons with a poor fund of knowledge. The demigods are expanded parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and they are embodied by time, external energy and partial consciousness of the Supreme. Human beings, animals, birds, etc., are also parts and parcels of the Lord and have different material bodies, but they are not the controlling deities of material affairs. They are, rather, controlled by such demigods. Such control is not superfluous; it is as necessary as the controlling departments in the affairs of a modern state. The demigods should not be despised by the controlled living beings. They are all great devotees of the Lord entrusted to execute certain functions of universal affairs. One may be angry with Yamar\u0101ja for his thankless task of punishing sinful souls, but Yamar\u0101ja is one of the authorized devotees of the Lord, and so are all the other demigods. A devotee of the Lord is never controlled by such deputed demigods, who function as assistants of the Lord, but he shows them all respects on account of the responsible positions to which they have been appointed by the Lord. At the same time, a devotee of the Lord does not foolishly mistake them to be the Supreme Lord. Only foolish persons accept the demigods as being on the same level as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; actually they are all appointed as servants of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Anyone who places the Lord and the demigods on the same level is called a p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b, or atheist. The demigods are worshiped by persons who are more or less adherents of the processes of j\u00f1\u0101na, yoga and karma, i.e., the impersonalists, meditators and fruitive workers. The devotees, however, worship only the Supreme Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This worship is not for any material benefit, as desired by all the materialists, even up to the salvationists, mystics and fruitive workers. Devotees worship the Supreme Lord to attain unalloyed devotion to the Lord. The Lord, however, is not worshiped by others, who have no program for attaining love of God, which is the essential aim of human life. Persons averse to a loving relationship with God are more or less condemned by their own actions. The Lord is equal to every living entity, just like the flowing Ganges. The Ganges water is meant for the purification of everyone, yet the trees on the banks of the Ganges have different values. A mango tree on the bank of the Ganges drinks the water, and the nimba tree also drinks the same water. But the fruits of both trees are different. One is celestially sweet, and the other is hellishly bitter. The condemned bitterness of the nimba is due to its own past work, just as the sweetness of the mango is also due to its own karma. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.19): \u201cThe envious, the mischievous, the lowest of mankind \u2014 these do I ever put back into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.\u201d Demigods like Yamar\u0101ja and other controllers are there for the unwanted conditioned souls who always engage in threatening the tranquillity of the kingdom of God. Since all the demigods are confidential devotee-servitors of the Lord, they are never to be condemned."

It is the path of reality by which the living entity can attain the transcendental happiness of being freed from the three kinds of material miseries \u2014 miseries arising from the body and mind, from other living entities and from natural disturbances. Everyone who is conditioned by material existence \u2014 whether he be a man or beast or demigod or bird \u2014 must suffer from \u0101dhy\u0101tmika (bodily or mental) pains, \u0101dhibhautika pains (those offered by living creatures), and \u0101dhidaivika pains (those due to supernatural disturbances). His happiness is nothing but a hard struggle to get free from the miseries of conditional life. But there is only one way he can be rescued, and that is by accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The argument that unless one has proper knowledge one cannot be freed from material miseries is undoubtedly true. But because the lotus feet of the Lord are full of transcendental knowledge, acceptance of His lotus feet completes that necessity. We have already discussed this point in the First Canto (1.2.7): There is no want of knowledge in the devotional service of V\u0101sudeva, the Personality of Godhead. He, the Lord, personally takes charge of dissipating the darkness of ignorance from the heart of a devotee. He confirms this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): Empiric philosophical speculation cannot give one relief from the threefold miseries of material existence. Simply to endeavor for knowledge without devoting oneself to the Lord is a waste of valuable time."

Some of them surrender to Your lotus feet at every step by taking shelter of the best of rivers [the Ganges], which can deliver one from all sinful reactions.",
        "purport": " The paramaha\u1e41sas are compared to royal swans who make their nests on the petals of the lotus flower. The Lord\u2019s transcendental bodily parts are always compared to the lotus flower because in the material world the lotus flower is the last word in beauty. The most beautiful thing in the world is the Vedas, or Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, because therein knowledge is imparted by the Personality of Godhead Himself. The paramaha\u1e41sa makes his nest in the lotuslike face of the Lord and always seeks shelter at His lotus feet, which are reached by the wings of Vedic wisdom. Since the Lord is the original source of all emanations, intelligent persons, enlightened by Vedic knowledge, seek the shelter of the Lord, just as birds who leave the nest again search out the nest to take complete rest. All Vedic knowledge is meant for understanding the Supreme Lord, as stated by the Lord in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. Intelligent persons, who are like swans, take shelter of the Lord by all means and do not hover on the mental plane by fruitlessly speculating on different philosophies. The Lord is so kind that He has spread the river Ganges throughout the universe so that by taking bath in that holy river everyone can get release from the reactions of sins, which occur at every step. There are many rivers in the world which are able to evoke one\u2019s sense of God consciousness simply by one\u2019s bathing in them, and the river Ganges is chief amongst them. In India there are five sacred rivers, but the Ganges is the most sacred. The river Ganges and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 are chief sources of transcendental happiness for mankind, and intelligent persons can take shelter of them to go back home, back to Godhead. Even \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya recommends that a little knowledge in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and the drinking of a little quantity of Ganges water can save one from the punishment of Yamar\u0101ja."

        "purport": " The miracles of meditating on the lotus feet of the Lord with eagerness and devotion are so great that no other process can compare to it. The minds of materialistic persons are so disturbed that it is almost impossible for them to search after the Supreme Truth by personal regulative endeavors. But even such materialistic men, with a little eagerness for hearing about the transcendental name, fame, qualities, etc., can surpass all other methods of attaining knowledge and detachment. The conditioned soul is attached to the bodily conception of the self, and therefore he is in ignorance. Culture of self-knowledge can bring about detachment from material affection, and without such detachment there is no meaning to knowledge. The most stubborn attachment for material enjoyment is sex life. One who is attached to sex life is to be understood as devoid of knowledge. Knowledge must be followed by detachment. That is the way of self-realization. These two essentials for self-realization \u2014 knowledge and detachment \u2014 become manifest very quickly if one performs devotional service to the lotus feet of the Lord. The word dh\u012bra is very significant in this connection. A person who is not disturbed even in the presence of cause of disturbance is called dh\u012bra. \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya says, \u201cSince my heart has been overwhelmed by the devotional service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I cannot even think of sex life, and if thoughts of sex come upon me I at once feel disgust.\u201d A devotee of the Lord becomes an elevated dh\u012bra by the simple process of meditating in eagerness on the lotus feet of the Lord. Devotional service entails being initiated by a bona fide spiritual master and following his instruction in regard to hearing about the Lord. Such a bona fide spiritual master is accepted by regularly hearing from him about the Lord. The improvement in knowledge and detachment can be perceived by devotees as an actual experience. Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu strongly recommended this process of hearing from a bona fide devotee, and by following this process one can achieve the highest result, conquering all other methods."

They are the controllers or masters of the three modes of material nature, which cause the phenomenal manifestation. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the master of the mode of goodness, Brahm\u0101 is the master of the mode of passion, and Mahe\u015bvara is the master of the mode of ignorance. There are different kinds of devotees according to the modes of nature. Persons in the mode of goodness worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, those in the mode of passion worship Lord Brahm\u0101, and those in the mode of ignorance worship Lord \u015aiva. All three of these deities are incarnations of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demigods directly refer to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and not to the different incarnations. The incarnation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in the material world is, however, directly worshiped by the demigods. It is learned from various scriptures that the demigods approach Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in the Ocean of Milk and submit their grievances whenever there is some difficulty in the administration of universal affairs. Although they are incarnations of the Lord, Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and thus they are also counted amongst the demigods and not as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Persons who worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are called demigods, and persons who do not do so are called asuras, or demons. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u always takes the part of the demigods, but Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva sometimes take the side of the demons; it is not that they become one in interest with them, but sometimes they do something in order to gain control over the demons."

        "translation": "O great Supreme Lord, offensive persons whose internal vision has been too affected by external materialistic activities cannot see Your lotus feet, but they are seen by Your pure devotees, whose one and only aim is to transcendentally enjoy Your activities.",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61), the Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart. It is natural that one should he able to see the Lord at least within himself. But that is not possible for those whose internal vision has been covered by external activities. The pure soul, which is symptomized by consciousness, can be easily perceived even by a common man because consciousness is spread all over the body. The yoga system as recommended in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is to concentrate the mental activities internally and thus see the lotus feet of the Lord within oneself. But there are many so-called yog\u012bs who have no concern with the Lord but are only concerned with consciousness, which they accept as the final realization. Such realization of consciousness is taught by Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 within only a few minutes, whereas the so-called yog\u012bs take continuous years to realize it because of their offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord. The greatest offense is to deny the existence of the Lord as separate from the individual souls or to accept the Lord and the individual soul as one and the same. The impersonalists misinterpret the theory of reflection, and thus they wrongly accept the individual consciousness as the supreme consciousness. The theory of the reflection of the Supreme can be clearly understood without difficulty by any sincere common man. When there is a reflection of the sky on the water, both the sky and the stars are seen within the water, but it is understood that the sky and the stars are not to be accepted on the same level. The stars are parts of the sky, and therefore they cannot be equal to the whole. The sky is the whole, and the stars are parts. They cannot be one and the same. Transcendentalists who do not accept the supreme consciousness as separate from the individual consciousness are as offensive as the materialists who deny even the existence of the Lord. Such offenders cannot actually see the lotus feet of the Lord within themselves, nor are they even able to see the devotees of the Lord. The devotees of the Lord are so kind that they roam to all places to enlighten people in God consciousness. The offenders, however, lose the chance to receive the Lord\u2019s devotees, although the offenseless common man is at once influenced by the devotees\u2019 presence. In this connection there is an interesting story of a hunter and Devar\u1e63i N\u0101rada. A hunter in the forest, although a great sinner, was not an intentional offender. He was at once influenced by the presence of N\u0101rada, and he agreed to take the path of devotion, leaving aside his hearth and home. But the offenders Nalak\u016bvara and Ma\u1e47igr\u012bva, even though living amongst the demigods, had to undergo the punishment of becoming trees in their next lives, although by the grace of a devotee they were later delivered by the Lord. Offenders have to wait until they receive the mercy of devotees, and then they can become eligible to see the lotus feet of the Lord within themselves. But due to their offenses and their extreme materialism, they cannot see even the devotees of the Lord. Engaged in external activities, they kill the internal vision. The Lord\u2019s devotees, however, do not mind the offenses of the foolish in their many gross and subtle bodily endeavors. The Lord\u2019s devotees continue to bestow the blessings of devotion upon all such offenders without hesitation. That is the nature of devotees."

In spite of his strenuous efforts to attain perfect knowledge, the impersonalist attains merging into the impersonal oneness of the brahmajyoti of the Lord, which is also attained by the enemies of the Lord simply because of their being killed by Him. The devotees, however, attain to the highest stage of knowledge and renunciation and achieve the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas, the planets in the spiritual sky. The impersonalist attains only the sky, and does not achieve any tangible transcendental bliss, whereas the devotee attains to the planets where real spiritual life prevails. With a serious attitude, the devotee throws away all achievements like so much dust, and he accepts only devotional service, the transcendental culmination."

        "translation": "Others, who are pacified by means of transcendental self-realization and have conquered over the modes of nature by dint of strong power and knowledge, also enter into You, but for them there is much pain, whereas the devotee simply discharges devotional service and thus feels no such pain.",
        "purport": " In terms of a labor of love and its returns, the bhaktas, or devotees of the Lord, always have priority over persons who are addicted to the association of j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, or impersonalists, and yog\u012bs, or mystics. The word apare (others) is very significant in this connection. \u201cOthers\u201d refers to the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and the yog\u012bs, whose only hope is to merge into the existence of the impersonal brahmajyoti. Although their destination is not so important in comparison to the destination of the devotees, the labor of the nondevotees is far greater than that of the bhaktas. One may suggest that there is sufficient labor for the devotees also in the matter of discharging devotional service. But that labor is compensated by the enhancement of transcendental pleasure. The devotees derive more transcendental pleasure while engaged continuously in the service of the Lord than when they have no such engagement. In the family combination of a man and a woman there is much labor and responsibility for both of them, yet when they are single they feel more trouble for want of their united activities. The union of the impersonalists and the union of the devotees are not on a par. The impersonalists try to fully stop their individuality by attaining s\u0101yujya-mukti, or unification by merging into oneness, whereas the devotees keep their individuality to exchange feelings in relationship with the supreme individual Lord. Such reciprocation of feelings takes place in the transcendental Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, and therefore the liberation sought by the impersonalists is already achieved in devotional service. The devotees attain mukti automatically, while continuing the transcendental pleasure of maintaining individuality. As explained in the previous verse, the destination of the devotees is Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, or aku\u1e47\u1e6dha-dhi\u1e63\u1e47ya, the place where anxieties are completely eradicated. One should not mistake the destination of the devotees and that of the impersonalists to be one and the same. The destinations are distinctly different, and the transcendental pleasure derived by the devotee is also distinct from cin-m\u0101tra, or spiritual feelings alone."

        "purport": " Developed consciousness begins from the human form of life and further increases in the forms of the demigods living in higher planets. The earth is situated almost in the middle of the universe, and the human form of life is the intermediate stage between the life of the demigods and that of the demons. The planetary systems above the earth are especially meant for the higher intellectuals, called demigods. They are called demigods because although their standard of life is far more advanced in culture, enjoyment, luxury, beauty, education and duration of life, they are always fully God conscious. Such demigods are always ready to render service to the Supreme Lord because they are perfectly aware of the fact that every living entity is constitutionally an eternal subordinate servitor of the Lord. They also know that it is the Lord only who can maintain all living entities with all the necessities of life. The Vedic hymns, eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n, t\u0101 enam abruvann \u0101yatana\u1e41 na\u1e25 praj\u0101n\u012bhi yasmin prati\u1e63\u1e6dhit\u0101 annam ad\u0101me, etc., confirm this truth. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also, the Lord is mentioned as bh\u016bta-bh\u1e5bt, or the maintainer of all living creatures. The modern theory that starvation is due to an increase in population is not accepted by the demigods or the devotees of the Lord. The devotees or demigods are fully aware that the Lord can maintain any number of living entities, provided they are conscious of how to eat. If they want to eat like ordinary animals, who have no God consciousness, then they must live in starvation, poverty and want, like the jungle animals in the forest. The jungle animals are also maintained by the Lord with their respective foodstuffs, but they are not advanced in God consciousness. Similarly, human beings are provided with food grains, vegetables, fruits and milk by the grace of the Lord, but it is the duty of human beings to acknowledge the mercy of the Lord. As a matter of gratitude, they should feel obliged to the Lord for their supply of foodstuff, and they must first offer Him food in sacrifice and then partake of the remnants. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.13) it is confirmed that one who takes foodstuff after a performance of sacrifice eats real food for proper maintenance of the body and soul, but one who cooks for himself and does not perform any sacrifice eats only lumps of sin in the shape of foodstuffs. Such sinful eating can never make one happy or free from scarcity. Famine is not due to an increase in population, as less intelligent economists think. When human society is grateful to the Lord for all His gifts for the maintenance of the living entities, then there is certainly no scarcity or want in society. But when men are unaware of the intrinsic value of such gifts from the Lord, surely they are in want. A person who has no God consciousness may live in opulence for the time being due to his past virtuous acts, but if one forgets his relationship with the Lord, certainly he must await the stage of starvation by the law of the powerful material nature. One cannot escape the vigilance of the powerful material nature unless he leads a God conscious or devotional life."

O Lord, You have no source or superior. You have impregnated the external energy with the semen of the total living entities, yet You are unborn.",
        "purport": " The Lord, the original person, is the father of all other living entities, beginning from Brahm\u0101, the personality from whom all other living entities in different gradations of species are generated. Yet the supreme father has no other father. Every one of the living entities of all grades, up to Brahm\u0101, the original creature of the universe, is begotten by a father, but He, the Lord, has no father. When He descends to the material plane, out of His causeless mercy He accepts one of His great devotees as His father to keep pace with the rules of the material world. But since He is the Lord, He is always independent in choosing who will become His father. For example, the Lord came out of a pillar in His incarnation as N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, and by the Lord\u2019s causeless mercy, Ahaly\u0101 came out of a stone by the touch of the lotus feet of His incarnation as Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101ma. He is also the companion of every living entity as the Supersoul, but He is unchanged. The living entity changes his body in the material world, but even when the Lord is in the material world, He is ever unchanged. That is His prerogative. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.3), the Lord impregnates the external or material energy, and thus the total living entities later come out in different gradations, beginning from Brahm\u0101, the first demigod, down to the insignificant ant. All gradations of living entities are manifested by Brahm\u0101 and the external energy, but the Lord is the original father of everyone. The relationship of every living being with the Supreme Lord is certainly one of son and father and not one of equality. Sometimes in love the son is more than the father, but the relationship of father and son is one of the superior and the subordinate. Every living entity, however great he may be, even up to demigods like Brahm\u0101 and Indra, is an eternally subordinate servitor of the supreme father. The mahat-tattva principle is the generating source of all the modes of material nature, and the living entities take birth in the material world in bodies supplied by the mother, material nature, in terms of their previous work. The body is a gift of material nature, but the soul is originally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord."

Kindly award us Your perfect knowledge and potency so that we can render You service in the different departments of subsequent creation.",
        "purport": " The Lord creates this material world and impregnates the material energy with the living entities who will act in the material world. All these actions have a divine plan behind them. The plan is to give the conditioned souls who so desire it a chance to enjoy sense gratification. But there is another plan behind the creation: to help the living entities realize that they are created for the transcendental sense gratification of the Lord and not for their individual sense gratification. This is the constitutional position of the living entities. The Lord is one without a second, and He expands Himself into many for His transcendental pleasure. All the expansions \u2014 the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattvas, the j\u012bva-tattvas and the \u015bakti-tattvas (the Personalities of Godhead, the living entities and the different potencies) \u2014 are different offshoots from the same one Supreme Lord. The j\u012bva-tattvas are separated expansions of the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattvas, and although the j\u012bvas have different potencies, they are all meant for the transcendental sense gratification of the Supreme Lord. Some of the j\u012bvas, however, wanted to lord it over material nature in imitation of the lordship of the Personality of Godhead. Regarding when and why such propensities overcame the pure living entities, it can only be explained that the j\u012bva-tattvas have infinitesimal independence and that due to misuse of this independence some of the living entities have become implicated in the conditions of cosmic creation and are therefore called nitya-baddhas, or eternally conditioned souls. The expansions of Vedic wisdom also give the nitya-baddhas, the conditioned living entities, a chance to improve, and those who take advantage of such transcendental knowledge gradually regain their lost consciousness of rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord. The demigods are amongst the conditioned souls who have developed this pure consciousness of service to the Lord but who at the same time continue to desire to lord it over the material energy. Such mixed consciousness puts a conditioned soul in the position of managing the affairs of this creation. The demigods are entrusted leaders of the conditioned souls. As some of the old prisoners in government jails are entrusted with some responsible work of prison management, so the demigods are improved conditioned souls acting as representatives of the Lord in the material creation. Such demigods are devotees of the Lord in the material world, and when completely free from all material desire to lord it over the material energy they become pure devotees and have no desire but to serve the Lord. Therefore any living entity who desires a position in the material world may desire so in the service of the Lord and may seek power and intelligence from the Lord, as exemplified by the demigods in this particular verse. One cannot do anything unless he is enlightened and empowered by the Lord. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca. All recollections, knowledge, etc., as well as all forgetfulness, are engineered by the Lord, who is sitting within the heart of everyone. The intelligent man seeks the help of the Lord, and the Lord helps the sincere devotees engaged in His multifarious services. The demigods are entrusted by the Lord to create different species of living entities according to their past deeds. They are herein asking the favor of the Lord for the intelligence and power to carry out their task. Similarly, any conditioned soul may also engage in the service of the Lord under the guidance of an expert spiritual master and thus gradually become freed from the entanglement of material existence. The spiritual master is the manifested representative of the Lord, and anyone who puts himself under the guidance of a spiritual master and acts accordingly is said to be acting in terms of buddhi-yoga, as explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.41):"
