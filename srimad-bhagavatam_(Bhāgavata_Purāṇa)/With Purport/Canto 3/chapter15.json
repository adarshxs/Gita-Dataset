There are two classes of men \u2014 devotees and nondevotees. Nondevotees are called demons, and devotees are called demigods. No sane man or woman can tolerate the nondevotees\u2019 giving trouble to devotees. Diti, therefore, was reluctant to give birth to her babies; she waited for one hundred years so that at least she could save the demigods from the disturbance for that period."

        "purport": " The purpose of yogic performances is explained here. It is said that an experienced mystic attains full control of the senses and the mind by controlling the breathing process. Therefore, controlling the breathing process is not the ultimate aim of yoga. The real purpose of yogic performances is to control the mind and the senses. Anyone who has such control is to be understood to be an experienced, mature mystic yog\u012b. It is indicated herein that a yog\u012b who has control over the mind and senses has the actual benediction of the Lord, and he has no fear. In other words, one cannot attain the mercy and benediction of the Supreme Lord until one is able to control the mind and the senses. This is actually possible when one fully engages in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A person whose senses and mind are always engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord has no possibility of engaging in material activities. The devotees of the Lord are not defeated anywhere in the universe. It is stated, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101\u1e25 sarve: one who is n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-para, or a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is not afraid anywhere, whether he is sent to hell or promoted to heaven (Bh\u0101g. 6.17.28)."

        "purport": " The kingdom of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the spiritual sky cannot be understood by any process other than hearing from the description of the Vedas. No one can go see it. In this material world also, one who is unable to pay to go to a far distant place by motorized conveyances can only understand about that place from authentic books. Similarly, the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets in the spiritual sky are beyond this material sky. The modern scientists who are trying to travel in space are having difficulty going even to the nearest planet, the moon, to say nothing of the highest planets within the universe. There is no possibility that they can go beyond the material sky, enter the spiritual sky and see for themselves the spiritual planets, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Therefore, the kingdom of God in the spiritual sky can be understood only through the authentic descriptions of the Vedas and Pur\u0101\u1e47as. In the material world there are three modes of material qualities \u2014 goodness, passion and ignorance \u2014 but in the spiritual world there is no trace of the modes of passion and ignorance; there is only the mode of goodness, which is uncontaminated by any tinge of ignorance or passion. In the material world, even if a person is completely in goodness, he is sometimes subject to be polluted by tinges of the modes of ignorance and passion. But in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world, the spiritual sky, only the mode of goodness in its pure form exists. The Lord and His devotees reside in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, and they are of the same transcendental quality, namely \u015buddha-sattva, the mode of pure goodness. The Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are very dear to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, and for the progressive march of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas toward the kingdom of God, the Lord Himself helps His devotees."

One time an atheistic sv\u0101m\u012b remarked, \u201cWhat is the use of watering the tulas\u012b plant? It is better to water eggplant. By watering the eggplant one can get some fruits, but what is the use of watering the tulas\u012b?\u201d These foolish creatures, unacquainted with devotional service, sometimes play havoc with the education of people in general. The most important thing about the spiritual world is that there is no envy among the devotees there. This is true even among the flowers, which are all conscious of the greatness of tulas\u012b. In the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world entered by the four Kum\u0101ras, even the birds and flowers are conscious of service to the Lord."

But the devotees of the Lord who are residents of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha have the opportunity to enjoy a transcendental situation of jewels and emeralds. Ornaments made of gold bedecked with jewels are achieved not by working hard but by the benediction of the Lord. In other words, devotees in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world, or even in this material world, cannot be poverty-stricken, as is sometimes supposed. They have ample opulences for enjoyment, but they need not labor to achieve them. It is also stated that in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world the consorts of the residents are many, many times more beautiful than we can find in this material world, even in the higher planets. It is specifically mentioned here that a woman\u2019s large hips are very attractive and they stimulate man\u2019s passion, but the wonderful feature of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha is that although the women have large hips and beautiful faces and are decorated with ornaments of emeralds and jewels, the men are so absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness that the beautiful bodies of the women cannot attract them. In other words, there is enjoyment of the association of the opposite sex, but there is no sexual relationship. The residents of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha have a better standard of pleasure, so there is no need of sex pleasure."

Such transcendentally beautiful ladies, their hands playing with lotuses and their leg bangles tinkling, are sometimes seen sweeping the marble walls, which are bedecked at intervals with golden borders, in order to receive the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Supreme Lord, Govinda, is always served in His abode by many, many millions of goddesses of fortune. Lak\u1e63m\u012b-sahasra-\u015bata-sambhrama-sevyam\u0101nam. These millions and trillions of goddesses of fortune who reside in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are not exactly consorts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but are the wives of the devotees of the Lord and also engage in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is stated here that in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets the houses are made of marble. Similarly, in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the ground on the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets is made of touchstone. Thus there is no need to sweep the stone in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, for there is hardly any dust on it, but still, in order to satisfy the Lord, the ladies there always engage in dusting the marble walls. Why? The reason is that they are eager to achieve the grace of the Lord by doing so. It is also stated here that in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets the goddesses of fortune are faultless. Generally the goddess of fortune does not remain steadily in one place. Her name is Ca\u00f1cal\u0101, which means \u201cone who is not steady.\u201d We find, therefore, that a man who is very rich may become the poorest of the poor. Another example is R\u0101va\u1e47a. R\u0101va\u1e47a took away Lak\u1e63m\u012b, S\u012bt\u0101j\u012b, to his kingdom, and instead of being happy by the grace of Lak\u1e63m\u012b, his family and his kingdom were vanquished. Thus Lak\u1e63m\u012b in the house of R\u0101va\u1e47a is Ca\u00f1cal\u0101, or unsteady. Men of R\u0101va\u1e47a\u2019s class want Lak\u1e63m\u012b only, without her husband, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; therefore they become unsteady due to Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b. Materialistic persons find fault on the part of Lak\u1e63m\u012b, but in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b is fixed in the service of the Lord. In spite of her being the goddess of fortune, she cannot be happy without the grace of the Lord. Even the goddess of fortune needs the Lord\u2019s grace in order to be happy, yet in the material world even Brahm\u0101, the highest created being, seeks the favor of Lak\u1e63m\u012b for happiness."

        "purport": " Generally, when a woman is kissed by her husband, her face becomes more beautiful. In Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha also, although the goddess of fortune is naturally as beautiful as can be imagined, she nevertheless awaits the kissing of the Lord to make her face more beautiful. The beautiful face of the goddess of fortune appears in ponds of transcendental crystal water when she worships the Lord with tulas\u012b leaves in her garden."

Such impersonalists think that the spiritual world is completely void, or, in other words, that there is no variegatedness. This mentality is described here as ku-kath\u0101 mati-ghn\u012b\u1e25, \u201cintelligence bewildered by unworthy words.\u201d The philosophies of voidness and of the impersonal situation of the spiritual world are condemned here because they bewilder one\u2019s intelligence. How can the impersonalist and the void philosopher think of this material world, which is full of variegatedness, and then say that there is no variegatedness in the spiritual world? It is said that this material world is the perverted reflection of the spiritual world, so unless there is variegatedness in the spiritual world, how can there be temporary variegatedness in the material world? That one can transcend this material world does not imply that there is no transcendental variegatedness. Here in the Bh\u0101gavatam, in this verse particularly, it is stressed that people who try to discuss and understand the real spiritual nature of the spiritual sky and the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas are fortunate. The variegatedness of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets is described in relation to the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. But instead of trying to understand the spiritual abode and the spiritual activities of the Lord, people are more interested in politics and economic developments. They hold many conventions, meetings and discussions to solve the problems of this worldly situation, where they can remain for only a few years, but they are not interested in understanding the spiritual situation of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world. If they are at all fortunate, they become interested in going back home, back to Godhead, but unless they understand the spiritual world, they rot in this material darkness continuously."

Brahm\u0101 and other demigods have much better material bodies than human beings, yet the demigods, including Brahm\u0101, nevertheless desire to attain the human form of life because it is specifically meant for the living entity who can attain transcendental knowledge and religious perfection. It is not possible to go back to Godhead in one life, but in the human form one should at least understand the goal of life and begin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is said that the human form is a great boon because it is the most suitable boat for crossing over the nescience ocean. The spiritual master is considered to be the most able captain in that boat, and the information from the scriptures is the favorable wind for floating over the ocean of nescience. The human being who does not take advantage of all these facilities in this life is committing suicide. Therefore one who does not begin K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the human form of life loses his life to the influence of the illusory energy.

        "translation": "Persons whose bodily features change in ecstasy and who breathe heavily and perspire due to hearing the glories of the Lord are promoted to the kingdom of God, even though they do not care for meditation and other austerities. The kingdom of God is above the material universes, and it is desired by Brahm\u0101 and other demigods.",
        "purport": " It is clearly stated herein that the kingdom of God is above the material universes. Just as there are many hundreds of thousands of higher planets above this earth, so there are many millions and billions of spiritual planets belonging to the spiritual sky. Brahm\u0101j\u012b states herein that the spiritual kingdom is above the kingdom of the demigods. One can enter the kingdom of the Supreme Lord only when one is highly developed in desirable qualities. All good qualities develop in the person of a devotee. It is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Fifth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter, verse 12, that anyone who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is endowed with all the good qualities of the demigods. In the material world the qualities of the demigods are highly appreciated, just as, even in our experience, the qualities of a gentleman are more highly appreciated than the qualities of a man in ignorance or in a lower condition of life. The qualities of the demigods in the higher planets are far superior to the qualities of the inhabitants of this earth. Brahm\u0101j\u012b confirms herewith that only persons who have developed the desirable qualities can enter into the kingdom of God. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, the devotee\u2019s desirable qualities are described to be twenty-six in number. They are stated as follows: He is very kind; he does not quarrel with anyone; he accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as the highest goal of life; he is equal to everyone; no one can find fault in his character; he is magnanimous, mild and always clean, internally and externally; he does not profess to possess anything in this material world; he is a benefactor to all living entities; he is peaceful and is a soul completely surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; he has no material desire to fulfill; he is meek and humble, always steady, and has conquered the sensual activities; he does not eat more than required to maintain body and soul together; he is never mad after material identity; he is respectful to all others and does not demand respect for himself; he is very grave, very compassionate and very friendly; he is poetic; he is expert in all activities; and he is silent in nonsense. Similarly, in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Third Canto, Twenty-fifth Chapter, verse 21, the qualifications of a saintly person are mentioned. It is said there that a saintly person eligible to enter into the kingdom of God is very tolerant and very kind to all living entities. He is not partial; he is kind both to human beings and to animals. He is not such a fool that he will kill a goat N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a to feed a human N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. He is very kind to all living entities; therefore he has no enemy. He is very peaceful. These are the qualities of persons who are eligible to enter into the kingdom of God. That such a person gradually becomes liberated and enters the kingdom of God is confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Fifth Canto, Fifth Chapter, verse 2. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Second Canto, Third Chapter, verse 24, also states that if a person does not cry or exhibit bodily changes after chanting the holy name of God without offense, it is to be understood that he is hardhearted and that therefore his heart does not change even after he chants the holy name of God, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These bodily changes can take place due to ecstasy when we offenselessly chant the holy names of God: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. It may be noted that there are ten offenses we should avoid. The first offense is to decry persons who try in their lives to broadcast the glories of the Lord. People must be educated in understanding the glories of the Supreme; therefore the devotees who engage in preaching the glories of the Lord are never to be decried. It is the greatest offense. Furthermore, the holy name of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the most auspicious name, and His pastimes are also nondifferent from the holy name of the Lord. There are many foolish persons who say that one can chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or chant the name of K\u0101l\u012b or Durg\u0101 or \u015aiva because they are all the same. If one thinks that the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the names and activities of the demigods are on the same level, or if one accepts the holy name of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to be a material sound vibration, that is also an offense. The third offense is to think of the spiritual master who spreads the glories of the Lord as an ordinary human being. The fourth offense is to consider the Vedic literatures, such as the Pur\u0101\u1e47as or other transcendentally revealed scriptures, to be ordinary books of knowledge. The fifth offense is to think that devotees have given artificial importance to the holy name of God. The actual fact is that the Lord is nondifferent from His name. The highest realization of spiritual value is to chant the holy name of God, as prescribed for the age \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The sixth offense is to give some interpretation on the holy name of God. The seventh offense is to act sinfully on the strength of chanting the holy name of God. It is understood that one can be freed from all sinful reaction simply by chanting the holy name of God, but if one thinks that he is therefore at liberty to commit all kinds of sinful acts, that is a symptom of offense. The eighth offense is to equate the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with other spiritual activities, such as meditation, austerity, penance or sacrifice. They cannot be equated at any level. The ninth offense is to specifically glorify the importance of the holy name before persons who have no interest. The tenth offense is to be attached to the misconception of possessing something, or to accept the body as one\u2019s self, while executing the process of spiritual cultivation. When one is free from all ten of these offenses in chanting the holy name of God, he develops the ecstatic bodily features called pulak\u0101\u015bru. Pulaka means \u201csymptoms of happiness,\u201d and a\u015bru means \u201ctears in the eyes.\u201d The symptoms of happiness and tears in the eyes must appear in a person who has chanted the holy name offenselessly. Here in this verse it is stated that those who have actually developed the symptoms of happiness and tears in the eyes by chanting the glories of the Lord are eligible to enter the kingdom of God. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that if one does not develop these symptoms while chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is to be understood that he is still offensive. Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta suggests a nice remedy in this connection. There it is said in verse 31, Chapter Eight, of \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101, that if anyone takes shelter of Lord Caitanya and just chants the holy name of the Lord, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he becomes freed from all offenses."

        "translation": "Thus the great sages Sanaka, San\u0101tana, Sanandana and Sanat-kum\u0101ra, upon reaching the above-mentioned Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha in the spiritual world by dint of their mystic yoga performance, perceived unprecedented happiness. They found that the spiritual sky was illuminated by highly decorated airplanes piloted by the best devotees of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and was predominated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is one without a second. He is above everyone. No one is equal to Him, nor is anyone greater than Him. Therefore He is described here as vi\u015bva-guru. He is the prime living entity of the entire material and spiritual creation and is bhuvanaika-vandyam, the only worshipable personality in the three worlds. The airplanes in the spiritual sky are self-illuminated and are piloted by great devotees of the Lord. In other words, in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets there is no scarcity of the things which are available in the material world; they are available, but they are more valuable because they are spiritual and therefore eternal and blissful. The sages felt an unprecedented happiness because Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha was not predominated by an ordinary man. The Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are predominated by expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who are differently named as Madhus\u016bdana, M\u0101dhava, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Pradyumna, etc. These transcendental planets are worshipable because the Personality of Godhead personally rules them. It is said here that the sages reached the transcendental spiritual sky by dint of their mystic power. That is the perfection of the yoga system. The breathing exercises and disciplines to keep health in proper order are not the ultimate goals of yoga perfection. The yoga system as generally understood is a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, or siddhi, eightfold perfection in yoga. By dint of perfection in yoga one can become lighter than the lightest and heavier than the heaviest; one can go wherever he likes and can achieve opulences as he likes. There are eight such perfections. The \u1e5b\u1e63is, the four Kum\u0101ras, reached Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha by becoming lighter than the lightest and thus passing over the space of the material world. Modern mechanical space vehicles are unsuccessful because they cannot go to the highest region of this material creation, and they certainly cannot enter the spiritual sky. But by perfection of the yoga system one not only can travel through material space, but can surpass material space and enter the spiritual sky. We learn this fact also from an incident concerning Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. It is understood that in one year Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni traveled everywhere and went into the spiritual sky to meet the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. By present standards, scientists calculate that if one could travel at the speed of light, it would take forty thousand years to reach the highest planet of this material world. But the yoga system can carry one without limitation or difficulty. The word yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 is used in this verse. Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101-balena viku\u1e47\u1e6dham. The transcendental happiness exhibited in the spiritual world and all other spiritual manifestations there are made possible by the influence of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, the internal potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

They were not at all duplicitous, and they entered the doors exactly as little children enter places without any idea of what it is to trespass. That is a child\u2019s nature. A child can enter any place, and no one checks him. Indeed, a child is generally welcome in his attempts to go places, but if it so happens that a child is checked from entering a door, he naturally becomes very sorry and angry. That is the nature of a child. In this case, the same thing happened. The childlike saintly personalities entered all the six doors of the palace, and no one checked them; therefore when they attempted to enter the seventh door and were forbidden by the doormen, who checked them with their sticks, they naturally became very angry and sorrowful. An ordinary child would cry, but because these were not ordinary children, they immediately made preparations to punish the doormen, for the doormen had committed a great offense. Even to this day a saintly person is never checked from entering anyone\u2019s door in India."

        "translation": "When the Kum\u0101ras, although by far the fittest persons, were thus forbidden entrance by the two chief doorkeepers of \u015ar\u012b Hari while other divinities looked on, their eyes suddenly turned red because of anger due to their great eagerness to see their most beloved master, \u015ar\u012b Hari, the Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " According to the Vedic system, a sanny\u0101s\u012b, a person in the renounced order of life, is dressed in saffron-colored garments. This saffron dress is practically a passport for the mendicant and sanny\u0101s\u012b to go anywhere. The sanny\u0101s\u012b\u2019s duty is to enlighten people in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those in the renounced order of life have no other business but preaching the glories and supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Vedic sociological conception is that a sanny\u0101s\u012b should not be restricted; he is allowed to go anywhere and everywhere he wants, and he is not refused any gift he might demand from a householder. The four Kum\u0101ras came to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. The word suh\u1e5bttama, \u201cbest of all friends,\u201d is important. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, He is the best friend of all living entities. Suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m. No one can be a greater well-wishing friend to any living entity than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is so kindly disposed towards everyone that in spite of our completely forgetting our relationship with the Supreme Lord, He comes Himself \u2014 sometimes personally, as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared on this earth, and sometimes as His devotee, as did Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu \u2014 and sometimes He sends His bona fide devotees to reclaim all the fallen souls. Therefore, He is the greatest well-wishing friend of everyone, and the Kum\u0101ras wanted to see Him. The doorkeepers should have known that the four sages had no other business, and therefore to restrict them from entering the palace was not apt. In this verse it is figuratively stated that the younger brother of desire suddenly appeared in person when the sages were forbidden to see their most beloved Personality of Godhead. The younger brother of desire is anger. If one\u2019s desire is not fulfilled, the younger brother, anger, follows. Here we can mark that even great saintly persons like the Kum\u0101ras were also angry, but they were not angry for their personal interests. They were angry because they were forbidden to enter the palace to see the Personality of Godhead. Therefore the theory that in the perfectional stage one should not have anger is not supported in this verse. Anger will continue even in the liberated stage. These four mendicant brothers, the Kum\u0101ras, were considered liberated persons, but still they were angry because they were restricted in their service to the Lord. The difference between the anger of an ordinary person and that of a liberated person is that an ordinary person becomes angry because his sense desires are not being fulfilled, whereas a liberated person like the Kum\u0101ras becomes angry when restricted in the discharge of duties for serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the previous verse it has been clearly mentioned that the Kum\u0101ras were liberated persons. Vidit\u0101tma-tattva means \u201cone who understands the truth of self-realization.\u201d One who does not understand the truth of self-realization is called ignorant, but one who understands the self, the Superself, their interrelation, and activities in self-realization is called vidit\u0101tma-tattva. Although the Kum\u0101ras were already liberated persons, they nevertheless became angry. This point is very important. Becoming liberated does not necessitate losing one\u2019s sensual activities. Sense activities continue even in the liberated stage. The difference is, however, that sense activities in liberation are accepted only in connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, whereas sense activities in the conditioned stage are enacted for personal sense gratification."

How are these two persons living in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha? Where is the possibility of an enemy\u2019s coming into this kingdom of God? The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no enemy. Who could be envious of Him? Probably these two persons are imposters; therefore they suspect others to be like themselves.",
        "purport": " The difference between the inhabitants of a Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet and those of a material planet is that in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha all the residents engage in the service of the Lord Himself and are equipped with all His good qualities. It has been analyzed by great personalities that when a conditioned soul is liberated and becomes a devotee, about seventy-nine percent of all the good qualities of the Lord develop in his person. Therefore in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world there is no question of enmity between the Lord and the residents. Here in this material world the citizens may be inimical to the chief executives or heads of state, but in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha there is no such mentality. One is not allowed to enter Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha unless he has completely developed the good qualities. The basic principle of goodness is to accept subordination to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The sages, therefore, were surprised to see that the two doormen who checked them from entering the palace were not exactly like the residents of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. It may be said that a doorman\u2019s duty is to determine who should be allowed to enter the palace and who should not. But that is not relevant in this matter because no one is allowed to enter the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets unless he has developed one hundred percent his mentality of devotional service to the Supreme Lord. No enemy of the Lord can enter Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. The Kum\u0101ras concluded that the only reason for the doormen\u2019s checking them was that the doormen themselves were imposters."

        "translation": "In the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world there is complete harmony between the residents and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as there is complete harmony within space between the big and the small skies. Why then is there a seed of fear in this field of harmony? These two persons are dressed like inhabitants of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, but wherefrom can their disharmony come into existence?",
        "purport": " Just as there are different departments in each state in this material world \u2014 the civil department and the criminal department \u2014 so, in God\u2019s creation, there are two departments of existence. As in the material world we find that the criminal department is far, far smaller than the civil department, so this material world, which is considered the criminal department, is one fourth of the entire creation of the Lord. All living entities who are residents of the material universes are considered to be more or less criminals because they do not wish to abide by the order of the Lord or they are against the harmonious activities of God\u2019s will. The principle of creation is that the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is by nature joyful, and He becomes many in order to enhance His transcendental joy. The living entities like ourselves, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, are meant to satisfy the senses of the Lord. Thus, whenever there is a discrepancy in that harmony, immediately the living entity is entrapped by m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion. The external energy of the Lord is called the material world, and the kingdom of the internal energy of the Lord is called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, or the kingdom of God. In the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world there is no disharmony between the Lord and the residents. Therefore God\u2019s creation in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world is perfect. There is no cause of fear. The entire kingdom of God is such a completely harmonious unit that there is no possibility of enmity. Everything there is absolute. Just as there are many physiological constructions within the body yet they work in one order for the satisfaction of the stomach, and just as in a machine there are hundreds and thousands of parts yet they run in harmony to fulfill the function of the machine, in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets the Lord is perfect, and the inhabitants also perfectly engage in the service of the Lord. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, the impersonalists, interpret this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam to mean that the small sky and the big sky are one, but this idea cannot stand. The example of the big sky and the small skies is also applicable within a person\u2019s body. The big sky is the body itself, and the intestines and other parts of the body occupy the small sky. Each and every part of the body has individuality, even though occupying a small part of the total body. Similarly, the whole creation is the body of the Supreme Lord, and we created beings, or anything that is created, are but a small part of that body. The parts of the body are never equal to the whole. This is never possible. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that the living entities, who are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are eternally parts and parcels. According to the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, the living entity in illusion considers himself part and parcel although he is actually one and the same as the supreme whole. This theory is not valid. The oneness of the whole and the part is in their quality. The qualitative oneness of the small and large portions of the sky does not imply that the small sky becomes the big sky. There is no cause for the politics of divide and rule in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets; there is no fear, because of the united interests of the Lord and the residents. M\u0101y\u0101 means disharmony between the living entities and the Supreme Lord, and Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha means harmony between them. Actually all living entities are provided for and maintained by the Lord because He is the supreme living entity. But foolish creatures, although actually under the control of the supreme living entity, defy His existence, and that state is called m\u0101y\u0101. Sometimes they deny that there is such a being as God. They say, \u201cEverything is void.\u201d And sometimes they deny Him in a different way: \u201cThere may be a God, but He has no form.\u201d Both these conceptions arise from the rebellious condition of the living entity. As long as this rebellious condition prevails, the material world will continue in disharmony. Harmony or disharmony is realized because of the law and order of a particular place. Religion is the law and order of the Supreme Lord. In the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we find that religion means devotional service, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cGive up all other religious principles and simply become a soul surrendered unto Me.\u201d This is religion. When one is fully conscious that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme enjoyer and Supreme Lord and one acts accordingly, that is real religion. Anything which goes against this principle is not religion. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cJust give up all other religious principles.\u201d In the spiritual world this religious principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is maintained in harmony, and therefore that world is called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. If the same principles can be adopted here, wholly or partially, then it is also Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. So it is with any society, such as the International Society for Krishna Consciousness: If the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, putting faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the center, live in harmony according to the order and principles of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, then they are living in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, not in this material world."

        "translation": "Therefore let us consider how these two contaminated persons should be punished. The punishment should be apt, for thus benefit can eventually be bestowed upon them. Since they find duality in the existence of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha life, they are contaminated and should be removed from this place to the material world, where the living entities have three kinds of enemies.",
        "purport": " The reason why pure souls come into the existential circumstances of the material world, which is considered to be the criminal department of the Supreme Lord, is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Seventh Chapter, verse 27. It is stated that as long as a living entity is pure, he is in complete harmony with the desires of the Supreme Lord, but as soon as he becomes impure he is in disharmony with the desires of the Lord. By contamination he is forced to transfer to this material world, where the living entities have three enemies, namely desire, anger and lust. These three enemies force the living entities to continue material existence, and when one is free from them he is eligible to enter the kingdom of God. One should not, therefore, be angry in the absence of an opportunity for sense gratification, and one should not be lusty to acquire more than necessary. In this verse it is clearly stated that the two doormen should be sent into the material world, where criminals are allowed to reside. Since the basic principles of criminality are sense gratification, anger and unnecessary lust, persons conducted by these three enemies of the living entity are never promoted to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. People should learn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the Lord of everything; they should practice satisfying the senses of the Supreme Lord instead of trying to satisfy their own senses. Training in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will help one be promoted to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha."

        "translation": "After being cursed by the sages, the doormen said: It is quite apt that you have punished us for neglecting to respect sages like you. But we pray that due to your compassion at our repentance, the illusion of forgetting the Supreme Personality of Godhead will not come upon us as we go progressively downward.",
        "purport": " To a devotee, any heavy punishment is tolerable but the one which effects forgetfulness of the Supreme Lord. The doormen, who were also devotees, could understand the punishment meted out to them, for they were conscious of the great offense they had committed by not allowing the sages to enter Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. In the lowest species of life, including the animal species, forgetfulness of the Lord is very prominent. The doormen were aware that they were going to the criminal department of the material world, and they expected that they might go to the lowest species and forget the Supreme Lord. They prayed, therefore, that this might not happen in the lives they were going to accept because of the curse. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Sixteenth Chapter, verses 19 and 20, it is said that those who are envious of the Lord and His devotees are thrown into the species of abominable life; life after life such fools are unable to remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore they continue going down and down."

The Supreme Lord cannot be seen by ordinary eyes, but He now became visible to the eyesight of the Kum\u0101ras. Another significant word is sam\u0101dhi-bh\u0101gyam. Meditators who are very fortunate can see the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form of the Lord within their hearts by following the yogic process. But to see Him face to face is a different matter. This is only possible for pure devotees. The Kum\u0101ras, therefore, upon seeing the Lord coming forward with His associates, who were holding an umbrella and a c\u0101mara fan, were struck with wonder that they were seeing the Lord face to face. It is said in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 that devotees, being elevated in love of God, always see \u015ay\u0101masundara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, within their hearts. But when they are mature, the same God is visible before them face to face. For ordinary persons the Lord is not visible; however, when one can understand the significance of His holy name and one engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord, beginning with the tongue, by chanting and tasting pras\u0101da, then gradually the Lord reveals Himself. Thus the devotee constantly sees the Lord within his heart, and, in a more mature stage, one can see the same Lord directly, as we see everything else."

The Lord\u2019s beautiful bodily color is blackish, and His broad chest is the resting place of the goddess of fortune, who glorifies the entire spiritual world, the summit of all heavenly planets. Thus it appeared that the Lord was personally spreading the beauty and good fortune of the spiritual world.",
        "purport": " When the Lord came, He was pleased with everyone; therefore it is stated here, k\u1e5btsna-pras\u0101da-sumukham. The Lord knew that even the offensive doormen were His pure devotees, although by chance they committed an offense at the feet of other devotees. To commit an offense against a devotee is very dangerous in devotional service. Lord Caitanya therefore said that an offense to a devotee is just like a mad elephant run loose; when a mad elephant enters a garden, it tramples all the plants. Similarly, an offense unto the feet of a pure devotee murders one\u2019s position in devotional service. On the part of the Lord there was no offended mood because He does not accept any offense created by His sincere devotee. But a devotee should be very cautious of committing offenses at the feet of another devotee. The Lord, being equal to all, and being especially inclined to His devotee, looked as mercifully at the offenders as at the offended. This attitude of the Lord was due to His unlimited quantity of transcendental qualities. His cheerful attitude towards the devotees was so pleasing and heart-touching that His very smile was attractive for them. That attraction was glorious not only for all the higher planets of this material world, but beyond, for the spiritual world also. Generally a human being has no idea of what the constitutional position is in the higher material planets, which are far better constituted in regard to all paraphernalia, yet the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet is so pleasing and so celestial that it is compared to the middle jewel or locket in a necklace of jewels. In this verse the words sp\u1e5bha\u1e47\u012bya-dh\u0101ma indicate that the Lord is the reservoir of all pleasure because He has all the transcendental qualities. Although only some of these are aspired for by persons who hanker after the pleasure of merging in the impersonal Brahman, there are other aspirants who want to associate with the Lord personally as His servants. The Lord is so kind that He gives shelter to everyone \u2014 both impersonalists and devotees. He gives shelter to the impersonalists in His impersonal Brahman effulgence, whereas He gives shelter to the devotees in His personal abodes known as the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas. He is especially inclined to His devotee; He touches the core of the heart of the devotee simply by smiling and glancing over him. The Lord is always served in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka by many hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune, as stated by the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (lak\u1e63m\u012b-sahasra-\u015bata-sambhrama-sevyam\u0101nam). In this material world, one is glorified if he is favored even a pinch by the goddess of fortune, so we can simply imagine how glorified is the kingdom of God in the spiritual world, where many hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune engage in the direct service of the Lord. Another feature of this verse is that it openly declares where the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas are situated. They are situated as the summit of all the heavenly planets, which are above the sun globe, at the upper limit of the universe, and are known as Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka. The spiritual world is situated beyond the universe. Therefore it is stated here that the spiritual world, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, is the summit of all planetary systems."

My dear demigods, the Lord who thus manifested Himself is worshipable by me, by Lord \u015aiva and by all of you. The sages regarded Him with unsated eyes and joyously bowed their heads at His lotus feet.",
        "purport": " The beauty of the Lord was so enchanting that it could not be sufficiently described. The goddess of fortune is supposed to be the most beautiful sight within the spiritual and material creations of the Lord; she has a sense of being the most beautiful, yet her beauty was defeated when the Lord appeared. In other words, the beauty of the goddess of fortune is secondary in the presence of the Lord. In the words of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava poets, it is said that the Lord\u2019s beauty is so enchanting that it defeats hundreds of thousands of Cupids. He is therefore called Madana-mohana. It is also described that the Lord sometimes becomes mad after the beauty of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. Poets describe that under those circumstances, although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Madana-mohana, He becomes Madana-d\u0101ha, or enchanted by the beauty of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. Actually the Lord\u2019s beauty is superexcellent, surpassing even the beauty of Lak\u1e63m\u012b in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. The devotees of the Lord in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets want to see the Lord as the most beautiful, but the devotees in Gokula or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka want to see R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b as more beautiful than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The adjustment is that the Lord, being bhakta-vatsala, or one who wants to please His devotees, assumes such features so that devotees like Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and other demigods may be pleased. Here also, for the devotee-sages, the Kum\u0101ras, the Lord appeared in His most beautiful feature, and they continued to see Him without satiation and wanted to continue seeing Him more and more."

In other words, the impersonalist who feels transcendental pleasure in striving to become one with the Lord is defeated when he sees the beautiful transcendental features of the Lord. Because of the fragrance of His lotus feet, carried by the air and mixed with the aroma of tulas\u012b, their minds changed; instead of becoming one with the Supreme Lord, they thought it wise to be devotees.

        "translation": "This is the form of the Lord which is meditated upon by the followers of the yoga process, and it is pleasing to the yog\u012bs in meditation. It is not imaginary but factual, as proved by great yog\u012bs. The Lord is full in eight kinds of achievement, but for others these achievements are not possible in full perfection.",
        "purport": " The success of the yoga process is very nicely described here. It is specifically mentioned that the form of the Lord as four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is the object of meditation for the followers of yoga-m\u0101rga. In the modern age there are so many so-called yog\u012bs who do not target their meditation on the four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form. Some of them try to meditate on something impersonal or void, but that is not approved by the great yog\u012bs who follow the standard method. The real yoga-m\u0101rga process is to control the senses, sit in a solitary and sanctified place and meditate on the four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, decorated as described in this chapter as He appeared before the four sages. This N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s expansion; therefore the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement which is now spreading is the real, topmost process of yoga practice. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the highest yoga performance by trained devotional yog\u012bs. Despite all the allurement of yoga practice, the eight kinds of yogic perfections are hardly achievable by the common man. But here it is described that the Lord, who appeared before the four sages, is Himself full of all eight of those perfections. The highest yoga-m\u0101rga process is to concentrate the mind twenty-four hours a day on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The yoga system, as described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or as recommended in the Pata\u00f1jali yoga process, is different from the nowadays-practiced ha\u1e6dha-yoga as it is generally understood in the Western countries. Real yoga practice is to control the senses and, after such control is established, to concentrate the mind on the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Personality of Godhead, and all the other Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms \u2014 with four hands decorated with conch, lotus, club and wheel \u2014 are plenary expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is recommended that one meditate upon the form of the Lord. To practice concentration of the mind, one has to sit with the head and the back in a straight line, and one must practice in a secluded place, sanctified by a sacred atmosphere. The yog\u012b should observe the rules and regulations of brahmacarya \u2014 to strictly live a life of self-restraint and celibacy. One cannot practice yoga in a congested city, living a life of extravagancy, including unrestricted sex indulgence and adultery of the tongue. Yoga practice necessitates controlling the senses, and the beginning of sense control is to control the tongue. One who can control the tongue can also have control over the other senses. One cannot allow the tongue to take all kinds of forbidden food and drink and at the same time advance in the practice of yoga. It is a very regrettable fact that many unauthorized so-called yog\u012bs come to the Western countries and exploit people\u2019s inclination towards yoga practice. Such unauthorized yog\u012bs even dare to say publicly that one can indulge in the habit of drinking and at the same time practice meditation. Five thousand years ago Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommended yoga practice to Arjuna, but Arjuna frankly expressed his inability to follow the stringent rules and regulations of the yoga system. One should be very practical in every field of activities and should not waste his valuable time in practicing useless gymnastic feats in the name of yoga. Real yoga is to search out the four-handed Supersoul within one\u2019s heart and see Him perpetually in meditation. Such continued meditation is called sam\u0101dhi, and the object of this meditation is the four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, with bodily decorations as described in this chapter of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. If, however, one wants to meditate upon something void or impersonal, it will take a very long time before he achieves success in yoga practice. We cannot concentrate our mind on something void or impersonal. Real yoga is to fix the mind on the form of the Lord, the four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a who is sitting in everyone\u2019s heart. By meditation one can understand that God is seated within one\u2019s heart. Even if one does not know it, God is seated within the heart of everyone. Not only is He seated in the heart of the human being, but He is also within the hearts of cats and dogs. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 certifies this fact by the declaration of the Lord, \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be. The \u012b\u015bvara, the supreme controller of the world, is seated in the heart of everyone. Not only is He in everyone\u2019s heart, but He is also present within the atom. No place is vacant or devoid of the presence of the Lord. That is the statement of \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad. God is present everywhere, and His right of proprietorship applies to everything. The feature of the Lord by which He is present everywhere is called Param\u0101tm\u0101. \u0100tm\u0101 means the individual soul, and Param\u0101tm\u0101 means the individual Supersoul; both \u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101 are individual persons. The difference between \u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101 is that the \u0101tm\u0101, or the soul, is present only in a particular body, whereas the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is present everywhere. In this connection, the example of the sun is very nice. An individual person may be situated in one place, but the sun, even though a similar individual entity, is present on the head of every individual person. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this is explained. Therefore even though the qualities of all entities, including the Lord, are equal, the Supersoul is different from the individual soul by quantitative power of expansion. The Lord, or the Supersoul, can expand Himself into millions of different forms, whereas the individual soul cannot do so. The Supersoul, being seated in everyone\u2019s heart, can witness everyone\u2019s activities \u2014 past, present and future. In the Upani\u1e63ads the Supersoul is described as being seated with the individual soul as friend and witness. As a friend, the Lord is always anxious to get back His friend, the individual soul, and bring him back home, back to Godhead. As a witness He is the bestower of all benedictions, and He endows each individual with the result of his actions. The Supersoul gives the individual soul all facilities to achieve whatever he desires to enjoy in this material world. Suffering is a reaction to the living entity\u2019s propensity to try to lord it over the material world. But the Lord instructs His friend, the individual soul, who is also His son, to give up all other engagements and simply surrender unto Him for perpetual bliss and an eternal life full of knowledge. This is the last instruction of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the most authorized and widely read book on all varieties of yoga. Thus the last word of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the last word in the perfection of yoga. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that a person who is always absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the topmost yog\u012b. What is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness? As the individual soul is present by his consciousness throughout his entire body, so the Supersoul, or Param\u0101tm\u0101, is present throughout the whole creation by superconsciousness. This superconscious energy is imitated by the individual soul, who has limited consciousness. I can understand what is going on within my limited body, but I cannot feel what is going on in another\u2019s body. I am present throughout my body by my consciousness, but my consciousness is not present in another\u2019s body. The Supersoul, or Param\u0101tm\u0101, however, being present everywhere and within everyone, is also conscious of everyone\u2019s existence. The theory that the soul and the Supersoul are one is not acceptable because it is not confirmed by authoritative Vedic literature. The individual soul\u2019s consciousness cannot act in superconsciousness. This superconsciousness can be achieved, however, by dovetailing individual consciousness with the consciousness of the Supreme. This dovetailing process is called surrender, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. From the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we learn very clearly that Arjuna, in the beginning, did not want to fight with his brothers and relatives, but after understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 he dovetailed his consciousness with the superconsciousness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He was then in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A person in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness acts by the dictation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, dictation is received through the transparent medium of the spiritual master. When one is sufficiently trained and acts in submissive faith and love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master, the dovetailing process becomes more firm and accurate. This stage of devotional service by the devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the most perfect stage of the yoga system. At this stage, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Supersoul, dictates from within, while from without the devotee is helped by the spiritual master, who is the bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. From within He helps the devotee as caitya, for He is seated within the heart of everyone. Understanding that God is seated within everyone\u2019s heart is not, however, sufficient. One has to be acquainted with God from both within and without, and one must take dictation from within and without to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is the highest perfectional stage of the human form of life and the topmost perfection of all yoga. For a perfect yog\u012b, there are eight kinds of superachievements: one can become lighter than air, one can become smaller than the atom, one can become bigger than a mountain, one can achieve whatever he desires, one can control like the Lord, and so on. But when one rises to the perfectional stage of receiving dictation from the Lord, that is greater than any stage of material achievements above mentioned. The breathing exercise of the yoga system which is generally practiced is just the beginning. Meditation on the Supersoul is just another step forward. But to obtain direct contact with the Supersoul and take dictation from Him is the highest perfectional stage. The breathing exercises of meditation practice were very difficult even five thousand years ago; otherwise Arjuna would not have rejected the proposal of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that he adopt this system. This Age of Kali is called the fallen age. In this age, people in general are short-living and very slow to understand self-realization or spiritual life; they are mostly unfortunate, and therefore if someone is a little bit interested in self-realization he is likely to be misguided by so many frauds. The only way to realize the perfect stage of yoga is to follow the principles of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as practiced by Lord Caitanya. This is the simplest and highest perfection of yoga practice. Lord Caitanya demonstrated this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness yoga system in a practical manner simply by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as prescribed in the Ved\u0101nta, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and many important Pur\u0101\u1e47as. The largest number of Indians follow this yoga process, and in the United States it is gradually spreading in many cities. It is very easy and practical for this age, especially for those who are serious about success in yoga. No other process of yoga can be successful in this age. The meditation process was possible in the golden age, Satya-yuga, because people in that age used to live for hundreds of thousands of years. If one wants success in practical yoga practice, it is advised that he take to the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, and he will actually feel himself making progress. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is prescribed as r\u0101ja-vidy\u0101, or the king of all erudition. Those who have taken to this most sublime bhakti-yoga system, who practice devotional service in transcendental love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can testify to its happy and easy execution. The four sages Sanaka, San\u0101tana, Sanandana and Sanat-kum\u0101ra also became attracted by the features of the Lord and the transcendental aroma of the dust of His lotus feet, as already described in verse 43. Yoga necessitates controlling the senses, and bhakti-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the process of purifying the senses. When the senses are purified, they are automatically controlled. One cannot stop the activities of the senses by artificial means, but if one purifies the senses by engaging in the service of the Lord, the senses not only can be controlled from rubbish engagement, but can be engaged in the Lord\u2019s transcendental service, as aspired to by the four sages Sanaka, San\u0101tana, Sanandana and Sanat-kum\u0101ra. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not, therefore, a manufactured concoction of the speculative mind. It is the process enjoined in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.34): man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru."

        "purport": " The so-called yog\u012bs who concentrate their mind or meditate upon the impersonal or void are described here. This verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam describes persons who are expected to be very expert yog\u012bs engaged in meditation but who do not find the Supreme Personality of Godhead seated within the heart. These persons are described here as dur\u0101tm\u0101, which means a person who has a very crooked heart, or a less intelligent person, just opposite to a mah\u0101tm\u0101, which means one who has a broad heart. Those so-called yog\u012bs who, although engaged in meditation, are not broad-hearted cannot find the four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form, even though He is seated within their heart. Although the first realization of the Supreme Absolute Truth is impersonal Brahman, one should not remain satisfied with experiencing the impersonal effulgence of the Supreme Lord. In the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad also, the devotee prays that the glaring effulgence of Brahman may be removed from his eyes so that he can see the real, personal feature of the Lord and thus satisfy himself fully. Similarly, although the Lord is not visible in the beginning because of His glaring bodily effulgence, if a devotee sincerely wants to see Him, the Lord is revealed to him. It is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the Lord cannot be seen by our imperfect eyes, He cannot be heard by our imperfect ears, and He cannot be experienced by our imperfect senses, but that if one engages in devotional service with faith and devotion, then God reveals Himself. Here the four sages Sanat-kum\u0101ra, San\u0101tana, Sanandana and Sanaka are described as actually sincere devotees. Although they had heard from their father, Brahm\u0101, about the personal feature of the Lord, only the impersonal feature, Brahman, was revealed to them. But because they were sincerely searching for the Lord, they finally saw His personal feature directly, which corresponded with the description given by their father. They thus became fully satisfied. Here they express their gratitude because although they were foolish impersonalists in the beginning, by the grace of the Lord they could now have the good fortune to see His personal feature. Another significant aspect of this verse is that the sages describe their experience of hearing from their father, Brahm\u0101, who was born of the Lord directly. In other words, the disciplic succession from the Lord to Brahm\u0101 and from Brahm\u0101 to N\u0101rada and from N\u0101rada to Vy\u0101sa, and so on, is accepted here. Because the Kum\u0101ras were sons of Brahm\u0101, they had the opportunity to learn Vedic knowledge from the disciplic succession of Brahm\u0101, and therefore, in spite of their impersonalist beginnings, they became, in the end, direct seers of the personal feature of the Lord."

This transcendental, eternal form of Your personality can be understood only by Your mercy, through unflinching devotional service, by great sages whose hearts have been purified in the devotional way.",
        "purport": " The Absolute Truth can be understood in three features \u2014 impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here it is admitted that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the last word in understanding the Absolute Truth. Even though the four Kum\u0101ras were instructed by their great learned father, Brahm\u0101, they could not actually understand the Absolute Truth. They could only understand the Supreme Absolute Truth when they personally saw the Personality of Godhead with their own eyes. In other words, if one sees or understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the other two features of the Absolute Truth, namely impersonal Brahman and localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, are also automatically understood. Therefore the Kum\u0101ras confirm: \u201cYou are the ultimate Absolute Truth.\u201d The impersonalist may argue that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead was so nicely decorated, He was therefore not the Absolute Truth. But here it is confirmed that all the variegatedness of the absolute platform is constituted of \u015buddha-sattva, pure goodness. In the material world, any quality \u2014 goodness, passion or ignorance \u2014 is contaminated. Even the quality of goodness here in the material world is not free from tinges of passion and ignorance. But in the transcendental world, only pure goodness, without any tinge of passion or ignorance, exists; therefore the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His variegated pastimes and paraphernalia are all pure sattva-gu\u1e47a. Such variegatedness in pure goodness is exhibited eternally by the Lord for the satisfaction of the devotee. The devotee does not want to see the Supreme Personality of Absolute Truth in voidness or impersonalism. In one sense, absolute transcendental variegatedness is meant only for the devotees, not for others, because this distinct feature of transcendental variegatedness can be understood only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord and not by mental speculation or the ascending process. It is said that one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead when one is even slightly favored by Him; otherwise, without His mercy, a man may speculate for thousands of years and not understand what is actually the Absolute Truth. This mercy can be perceived by the devotee when he is completely freed from contamination. It is stated, therefore, that only when all contamination is rooted out and the devotee is completely detached from material attractions can he receive this mercy of the Lord."

Such persons do not care even for the highest material benediction, namely liberation, to say nothing of other less important benedictions like the material happiness of the heavenly kingdom.",
        "purport": " The transcendental bliss enjoyed by the devotees of the Lord is completely different from the material happiness enjoyed by less intelligent persons. The less intelligent persons in the material world are engaged by the four principles of benediction called dharma, artha, k\u0101ma and mok\u1e63a. Generally they prefer to take to religious life to achieve some material benediction, the purpose of which is to satisfy the senses. When, by that process, they become confused or frustrated in fulfilling the maximum amount of sense enjoyment, they try to become one with the Supreme, which is, according to their conception, mukti, or liberation. There are five kinds of liberation, the least important of which is called s\u0101yujya, to become one with the Supreme. Devotees don\u2019t care for such liberation because they are actually intelligent. Nor are they inclined to accept any of the other four kinds of liberation, namely to live on the same planet as the Lord, to live with Him side by side as an associate, to have the same opulence, or to attain the same bodily features. They are concerned only with glorifying the Supreme Lord and His auspicious activities. Pure devotional service is \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam. Pure devotees, who take transcendental pleasure in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, do not care for any kind of liberation; even if they are offered the five liberations, they refuse to accept them, as stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam in the Third Canto. Materialistic persons aspire for the sense enjoyment of heavenly pleasure in the heavenly kingdom, but devotees reject such material pleasure at once. The devotee does not even care for the post of Indra. A devotee knows that any pleasurable material position is subject to be annihilated at a certain point. Even if one reaches the post of Indra, Candra, or any other demigod, he must be dissolved at a certain stage. A devotee is never interested in such temporary pleasure. From Vedic scriptures it is understood that sometimes even Brahm\u0101 and Indra fall down, but a devotee in the transcendental abode of the Lord never falls. This transcendental stage of life, in which one feels transcendental pleasure in hearing the Lord\u2019s pastimes, is also recommended by Lord Caitanya. When Lord Caitanya was talking with R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya, there were varieties of suggestions offered by R\u0101m\u0101nanda regarding spiritual realization, but Lord Caitanya rejected all but one \u2014 that one should hear the glories of the Lord in association with pure devotees. That is acceptable for everyone, especially in this age. One should engage himself in hearing from pure devotees about the activities of the Lord. That is considered the supreme benediction for mankind."

        "purport": " The four sages now offer their humility to the Personality of Godhead because of their having been haughty in cursing two other devotees of the Lord. Jaya and Vijaya, the two doorkeepers who checked them from entering the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet, were certainly offenders, but as Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, the four sages should not have cursed them in anger. After the incident, they became conscious that they had done wrong by cursing the devotees of the Lord, and they prayed to the Lord that even in the hellish condition of life their minds might not be distracted from the engagement of service to the lotus feet of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Those who are devotees of the Lord are not afraid of any condition of life, provided there is constant engagement in the service of the Lord. It is said of the n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-para, or those who are devotees of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, na kuta\u015bcana bibhyati (Bh\u0101g. 6.17.28). They are not afraid of entering a hellish condition, for since they are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, heaven or hell is the same for them. In material life both heaven and hell are one and the same because they are material; in either place there is no engagement in the Lord\u2019s service. Therefore those who are engaged in the service of the Lord see no distinction between heaven and hell; it is only the materialists who prefer one to the other. These four devotees prayed to the Lord that although they might go to hell because they had cursed devotees, they might not forget the service of the Lord. The transcendental loving service of the Lord is performed in three ways \u2014 with the body, with the mind and with words. Here the sages pray that their words may always be engaged in glorifying the Supreme Lord. One may speak very nicely with ornamental language or one may be expert at controlled grammatical presentation, but if one\u2019s words are not engaged in the service of the Lord, they have no flavor and no actual use. The example is given here of tulas\u012b leaves. The tulas\u012b leaf is very useful even from the medicinal or antiseptic point of view. It is considered sacred and is offered to the lotus feet of the Lord. The tulas\u012b leaf has numerous good qualities, but if it were not offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, tulas\u012b could not be of much value or importance. Similarly, one may speak very nicely from the rhetorical or grammatical point of view, which may be very much appreciated by a materialistic audience, but if one\u2019s words are not offered to the service of the Lord, they are useless. The holes of the ears are very small and can be filled with any insignificant sound, so how can they receive as great a vibration as the glorification of the Lord? The answer is that the holes of the ears are like the sky. As the sky can never be filled up, the quality of the ear is such that one may go on pouring in vibrations of various kinds, yet it is capable of receiving more and more vibrations. A devotee is not afraid of going to hell if he has the opportunity to hear the glories of the Lord constantly. This is the advantage of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. One may be put in any condition, but God gives him the prerogative to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In any condition of life, if one goes on chanting he will never be unhappy."

        "translation": "O Lord, we therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto Your eternal form as the Personality of Godhead, which You have so kindly manifested before us. Your supreme, eternal form cannot be seen by unfortunate, less intelligent persons, but we are so much satisfied in our mind and vision to see it.",
        "purport": " The four sages were impersonalists in the beginning of their spiritual life, but afterwards, by the grace of their father and spiritual master, Brahm\u0101, they understood the eternal, spiritual form of the Lord and felt completely satisfied. In other words, the transcendentalists who aspire to the impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 are not fully satisfied and still hanker for more. Even if they are satisfied in their minds, still, transcendentally, their eyes are not satisfied. But as soon as such persons come to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are satisfied in all respects. In other words, they become devotees and want to see the form of the Lord continually. It is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 that one who has developed transcendental love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by smearing his eyes with the ointment of love sees constantly the eternal form of the Lord. The particular word used in this connection, an\u0101tman\u0101m, signifies those who have no control over the mind and senses and who therefore speculate and want to become one with the Lord. Such persons cannot have the pleasure of seeing the eternal form of the Lord. For the impersonalists and the so-called yog\u012bs, the Lord is always hidden by the curtain of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 says that even when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was seen by everyone while He was present on the surface of the earth, the impersonalists and the so-called yog\u012bs could not see Him because they were devoid of devotional eyesight. The theory of the impersonalists and so-called yog\u012bs is that the Supreme Lord assumes a particular form when He comes in touch with m\u0101y\u0101, although actually He has no form. This very conception of the impersonalists and so-called yog\u012bs checks them from seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is. The Lord, therefore, is always beyond the sight of such nondevotees. The four sages felt so much obliged to the Lord that they offered their respectful obeisances unto Him again and again."
