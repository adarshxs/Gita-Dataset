They were all His sons and grandsons and were given complete protection by the paternal affection of the Lord. How they could be vanquished in the presence of the Lord is answered in this verse: everything was done by the Lord Himself (sv\u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101y\u0101\u1e25). The Lord\u2019s family members were either incarnations of His plenary expansions or demigods from the heavenly planets, and thus before His departure He separated them by His internal potency. Before being dispatched to their respective abodes, they were sent to the holy place of Prabh\u0101sa, where they performed pious activities and took food and drink to their heart\u2019s content. It was then arranged for them to be sent back to their abodes so that others could see that the powerful Yadu dynasty was no longer in the world. In the previous verse, the word anuj\u00f1\u0101ta, indicating that the whole sequence of events was arranged by the Lord, is significant. These particular pastimes of the Lord are not a manifestation of His external energy, or material nature. Such an exhibition of His internal potency is eternal, and therefore one should not conclude that the Yadus and Bhojas died in a drunken state in an ordinary fratricidal war. \u015ar\u012b J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b comments on these incidents as magical performances."

His legs and their energies are the material ingredients, which are five in all: earth, water, fire, air and sky. The material energies represented by the banyan tree are all products of His external potency and are therefore kept to His back. And because this particular universe is the smallest of all, the banyan tree is therefore designated as small, or as a child.

The Lord was now prepared to leave this particular universe and go into another, just as the sun rises on one particular planet and sets in another simultaneously but does not change its own situation."

        "purport": " Uddhava is one of the eternal associates of the Lord, and a plenary portion of Uddhava was one of the eight Vasus in the days of yore. The eight Vasus and the demigods in the upper planetary system, who are responsible for the management of the universal affairs, performed a sacrifice in the days of yore, desiring to fulfill their respective ultimate goals in life. At that time an expansion of Uddhava, acting as one of the Vasus, desired to become an associate of the Lord. The Lord knew this because He is present in the heart of every living entity as Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Superconsciousness. In everyone\u2019s heart there is the representation of the Superconsciousness, who gives memory to the partial consciousness of every living entity. The living entity, as partial consciousness, forgets incidents of his past life, but the Superconsciousness reminds him how to act in terms of his past cultivation of knowledge. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms this fact in various ways: ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham (Bg. 4.11), sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6do matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca (Bg. 15.15). Everyone is at liberty to desire as he likes, but the desire is fulfilled by the Supreme Lord. Everyone is independent to think or desire, but the fulfillment of one\u2019s desire depends on the supreme will. This law is expressed as \u201cMan proposes, God disposes.\u201d In the days of yore, when the demigods and Vasus performed sacrifice, Uddhava, as one of the Vasus, desired to enter into the association of the Lord, which is very difficult for those busy in empiric philosophical speculation or fruitive activities. Such persons have practically no information of the facts about becoming an associate of the Lord. Only the pure devotees can know, by the mercy of the Lord, that the personal association of the Lord is the highest perfection of life. The Lord assured Uddhava that He would fulfill his desire. It appears that when the Lord informed him by His indication to Uddhava, the great sage Maitreya finally became aware of the importance of entering into the association of the Lord."

The sun does not appear or disappear in the sky; it is only in the experience of men that in the morning the sun rises and in the evening the sun sets. The Lord is simultaneously both in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and everywhere within and without Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha."

        "translation": "My Lord, even the learned sages become disturbed in their intelligence when they see that Your Greatness engages in fruitive work although You are free from all desires, that You take birth although You are unborn, that You flee out of fear of the enemy and take shelter in a fort although You are the controller of invincible time, and that You enjoy householder life surrounded by many women although You enjoy in Your Self.",
        "purport": " Pure devotees of the Lord are not very much concerned with philosophical speculation in regard to transcendental knowledge of the Lord. Nor is it possible to acquire complete knowledge of the Lord. Whatever little knowledge they have about the Lord is sufficient for them because devotees are simply satisfied in hearing and chanting about the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. This gives them all transcendental bliss. But some of the pastimes of the Lord appear contradictory, even to such pure devotees, and thus Uddhava asked the Lord about some of the contradictory incidents in His pastimes. The Lord is described as having nothing to do personally, and it is actually so because even in the creation and sustenance of the material world, the Lord has nothing to do. It seems contradictory, then, to hear that the Lord personally lifts the Govardhana Hill for the protection of His unalloyed devotees. The Lord is the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead appearing like a man, but Uddhava had doubts whether He could have so many transcendental activities. There is no difference between the Personality of Godhead and the impersonal Brahman. How then can the Lord have so many things to do, whereas the impersonal Brahman is stated to have nothing to do either materially or spiritually? If the Lord is ever unborn, how then is He born as the son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b? He is fearful even to k\u0101la, the supreme fear, and yet the Lord is afraid of fighting Jar\u0101sandha and takes shelter in a fort. How can one who is full in Himself take pleasure in the association of many women? How can He take wives and, just like a householder, take pleasure in the association of family members, children, relatives and parents? All these apparently contradictory happenings bewilder even the greatest learned scholars, who, thus bewildered, cannot understand whether inactivity is a fact or whether His activities are only imitations. The solution is that the Lord has nothing to do with anything mundane. All His activities are transcendental. This cannot be understood by the mundane speculators. For the mundane speculators there is certainly a kind of bewilderment, but for the transcendental devotees there is nothing astonishing in this. The Brahman conception of the Absolute Truth is certainly the negation of all mundane activities, but the Parabrahman conception is full with transcendental activities. One who knows the distinctions between the conception of Brahman and the conception of Supreme Brahman is certainly the real transcendentalist. There is no bewilderment for such transcendentalists. The Lord Himself also declares in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.2), \u201cEven the great sages and demigods can know hardly anything about My activities and transcendental potencies.\u201d The right explanation of the Lord\u2019s activities is given by Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva (Bh\u0101g. 1.9.16) as follows:"

        "purport": " Uddhava was never actually bewildered, but he says that all these contradictions appear to be bewildering. The whole discussion between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Uddhava was meant for the benefit of Maitreya, who was sitting nearby. The Lord used to call Uddhava for consultation when the city was attacked by Jar\u0101sandha and others and when He executed great sacrifices as part of His routine royal work as Lord of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. The Lord has no past, present and future because He is unhampered by the influence of eternal time and thus nothing is hidden from Him. He is eternally self-intelligent. Therefore His calling for Uddhava to give Him enlightenment is certainly astonishing. All these actions of the Lord appear to be contradictory, although there is no contradiction in the routine activities of the Lord. Therefore it is better to see them as they are and not attempt to explain them."

When the Lord explained His specific transcendental situation, it was meant for Uddhava only, and therefore Uddhava particularly said mahyam (\u201cunto me\u201d), although the great sage Maitreya was also sitting there. Such a transcendental situation is hardly understood by those whose devotion is mixed with speculative knowledge or fruitive activities. The Lord\u2019s activities in confidential love are very rarely disclosed to the general devotees who are attracted by devotion mixed with knowledge and mysticism. Such activities are the inconceivable pastimes of the Lord."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012b Uddhava\u2019s actual life is the direct symbol of the catu\u1e25-\u015blok\u012b Bh\u0101gavatam enunciated first to Brahm\u0101j\u012b by the Personality of Godhead. These four very great and important verses from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam are particularly taken out by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b speculators, who construe a different purport to suit their impersonal view of monism. Here is the proper answer to such unauthorized speculators. The verses of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam are purely theistic science understandable by the postgraduate students of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The unauthorized dry speculators are offenders at the lotus feet of the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they distort the purports of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam to mislead the public and prepare a direct path to the hell known as Andha-t\u0101misra. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.20) such envious speculators are without knowledge and are surely condemned life after life. They unnecessarily take shelter of \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, but he was not so drastic as to commit an offense at the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya preached the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy for a particular purpose. Such a philosophy was necessary to defeat the Buddhist philosophy of the nonexistence of the spirit soul, but it was never meant for perpetual acceptance. It was an emergency. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was accepted by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in his commentation on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Since he was a great devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he did not dare write any commentary on \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam because that would have been a direct offense at the lotus feet of the Lord. But later speculators, in the name of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy, unnecessarily make their commentary on the catu\u1e25-\u015blok\u012b Bh\u0101gavatam without any bona fide intent. The monistic dry speculators have no business in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam because this particular Vedic literature is forbidden for them by the great author himself. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva has definitely forbidden persons engaged in religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, finally, salvation, from trying to understand \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which is not meant for them (Bh\u0101g. 1.1.2). \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the great commentator on \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, has definitely forbidden the salvationists or monists to deal in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. It is not for them. Yet such unauthorized persons perversely try to understand \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and thus they commit offenses at the feet of the Lord, which even \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya dared not do. Thus they prepare for their continuation of miserable life. It should be particularly noted herein that Uddhava studied the catu\u1e25-\u015blok\u012b Bh\u0101gavatam directly from the Lord, who spoke them first to Brahm\u0101j\u012b, and this time the Lord explained more confidentially the self-knowledge mentioned as the param\u0101\u1e41 sthitim. Upon learning such self-knowledge of love, Uddhava felt very much aggrieved by feelings of separation from the Lord. Unless one is awakened to the stage of Uddhava \u2014 everlastingly feeling the separation of the Lord in transcendental love, as exhibited by Lord Caitanya also \u2014 one cannot understand the real import of the four essential verses of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. One should not indulge in the unauthorized act of twisting the meaning and thereby putting himself on the dangerous path of offense."

        "purport": " Badarik\u0101\u015brama in the Him\u0101layas, the abode of the Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a sages, is a great place of pilgrimage for the Hindus. Even up to the present, hundreds and thousands of pious Hindus go to pay respects to the incarnation of Godhead Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. It appears that even five thousand years ago this holy place was being visited by such a holy being as Uddhava, and even at that time the place was known to be very, very old. This particular pilgrimage site is very difficult to visit for ordinary men because of its difficult situation in the Him\u0101layas in a place which is covered by ice almost all year. A few months during the summer season people can visit this place at great personal inconvenience. There are four dh\u0101mas, or kingdoms of God, which represent the planets of the spiritual sky, which consists of the brahmajyoti and the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas. These are Badarik\u0101\u015brama, Rame\u015bvara, Jagann\u0101tha Pur\u012b and Dv\u0101rak\u0101. Faithful Hindus still visit all these holy places for perfection of spiritual realization, following in the footsteps of devotees like Uddhava."

As it is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, due to our long association with bodily relationships, bereavement on account of the annihilation of friends and relatives is not at all astonishing, but one has to learn the art of subduing such bereavement with higher, transcendental knowledge. The talks between Uddhava and Vidura on the topic of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a began at sunset, and Vidura was now further advanced in knowledge due to his association with Uddhava."

        "purport": " The servants of the Lord are actually the servants of society. They have no interest in human society other than to enlighten it in transcendental knowledge; they are interested in imparting knowledge of the relationship of the living being with the Supreme Lord, the activities in that transcendental relationship, and the ultimate goal of human life. That is the real knowledge which can help society achieve the real aim of human welfare. Knowledge in the matter of the bodily necessities of eating, sleeping, mating and fearing, transformed into various branches of advancement of knowledge, is all temporary. A living being is not the material body but an eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Being, and thus revival of his self-knowledge is essential. Without this knowledge, the human life is baffled. The servants of the Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, are entrusted with this responsible work, and so they wander over the earth and to all other planets in the universe. Thus the knowledge which was received by Uddhava directly from the Lord deserves to be distributed in human society, especially to persons like Vidura, who are highly advanced in the devotional service of the Lord. Real transcendental knowledge descends in the disciplic succession from the Lord to Uddhava, from Uddhava to Vidura and so on. Such supreme transcendental knowledge is not possible to achieve by the process of imperfect speculation as performed by the so-called learned mundane wranglers. Vidura was anxious to know from Uddhava that confidential knowledge known as param\u0101\u1e41 sthitim, in which the Lord is known by His transcendental pastimes. Although Vidura was older than Uddhava, he was anxious to become a servant of Uddhava in the transcendental relationship. This formula of transcendental disciplic succession is taught by Lord Caitanya also. Lord Caitanya advises that one receive transcendental knowledge from anyone \u2014 whether a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or a \u015b\u016bdra, a householder or a sanny\u0101s\u012b \u2014 provided that the person is factually conversant with the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A person who knows the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is factually a bona fide spiritual master."

        "purport": " Although one may be well versed in the transcendental science, one should be careful about the offense of mary\u0101d\u0101-vyatikrama, or impertinently surpassing a greater personality. According to scriptural injunction one should be very careful of transgressing the law of mary\u0101d\u0101-vyatikrama because by so doing one loses his duration of life, his opulence, fame and piety and the blessings of all the world. To be well versed in the transcendental science necessitates awareness of the techniques of spiritual science. Uddhava, being well aware of all these technicalities of transcendental science, advised Vidura to approach Maitreya \u1e5a\u1e63i to receive transcendental knowledge. Vidura wanted to accept Uddhava as his spiritual master, but Uddhava did not accept the post because Vidura was as old as Uddhava\u2019s father and therefore Uddhava could not accept him as his disciple, especially when Maitreya was present nearby. The rule is that in the presence of a higher personality one should not be very eager to impart instructions, even if one is competent and well versed. So Uddhava decided to send an elderly person like Vidura to Maitreya, another elderly person, but he was well versed also because he was directly instructed by the Lord while He was about to quit this mortal world. Since both Uddhava and Maitreya were directly instructed by the Lord, both had the authority to become the spiritual master of Vidura or anyone else, but Maitreya, being elderly, had the first claim to becoming the spiritual master, especially for Vidura, who was much older than Uddhava. One should not be eager to become a spiritual master cheaply for the sake of profit and fame, but should become a spiritual master only for the service of the Lord. The Lord never tolerates the impertinence of mary\u0101d\u0101-vyatikrama. One should never pass over the honor due to an elderly spiritual master in the interests of one\u2019s own personal gain and fame. Impertinence on the part of the pseudo spiritual master is very risky to progressive spiritual realization."

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012b J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, nidhanam means the transcendental abode of the Lord. Ni means the highest, and dhanam means opulence. And because the abode of the Lord is the highest manifestation of transcendental opulence, His abode can therefore be called nidhanam. Apart from the grammatical elucidation, the real purpose of the word nidhanam is to indicate that all the members of the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i and Bhoja dynasties were direct associates of the Lord, and after the end of His pastimes, all the associates were dispatched to their respective positions in the transcendental abode. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura elucidates the meaning of \u0101k\u1e5btim as pastimes. \u0100 means complete, and k\u1e5btim means transcendental pastimes. Since the Lord is identical with His transcendental body, there is no question of His changing or quitting His body. To act in accordance with the rules and customs of the material world, the Lord seems to take His birth or leave His body, but the pure devotees of the Lord know well the actual fact. It is necessary, therefore, for the serious students of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam to follow the notes and comments of the great \u0101c\u0101ryas like J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b. To others, who are not devotees of the Lord, the comments and explanations of such \u0101c\u0101ryas may appear to be grammatical jugglery, but to the students who are in the line of disciplic succession, the explanations of the great \u0101c\u0101ryas are quite fit. The word upagate\u1e63u is also significant. All the members of V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i and Bhoja directly reached the abode of the Lord. Other devotees do not reach the abode of the Lord directly, but the pure associates of the Lord have no attraction for the opulence of any planets of the material world. Sometimes, due to inquisitiveness, devotees who are to be promoted to the abode of the Lord have some attraction for the opulence of the higher material planets above the earth, and thus they desire to see them while going up to the perfection. But the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is and Bhojas were directly dispatched because they had no attraction for material planets. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also suggests that according to the Amara-ko\u015ba dictionary, \u0101k\u1e5bti also means \u201csignal.\u201d Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ordered Uddhava by signal to go to Badarik\u0101\u015brama after His departure, and Uddhava, as a pure devotee of the Lord, carried out the order more faithfully than going back to Godhead, or the abode of the Lord. That was the cause of his remaining alone even after the departure of the Lord from the face of the earth."

He wanted to disappear from the face of the earth after dispatching His excessively numerous family members. He thought to Himself as follows.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word tyak\u1e63yan is very significant in relation to Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s leaving His body. Since He is the eternal form of existence, knowledge and bliss, His body and His Self are identical. Therefore how is it possible that He would leave His body and then disappear from the vision of the world? There is a great controversy amongst the nondevotees or M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs about the mysterious disappearance of the Lord, and the doubts of those men with a poor fund of knowledge have been very elaborately cleared by \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sandarbha. According to Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the Lord has many forms. It is stated therein that the Lord has innumerable forms, and when He appears within the vision of the living entities, as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a actually appeared, all such forms amalgamate with Him. Besides all these infallible forms, He has His universal form, as manifested before Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Here in this verse the word sph\u012btam is also used, which indicates that He left His gigantic universal form called the vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa, not His primeval, eternal form, because there is hardly any possibility of His changing His form of sac-cid-\u0101nanda. This simple understanding is at once realized by the devotees of the Lord, but those who are nondevotees, who perform hardly any devotional service to the Lord, either do not understand this simple fact or purposely raise a controversy to defeat the eternity of the transcendental body of the Lord. This is due to the defect called the cheating propensity of the imperfect living entities. By practical experience also, it is seen, up to the present day, that the Lord\u2019s transcendental form is worshiped by devotees in different temples, and all the devotees of the Lord factually realize that the form of the Deity in the temple is nondifferent from the form of the Lord. This inconceivable performance of the internal potency of the Lord is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.25): n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sarvasya yoga-m\u0101y\u0101-sam\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25. The Lord reserves the right of not being exposed to everyone. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said, ata\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101m\u0101di na bhaved gr\u0101hyam indriyai\u1e25. The name and form of the Lord cannot be perceived by the material senses, but when He appears within the vision of the mundane people He assumes the form of the vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa. This is an additional material exhibition of form and is supported by the logic of a subject and its adjectives. In grammar, when an adjective is taken away from the subject, the subject it modifies does not change. Similarly, when the Lord quits His vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa, His eternal form does not change, although there is no material difference between Himself and any one of His innumerable forms. In the Fifth Canto it will be seen how the Lord is worshiped in different planets in His different forms, even now, and how He is worshiped in different temples of this earth also. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura have very elaborately explained this incident of the Lord\u2019s disappearance in their commentaries, quoting various authentic versions of Vedic literatures. We purposely do not include them all here to avoid an increase in the volume of this book. The entire matter is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, as quoted above: the Lord reserves the right of not being exposed to everyone. He always keeps Himself out of the vision of the nondevotees, who are devoid of love and devotion, and thus He puts them still further away from the Lord. The Lord appeared on the invitation of Brahm\u0101, who prayed before the K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and therefore when the Lord appeared, all the forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u amalgamated with Him, and when the mission was fulfilled, all of them disintegrated from Him in the usual course."

Transcendental knowledge has three departmental divisions, namely knowledge of impersonal Brahman, knowledge of the all-pervading Supersoul and knowledge of the Personality of Godhead. Out of the three, transcendental knowledge of the Personality of Godhead has special significance and is known as bhagavat-tattva-vij\u00f1\u0101na, specific knowledge of the Personality of Godhead. This specific knowledge is realized by pure devotional service and no other means. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55) confirms this: bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25. \u201cOnly persons engaged in devotional service can factually know the transcendental position of the Lord.\u201d Uddhava was considered to be the best amongst all devotees of that time, and therefore he was directly instructed by the Lord\u2019s grace, so that people might take advantage of Uddhava\u2019s knowledge after the disappearance of the Lord from the vision of the world. This is one of the reasons why Uddhava was advised to go to Badarik\u0101\u015brama, where the Lord is personally represented by the Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a Deity. One who is transcendentally advanced can gain direct inspiration from the temple Deity, and thus a devotee of the Lord always takes shelter of a recognized temple of the Lord in order to make tangible advancement in transcendental knowledge by the grace of the Lord."

The highest qualification of a person in the material world is to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. But since a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is in the mode of goodness, to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is not sufficient for becoming a representative of the Lord. One has to transcend the mode of goodness also and be situated in unalloyed goodness, unaffected by any of the qualities of material nature. This stage of transcendental qualification is called \u015buddha-sattva, or vasudeva, and in this stage the science of God can be realized. As the Lord is not affected by the modes of material nature, so a pure devotee of the Lord is also not affected by the modes of nature. That is the primary qualification for being one with the Lord. A person who is able to attain this transcendental qualification is called j\u012bvan-mukta, or liberated, even though he is apparently in material conditions. This liberation is achieved by one who constantly engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. In Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.187) it is stated: \u201cAnyone who, by his actions, mind and words, lives only for the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is certainly a liberated soul, even though he may appear to be in a condition of material existence.\u201d Uddhava was in such a transcendental position, and thus he was selected to be the factual representative of the Lord in His bodily absence from the vision of the world. Such a devotee of the Lord is never affected by material strength, intelligence or even renunciation. Such a devotee of the Lord can withstand all onslaughts of material nature, and therefore he is known as gosv\u0101m\u012b. Only such gosv\u0101m\u012bs can penetrate the mysteries of the Lord\u2019s transcendental loving relationships."

        "purport": " Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is factually the spiritual master of the three worlds, and He is the original source of all Vedic knowledge. It is very difficult, however, to understand the personal feature of the Absolute Truth, even from the Vedas. His personal instructions are needed in order to understand the Personality of Godhead as the Supreme Absolute Truth. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the evidence of such transcendental knowledge in gist. One cannot know the Supreme Lord unless one is graced by the Lord Himself. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibited this specific mercy towards Arjuna and Uddhava while He was in the material world. Undoubtedly Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken by the Lord on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra just to encourage Arjuna to fight, and yet to complete the transcendental knowledge of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord instructed Uddhava. The Lord wanted Uddhava to fulfill His mission and disseminate knowledge which He had not spoken even in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Persons who are attached to the words of the Vedas may also know from this verse that the Lord is the source of all Vedic knowledge. One who is unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by going through the pages of the Vedas may take shelter of one of the Lord\u2019s devotees, such as Uddhava, in order to advance further in knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 says that it is very difficult to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the Vedas, but He is easily understood from a pure devotee like Uddhava. Taking mercy on the great sages who lived at Badarik\u0101\u015brama, the Lord authorized Uddhava to speak on His behalf. Unless one has such authorization, one cannot understand or preach the devotional service of the Lord. While present on this earth, the Lord executed many uncommon activities, even traveling in space to bring down the p\u0101rij\u0101ta from heaven and recovering the son of His teacher (S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni) from the regions of death. Uddhava was certainly informed of the conditions of life on other planets, and all the sages were anxious to know of them, just as we are anxious to know about the planets in space. Uddhava was particularly deputed to carry a message to Badarik\u0101\u015brama, not only to the sages of that place of pilgrimage but also to the Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a Deities. Such a message must have been more confidential than the knowledge described in the pages of the Vedas. The Lord is undoubtedly the source of all knowledge, and the messages dispatched through Uddhava to Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and other sages were also part of the Vedic knowledge, but they were more confidential and could be sent or understood only through such a pure devotee as Uddhava. Since such confidential knowledge was known only to the Lord and Uddhava, it is said that Uddhava was as good as the Lord Himself. Every living entity can, like Uddhava, also become a confidential messenger on the same level as the Lord, provided he becomes confidential himself by dint of loving devotional service. Such confidential knowledge is entrusted, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, only to pure devotees like Uddhava and Arjuna, and one has to learn the mystery through them, and not otherwise. One cannot understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam without the help of such confidential devotees of the Lord. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, that confidential message must have concerned the mystery of His departure and the annihilation of His dynasty after the end of His appearance in the mundane world for one hundred years. Everyone must have been very anxious to know about the mystery of the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty, and that message must have been explained by the Lord to Uddhava and dispatched to Badarik\u0101\u015brama for the information of Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and other pure devotees of the Lord."

        "purport": " The subject matter of the appearance and disappearance of the Supersoul, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is a mystery even for the great sages. The word param\u0101tmana\u1e25 is significant in this verse. An ordinary living being is generally called the \u0101tm\u0101, but Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is never an ordinary living being because He is param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supersoul. Yet His appearance as one of the human beings and His disappearance again from the mortal world are subject matters for the research workers who execute research work with great perseverance. Such subject matters are certainly of increasing interest because the researchers have to search out the transcendental abode of the Lord, which He enters after finishing His pastimes in the mortal world. But even the great sages have no information that beyond the material sky is the spiritual sky where \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a eternally resides with His associates, although at the same time He exhibits His pastimes in the mortal world in all the universes one after another. This fact is confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37): goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25. \u201cThe Lord, by His inconceivable potency, resides in His eternal abode, Goloka, yet at the same time, as the Supersoul, He is present everywhere \u2014 in both the spiritual and material skies \u2014 by His multivarieties of manifestation.\u201d Therefore His appearance and disappearance are simultaneously going on, and no one can say definitely which of them is the beginning and which is the end. His eternal pastimes have no beginning or end, and one has to learn of them from the pure devotee only and not waste valuable time in so-called research work."

As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.15), the miscreants who are simply concerned with material enjoyment, who work very hard like beasts of burden, can hardly know the Personality of Godhead at any stage due to \u0101surika-bh\u0101va, or a spirit of revolt against the Supreme Lord. The transcendental bodily expansions manifested by the Lord for His pastimes in the mortal world, and the appearance and disappearance of such transcendental expansions, are difficult subject matters, and those who are not devotees are advised not to discuss the Lord\u2019s appearance and disappearance, lest they commit further offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord.
