        "translation": "The Personality of Godhead said: Under the supervision of the Supreme Lord and according to the result of his work, the living entity, the soul, is made to enter into the womb of a woman through the particle of male semen to assume a particular type of body.",
        "purport": " As stated in the last chapter, after suffering different kinds of hellish conditions, a man comes again to the human form of body. The same topic is continued in this chapter. In order to give a particular type of human form to a person who has already suffered hellish life, the soul is transferred to the semen of a man who is just suitable to become his father. During sexual intercourse, the soul is transferred through the semen of the father into the mother\u2019s womb in order to produce a particular type of body. This process is applicable to all embodied living entities, but it is especially mentioned for the man who was transferred to the Andha-t\u0101misra hell. After suffering there, when he who has had many types of hellish bodies, like those of dogs and hogs, is to come again to the human form, he is given the chance to take his birth in the same type of body from which he degraded himself to hell. Everything is done by the supervision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Material nature supplies the body, but it does so under the direction of the Supersoul. It is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that a living entity is wandering in this material world on a chariot made by material nature. The Supreme Lord, as Supersoul, is always present with the individual soul. He directs material nature to supply a particular type of body to the individual soul according to the result of his work, and the material nature supplies it. Here one word, reta\u1e25-ka\u1e47\u0101\u015braya\u1e25, is very significant because it indicates that it is not the semen of the man that creates life within the womb of a woman; rather, the living entity, the soul, takes shelter in a particle of semen and is then pushed into the womb of a woman. Then the body develops. There is no possibility of creating a living entity without the presence of the soul simply by sexual intercourse. The materialistic theory that there is no soul and that a child is born simply by material combination of the sperm and ovum is not very feasible. It is unacceptable."

In this way the child is fed by the mother\u2019s intestine within the womb and grows from day to day. The statement of the M\u0101rka\u1e47\u1e0deya Pur\u0101\u1e47a about the child\u2019s situation within the womb is exactly corroborated by modern medical science, and thus the authority of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as cannot be disproved, as is sometimes attempted by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers. Since the child depends completely on the assimilated foodstuff of the mother, during pregnancy there are restrictions on the food taken by the mother. Too much salt, chili, onion and similar food is forbidden for the pregnant mother because the child\u2019s body is too delicate and new for him to tolerate such pungent food. Restrictions and precautions to be taken by the pregnant mother, as enunciated in the sm\u1e5bti scriptures of Vedic literature, are very useful. We can understand from the Vedic literature how much care is taken to beget a nice child in society. The garbh\u0101dh\u0101na ceremony before sexual intercourse was compulsory for persons in the higher grades of society, and it is very scientific. Other processes recommended in the Vedic literature during pregnancy are also very important. To take care of the child is the primary duty of the parents because if such care is taken, society will be filled with good population to maintain the peace and prosperity of the society, country and human race."

Miserable life begins from the moment the living entity begins to contact his material body. Unfortunately, we forget this experience and do not take the miseries of birth very seriously. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, therefore, it is specifically mentioned that one should be very alert to understand the specific difficulties of birth and death. Just as during the formation of this body we have to pass through so many difficulties within the womb of the mother, at the time of death there are also many difficulties. As described in the previous chapter, one has to transmigrate from one body to another, and the transmigration into the bodies of dogs and hogs is especially miserable. But despite such miserable conditions, due to the spell of m\u0101y\u0101 we forget everything and become enamored by the present so-called happiness, which is described as actually no more than a counteraction to distress."

        "purport": " The word calac-cara\u1e47\u0101ravindam refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who actually walks or travels upon the surface of the world. For example, Lord R\u0101macandra actually walked on the surface of the world, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also walked just like an ordinary man. The prayer is therefore offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who descends to the surface of this earth, or any part of this universe, for the protection of the pious and the destruction of the impious. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that when there is an increase of irreligion and discrepancies arise in the real religious activities, the Supreme Lord comes to protect the pious and kill the impious. This verse indicates Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Another significant point in this verse is that the Lord comes, icchay\u0101, by His own will. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sambhav\u0101my \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101: \u201cI appear at My will, by My internal potency.\u201d He is not forced to come by the laws of material nature. It is stated here, icchay\u0101: He does not assume any form, as the impersonalists think, because He comes at His own will, and the form in which He descends is His eternal form. As the Supreme Lord puts the living entity into the condition of horrible existence, He can also deliver him, and therefore one should seek shelter at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a demands, \u201cGive up everything and surrender unto Me.\u201d And it is also said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that anyone who approaches Him does not come back again to accept a form in material existence, but goes back to Godhead, back home, never to return."

Both the Supreme Soul and the j\u012bva soul are sitting in the same body, as confirmed in the Upani\u1e63ads. They are sitting as friends, but one is suffering, and the other is aloof from suffering. In this verse it is said, vi\u015buddham avik\u0101ram akha\u1e47\u1e0da-bodham: the Supersoul is always sitting apart from all contamination. The living entity is contaminated and suffering because he has a material body, but that does not mean that because the Lord is also with him, He also has a material body. He is avik\u0101ram, changeless. He is always the same Supreme, but unfortunately the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, because of their impure hearts, cannot understand that the Supreme Soul, the Supersoul, is different from the individual soul. It is said here, \u0101tapyam\u0101na-h\u1e5bdaye\u00a0\u2019vasitam: He is in the heart of every living entity, but He can be realized only by a soul who is repentant. The individual soul becomes repentant that he forgot his constitutional position, wanted to become one with the Supreme Soul and tried his best to lord it over material nature. He has been baffled, and therefore he is repentant. At that time, Supersoul, or the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul, is realized. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, after many, many births the knowledge comes to the conditioned soul that V\u0101sudeva is great, He is master, and He is Lord. The individual soul is the servant, and therefore he surrenders unto Him. At that time he becomes a mah\u0101tm\u0101, a great soul. Therefore, a fortunate living being who comes to this understanding, even within the womb of his mother, has his liberation assured."

When the living entity is put into material nature, then his senses and qualities are polluted, or designated. There is no possibility for the Supreme Lord to become embodied by material qualities or material senses, for He is above the influence of material nature and cannot possibly be put in the darkness of ignorance like the living entities. Because of His full knowledge, He is never subjected to the influence of material nature. Material nature is always under His control, and it is therefore not possible that material nature can control the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since the identity of the living entity is very minute, he is prone to be subjected to material nature, but when he is freed from this material body, which is false, he attains the same spiritual nature as the Supreme Lord. At that time there is no qualitative difference between him and the Supreme Lord, but because he is not so quantitatively powerful as to never be put under the influence of material nature, he is quantitatively different from the Lord. The entire process of devotional service is to purify oneself of this contamination of material nature and put oneself on the spiritual platform, where he is qualitatively one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedas it is said that the living entity is always free. Asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25. The living entity is liberated. His material contamination is temporary, and his actual position is that he is liberated. This liberation is achieved by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which begins from the point of surrender. Therefore it is said here, \u201cI offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Person.\u201d"

This conditional life is due to his forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, without the Lord\u2019s mercy, how can he again engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord?",
        "purport": " The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers say that simply by cultivation of knowledge by mental speculation, one can be liberated from the condition of material bondage. But here it is said one is liberated not by knowledge but by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. The knowledge the conditioned soul gains by mental speculation, however powerful it may be, is always too imperfect to approach the Absolute Truth. It is said that without the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead one cannot understand Him or His actual form, quality and name. Those who are not in devotional service go on speculating for many, many thousands of years, but they are still unable to understand the nature of the Absolute Truth. One can be liberated in the knowledge of the Absolute Truth simply by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is clearly said herein that our memory is lost because we are now covered by His material energy. Arguments may be put forward as to why we have been put under the influence of this material energy by the supreme will of the Lord. This is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, where the Lord says, \u201cI am sitting in everyone\u2019s heart, and due to Me one is forgetful or one is alive in knowledge.\u201d The forgetfulness of the conditioned soul is also due to the direction of the Supreme Lord. A living entity misuses his little independence when he wants to lord it over material nature. This misuse of independence, which is called m\u0101y\u0101, is always available, otherwise there would be no independence. Independence implies that one can use it properly or improperly. It is not static; it is dynamic. Therefore, misuse of independence is the cause of being influenced by m\u0101y\u0101. M\u0101y\u0101 is so strong that the Lord says that it is very difficult to surmount her influence. But one can do so very easily \u201cif he surrenders unto Me.\u201d M\u0101m eva ye prapadyante: anyone who surrenders unto Him can overcome the influence of the stringent laws of material nature. It is clearly said here that a living entity is put under the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 by His will, and if anyone wants to get out of this entanglement, this can be made possible simply by His mercy. The activities of the conditioned souls under the influence of material nature are explained here. Every conditioned soul is engaged in different types of work under the influence of material nature. We can see in the material world that the conditioned soul acts so powerfully that he is playing wonderfully in creating the so-called advancements of material civilization for sense gratification. But actually his position is to know that he is an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. When he is actually in perfect knowledge, he knows that the Lord is the supreme worshipful object and that the living entity is His eternal servant. Without this knowledge, he engages in material activities; that is called ignorance."

        "translation": "No one other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, the partial representation of the Lord, is directing all inanimate and animate objects. He is present in the three phases of time \u2014 past, present and future. Therefore, the conditioned soul is engaged in different activities by His direction, and in order to get free from the threefold miseries of this conditional life, we have to surrender unto Him only.",
        "purport": " When a conditioned soul is seriously anxious to get out of the influence of the material clutches, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated within him as Param\u0101tm\u0101, gives him this knowledge: \u201cSurrender unto Me.\u201d As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u201cGive up all other engagements. Just surrender unto Me.\u201d It is to be accepted that the source of knowledge is the Supreme Person. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca. The Lord says, \u201cThrough Me one gets real knowledge and memory, and one also forgets through Me.\u201d To one who wants to be materially satisfied or who wants to lord it over material nature, the Lord gives the opportunity to forget His service and engage in the so-called happiness of material activities. Similarly, when one is frustrated in lording it over material nature and is very serious about getting out of this material entanglement, the Lord, from within, gives him the knowledge that he has to surrender unto Him; then there is liberation. This knowledge cannot be imparted by anyone other than the Supreme Lord or His representative. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta Lord Caitanya instructs R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b that the living entities wander in life after life, undergoing the miserable conditions of material existence. But when one is very anxious to get free from the material entanglement, he gets enlightenment through a spiritual master and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This means that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supersoul is seated within the heart of the living entity, and when the living entity is serious, the Lord directs him to take shelter of His representative, a bona fide spiritual master. Directed from within and guided externally by the spiritual master, one attains the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is the way out of the material clutches. Therefore there is no possibility of one\u2019s being situated in his own position unless he is blessed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unless he is enlightened with the supreme knowledge, one has to undergo the severe penalties of the hard struggle for existence in the material nature. The spiritual master is therefore the mercy manifestation of the Supreme Person. The conditioned soul has to take direct instruction from the spiritual master, and thus he gradually becomes enlightened to the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The seed of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is sown within the heart of the conditioned soul, and when one hears instruction from the spiritual master, the seed fructifies, and one\u2019s life is blessed."

        "purport": " The precarious condition of the living entity within the womb of his mother is described here. On one side of where the child is floating is the heat of gastric fire, and on the other side are urine, stool, blood and discharges. After seven months the child, who has regained his consciousness, feels the horrible condition of his existence and prays to the Lord. Counting the months until his release, he becomes greatly anxious to get out of the confinement. The so-called civilized man does not take account of this horrible condition of life, and sometimes, for the purpose of sense gratification, he tries to kill the child by methods of contraception or abortion. Unserious about the horrible condition in the womb, such persons continue in materialism, grossly misusing the chance of the human form of life. The word k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a-dh\u012b\u1e25 is significant in this verse. Dh\u012b means \u201cintelligence,\u201d and k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a means \u201cmiserly.\u201d Conditional life is for persons who are of miserly intelligence or who do not properly utilize their intelligence. In the human form of life the intelligence is developed, and one has to utilize that developed intelligence to get out of the cycle of birth and death. One who does not do so is a miser, just like a person who has immense wealth but does not utilize it, keeping it simply to see. A person who does not actually utilize his human intelligence to get out of the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, the cycle of birth and death, is accepted as miserly. The exact opposite of miserly is ud\u0101ra, \u201cvery magnanimous.\u201d A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is called ud\u0101ra because he utilizes his human intelligence for spiritual realization. He uses that intelligence to preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for the benefit of the public, and therefore he is magnanimous."

The Lord is always seeking the opportunity to reclaim the fallen souls to His abode, the kingdom of God. We should always feel very much obliged to the Personality of Godhead, for He is always anxious to bring us into the happy condition of eternal life. There is no sufficient means to repay the Personality of Godhead for His act of benediction; therefore, we can simply feel gratitude and pray to the Lord with folded hands. This prayer of the child in the womb may be questioned by some atheistic people. How can a child pray in such a nice way in the womb of his mother? Everything is possible by the grace of the Lord. The child is put into such a precarious condition externally, but internally he is the same, and the Lord is there. By the transcendental energy of the Lord, everything is possible."

The fortunate child in the womb of his mother realizes his superior position and is thereby distinguished from other bodies. Animals in bodies lower than that of the human being are conscious only as far as their bodily distress and happiness are concerned; they cannot think of more than their bodily necessities of life-eating, sleeping, mating and defending. But in the human form of life, by the grace of God, the consciousness is so developed that a man can evaluate his exceptional position and thus realize the self and the Supreme Lord. The word dama-\u015bar\u012br\u012b means that we have a body in which we can control the senses and the mind. The complication of materialistic life is due to an uncontrolled mind and uncontrolled senses. One should feel grateful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for having obtained such a nice human form of body, and one should properly utilize it. The distinction between an animal and a man is that the animal cannot control himself and has no sense of decency, whereas the human being has the sense of decency and can control himself. If this controlling power is not exhibited by the human being, then he is no better than an animal. By controlling the senses, or by the process of yoga regulation, one can understand the position of his self, the Supersoul, the world and their interrelation; everything is possible by controlling the senses. Otherwise, we are no better than animals. Real self-realization by means of controlling the senses is explained herein. One should try to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead and one\u2019s own self also. To think oneself the same as the Supreme is not self-realization. Here it is clearly explained that the Supreme Lord is an\u0101di, or pur\u0101\u1e47a, and He has no other cause. The living entity is born of the Supreme Godhead as part and parcel. It is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25: Govinda, the Supreme Person, has no cause. He is unborn. But the living entity is born of Him. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25: both the living entity and the Supreme Lord are unborn, but it has to be understood that the supreme cause of the part and parcel is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 therefore says that everything has come from the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am). The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra confirms this also. Janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25: the Absolute Truth is the original source of everyone\u2019s birth. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25: \u201cI am the source of birth of everything, including Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva and the living entities.\u201d This is self-realization. One should know that he is under the control of the Supreme Lord and not think that he is fully independent. Otherwise, why should he be put into conditional life?"

        "translation": "Therefore, my Lord, although I am living in a terrible condition, I do not wish to depart from my mother\u2019s abdomen to fall again into the blind well of materialistic life. Your external energy, called deva-m\u0101y\u0101, at once captures the newly born child, and immediately false identification, which is the beginning of the cycle of continual birth and death, begins.",
        "purport": " As long as the child is within the womb of his mother, he is in a very precarious and horrible condition of life, but the benefit is that he revives pure consciousness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord and prays for deliverance. But once he is outside the abdomen, when a child is born, m\u0101y\u0101, or the illusory energy, is so strong that he is immediately overpowered into considering his body to be his self. M\u0101y\u0101 means \u201cillusion,\u201d or that which is actually not. In the material world, everyone is identifying with his body. This false egoistic consciousness of \u201cI am this body\u201d at once develops after the child comes out of the womb. The mother and other relatives are awaiting the child, and as soon as he is born, the mother feeds him and everyone takes care of him. The living entity soon forgets his position and becomes entangled in bodily relationships. The entire material existence is entanglement in this bodily conception of life. Real knowledge means to develop the consciousness of \u201cI am not this body. I am spirit soul, an eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.\u201d Real knowledge entails renunciation, or nonacceptance of this body as the self. By the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, the external energy, one forgets everything just after birth. Therefore the child is praying that he prefers to remain within the womb rather than come out. It is said that \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, on this consideration, remained for sixteen years within the womb of his mother; he did not want to be entangled in false bodily identification. After cultivating such knowledge within the womb of his mother, he came out at the end of sixteen years and immediately left home so that he might not be captured by the influence of m\u0101y\u0101. The influence of m\u0101y\u0101 is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as insurmountable. But insurmountable m\u0101y\u0101 can be overcome simply by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te. Whoever surrenders unto the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can get out of this false conception of life. By the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 only, one forgets his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and identifies himself with his body and the by-products of the body \u2014 namely wife, children, society, friendship and love. Thus he becomes a victim of the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, and his materialistic life of continued birth and death becomes still more stringent."

        "translation": "Therefore, without being agitated any more, I shall deliver myself from the darkness of nescience with the help of my friend, clear consciousness. Simply by keeping the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in my mind, I shall be saved from entering into the wombs of many mothers for repeated birth and death.",
        "purport": " The miseries of material existence begin from the very day when the spirit soul takes shelter in the ovum and sperm of the mother and father, they continue after he is born from the womb, and then they are further prolonged. We do not know where the suffering ends. It does not end, however, by one\u2019s changing his body. The change of body is taking place at every moment, but that does not mean that we are improving from the fetal condition of life to a more comfortable condition. The best thing, therefore, is to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Here it is stated, upas\u0101dita-vi\u1e63\u1e47u-p\u0101da\u1e25. This means realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is intelligent, by the grace of the Lord, and develops K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is successful in his life because simply by keeping himself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he will be saved from the repetition of birth and death. The child prays that it is better to remain within the womb of darkness and be constantly absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness than to get out and again fall a victim to the illusory energy. The illusory energy acts within the abdomen as well as outside the abdomen, but the trick is that one should remain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, and then the effect of such a horrible condition cannot act unfavorably upon him. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that one\u2019s intelligence is his friend, and the same intelligence can also be his enemy. Here also the same idea is repeated: suh\u1e5bd\u0101tmanaiva, friendly intelligence. Absorption of intelligence in the personal service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and full consciousness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always are the path of self-realization and liberation. Without being unnecessarily agitated, if we take to the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by constantly chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, the cycle of birth and death can be stopped for good. It may be questioned herein how the child can be fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious within the womb of the mother without any paraphernalia with which to execute K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is not necessary to arrange for paraphernalia to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The child wants to remain within the abdomen of its mother and at the same time wants to become free from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. One does not need any material arrangement to cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One can cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness anywhere and everywhere, provided he can always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The mah\u0101-mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, can be chanted even within the abdomen of one\u2019s mother. One can chant while sleeping, while working, while imprisoned in the womb or while outside. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be checked in any circumstance. The conclusion of the child\u2019s prayer is: \u201cLet me remain in this condition; although it is very miserable, it is better not to fall a victim to m\u0101y\u0101 again by going outside.\u201d"

Sometimes the trouble is so severe that the child comes out dead or almost dead. One can imagine what the pangs of birth are like. The child remains for ten months in that horrible condition within the abdomen, and at the end of ten months he is forcibly pushed out. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord points out that a person who is serious about advancement in spiritual consciousness should always consider the four pangs of birth, death, disease and old age. The materialist advances in many ways, but he is unable to stop these four principles of suffering inherent in material existence."

It is said that a living entity is eternal and, as such, qualitatively one with the Supreme Lord. Then what is the reason he falls prey to the material and commits so many sinful activities by the influence of the material energy? In reply to this question, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that it is lust which causes a living entity to glide down from his exalted position to the abominable condition of material existence. This lust circumstantially changes into anger. Both lust and anger stand on the platform of the mode of passion. Lust is actually the product of the mode of passion, and in the absence of satisfaction of lust, the same desire transforms into anger on the platform of ignorance. When ignorance covers the soul, it is the source of his degradation to the most abominable condition of hellish life. To raise oneself from hellish life to the highest position of spiritual understanding is to transform this lust into love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012b Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a great \u0101c\u0101rya of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava samprad\u0101ya, said, k\u0101ma k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karm\u0101rpa\u1e47e: due to our lust, we want many things for our sense gratification, but the same lust can be transformed in a purified way so that we want everything for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anger also can be utilized towards a person who is atheistic or who is envious of the Personality of Godhead. As we have fallen into this material existence because of our lust and anger, the same two qualities can be utilized for the purpose of advancing in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and one can elevate himself again to his former pure, spiritual position. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has therefore recommended that because in material existence we have so many objects of sense gratification, which we need for the maintenance of the body, we should use all of them without attachment, for the purpose of satisfying the senses of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that is actual renunciation."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that one has to work to satisfy Yaj\u00f1a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, for any work done without the purpose of satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a cause of bondage. In the conditioned state a living entity, accepting his body as himself, forgets his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and acts on the interest of his body. He takes the body as himself, his bodily expansions as his kinsmen, and the land from which his body is born as worshipable. In this way he performs all sorts of misconceived activities, which lead to his perpetual bondage in repetition of birth and death in various species. In modern civilization, the so-called social, national and government leaders mislead people more and more, under the bodily conception of life, with the result that all the leaders, with their followers, are gliding down to hellish conditions birth after birth. An example is given in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Andh\u0101 yath\u0101ndhair upan\u012byam\u0101n\u0101\u1e25: when a blind man leads several other blind men, the result is that all of them fall down in a ditch. This is actually happening. There are many leaders to lead the ignorant public, but because every one of them is bewildered by the bodily conception of life, there is no peace and prosperity in human society. So-called yog\u012bs who perform various bodily feats are also in the same category as such ignorant people because the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system is especially recommended for persons who are grossly implicated in the bodily conception. The conclusion is that as long as one is fixed in the bodily conception, he has to suffer birth and death."

        "purport": " It has been explained that the conditioned soul is put into the Andha-t\u0101misra and T\u0101misra hellish conditions, and after suffering there he gets a hellish body like the dog\u2019s or hog\u2019s. After several such births, he again comes into the form of a human being. How the human being is born is also described by Kapiladeva. The human being develops in the mother\u2019s abdomen and suffers there and comes out again. After all these sufferings, if he gets another chance in a human body and wastes his valuable time in the association of persons who are concerned with sexual life and palatable dishes, then naturally he again glides down to the same Andha-t\u0101misra and T\u0101misra hells. Generally, people are concerned with the satisfaction of the tongue and the satisfaction of the genitals. That is material life. Material life means eat, drink, be merry and enjoy, with no concern for understanding one\u2019s spiritual identity and the process of spiritual advancement. Since materialistic people are concerned with the tongue, belly and genitals, if anyone wants to advance in spiritual life he must be very careful about associating with such people. To associate with such materialistic men is to commit purposeful suicide in the human form of life. It is said, therefore, that an intelligent man should give up such undesirable association and should always mix with saintly persons. When he is in association with saintly persons, all his doubts about the spiritual expansion of life are eradicated, and he makes tangible progress on the path of spiritual understanding. It is also sometimes found that people are very much addicted to a particular type of religious faith. Hindus, Muslims and Christians are faithful in their particular type of religion, and they go to the church, temple or mosque, but unfortunately they cannot give up the association of persons who are too much addicted to sex life and satisfaction of the palate. Here it is clearly said that one may officially be a very religious man, but if he associates with such persons, then he is sure to slide down to the darkest region of hell."

        "purport": " Attachment to women is so contaminating that one becomes attached to the condition of material life not only by the association of women but by the contaminated association of persons who are too attached to them. There are many reasons for our conditional life in the material world, but the topmost of all such causes is the association of women, as will be confirmed in the following stanzas. In Kali-yuga, association with women is very strong. In every step of life, there is association with women. If a person goes to purchase something, the advertisements are full of pictures of women. The physiological attraction for women is very great, and therefore people are very slack in spiritual understanding. The Vedic civilization, being based on spiritual understanding, arranges association with women very cautiously. Out of the four social divisions, the members of the first order (namely brahmacarya), the third order (v\u0101naprastha) and the fourth order (sanny\u0101sa) are strictly prohibited from female association. Only in one order, the householder, is there license to mix with women under restricted conditions. In other words, attraction for woman\u2019s association is the cause of the material conditional life, and anyone interested in being freed from this conditional life must detach himself from the association of women."

        "purport": " There are many instances in the history of the world of a great conqueror\u2019s being captivated by the charms of a Cleopatra. One has to study the captivating potency of woman, and man\u2019s attraction for that potency. From what source was this generated? According to Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, we can understand that everything is generated from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is enunciated there, janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25. This means that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the Supreme Person, Brahman, the Absolute Truth, is the source from whom everything emanates. The captivating power of woman, and man\u2019s susceptibility to such attraction, must also exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the spiritual world and must be represented in the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. The Lord is the Supreme Person, the supreme male. As a common male wants to be attracted by a female, that propensity similarly exists in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He also wants to be attracted by the beautiful features of a woman. Now the question is, if He wants to be captivated by such womanly attraction, would He be attracted by any material woman? It is not possible. Even persons who are in this material existence can give up womanly attraction if they are attracted by the Supreme Brahman. Such was the case with Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura. A beautiful prostitute tried to attract him in the dead of night, but since he was situated in devotional service, in transcendental love of Godhead, Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura was not captivated. Rather, he turned the prostitute into a great devotee by his transcendental association. Therefore this material attraction certainly cannot attract the Supreme Lord. When He wants to be attracted by a woman, He has to create such a woman from His own energy. That woman is R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. It is explained by the Gosv\u0101m\u012bs that R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b is the manifestation of the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the Supreme Lord wants to derive transcendental pleasure, He has to create a woman from His internal potency. Thus the tendency to be attracted by womanly beauty is natural because it exists in the spiritual world. In the material world it is reflected pervertedly, and therefore there are so many inebrieties. Instead of being attracted by material beauty, if one is accustomed to being attracted by the beauty of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then the statement of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate, holds true. When one is attracted by the transcendental beauty of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is no longer attracted by material feminine beauty. That is the special significance of R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a worship. That is testified to by Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya. He says, \u201cSince I have become attracted by the beauty of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, when there is attraction for a woman or a memory of sex life with a woman, I at once spit on it, and my face turns in disgust.\u201d When we are attracted by Madana-mohana and the beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His consorts, then the shackles of conditioned life, namely the beauty of a material woman, cannot attract us."

        "purport": " The culmination of yoga is full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is affirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: a person who is always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotion is the topmost of all yog\u012bs. And in the Second Chapter of the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, it is also stated that when one becomes freed from material contamination by rendering devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can at that time understand the science of God. Here the word pratilabdh\u0101tma-l\u0101bha\u1e25 occurs. \u0100tm\u0101 means \u201cself,\u201d and l\u0101bha means \u201cgain.\u201d Generally, conditioned souls have lost their \u0101tm\u0101, or self, but those who are transcendentalists have realized the self. It is directed that such a self-realized soul who aspires to the topmost platform of yogic perfection should not associate with young women. In the modern age, however, there are so many rascals who recommend that while one has genitals he should enjoy women as much as he likes, and at the same time he can become a yog\u012b. In no standard yoga system is the association of women accepted. It is clearly stated here that the association of women is the gateway to hellish life. The association of woman is very much restricted in the Vedic civilization. Out of the four social divisions, the brahmac\u0101r\u012b, v\u0101naprastha and the sanny\u0101s\u012b \u2014 three orders \u2014 are strictly prohibited from the association of women; only the g\u1e5bhasthas, or householders, are given license to have an intimate relationship with a woman, and that relationship is also restricted for begetting nice children. If, however, one wants to stick to continued existence in the material world, he may indulge in female association unrestrictedly."

        "purport": " Sometimes it happens that a rejected well is covered by grass, and an unwary traveler who does not know of the existence of the well falls down, and his death is assured. Similarly, association with a woman begins when one accepts service from her, because woman is especially created by the Lord to give service to man. By accepting her service, a man is entrapped. If he is not intelligent enough to know that she is the gateway to hellish life, he may indulge in her association very liberally. This is restricted for those who aspire to ascend to the transcendental platform. Even fifty years ago in Hindu society, such association was restricted. A wife could not see her husband during the daytime. Householders even had different residential quarters. The internal quarters of a residential house were for the woman, and the external quarters were for the man. Acceptance of service rendered by a woman may appear very pleasing, but one should be very cautious in accepting such service because it is clearly said that woman is the gateway to death, or forgetfulness of one\u2019s self. She blocks the path of spiritual realization."

        "purport": " From this verse it appears that a woman is also supposed to have been a man in his (her) previous life, and due to his attachment to his wife, he now has the body of a woman. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms this: a man gets his next life\u2019s birth according to what he thinks of at the time of death. If someone is too attached to his wife, naturally he thinks of his wife at the time of death, and in his next life he takes the body of a woman. Similarly, if a woman thinks of her husband at the time of death, naturally she gets the body of a man in the next life. In the Hindu scriptures, therefore, woman\u2019s chastity and devotion to man is greatly emphasized. A woman\u2019s attachment to her husband may elevate her to the body of a man in her next life, but a man\u2019s attachment to a woman will degrade him, and in his next life he will get the body of a woman. We should always remember, as it is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, that both the gross and subtle material bodies are dresses; they are the shirt and coat of the living entity. To be either a woman or a man only involves one\u2019s bodily dress. The soul in nature is actually the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. Every living entity, being classified as energy, is supposed to be originally a woman, or one who is enjoyed. In the body of a man there is a greater opportunity to get out of the material clutches; there is less opportunity in the body of a woman. In this verse it is indicated that the body of a man should not be misused through forming an attachment to women and thus becoming too entangled in material enjoyment, which will result in getting the body of a woman in the next life. A woman is generally fond of household prosperity, ornaments, furniture and dresses. She is satisfied when the husband supplies all these things sufficiently. The relationship between man and woman is very complicated, but the substance is that one who aspires to ascend to the transcendental stage of spiritual realization should be very careful in accepting the association of a woman. In the stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, such restriction of association may be slackened because if a man\u2019s and woman\u2019s attachment is not to each other but to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then both of them are equally eligible to get out of the material entanglement and reach the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, anyone who seriously takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2014 whether in the lowest species of life or a woman or of the less intelligent classes, such as the mercantile or laborer class \u2014 will go back home, back to Godhead, and reach the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A man should not be attached to a woman, nor should a woman be attached to a man. Both man and woman should be attached to the service of the Lord. Then there is the possibility of liberation from material entanglement for both of them."

        "purport": " In these instructions of Lord Kapiladeva it is explained that not only is woman the gateway to hell for man, but man is also the gateway to hell for woman. It is a question of attachment. A man becomes attached to a woman because of her service, her beauty and many other assets, and similarly a woman becomes attached to a man for his giving her a nice place to live, ornaments, dress and children. It is a question of attachment for one another. As long as either is attached to the other for such material enjoyment, the woman is dangerous for the man, and the man is also dangerous for the woman. But if the attachment is transferred to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, both of them become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, and then marriage is very nice. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b therefore recommends: Man and woman should live together as householders in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, only for the purpose of discharging duties in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Since the medium is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the consciousness is pure and there is no possibility of degradation at any time."

This process is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Bhr\u0101mayan sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni yantr\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101ni m\u0101yay\u0101: under the spell of m\u0101y\u0101, everyone is wandering throughout the universe on the carriage of the body offered by the material energy. Materialistic life involves a series of actions and reactions. It is a long film spool of actions and reactions, and one life span is just a flash in such a reactionary show. When a child is born, it is to be understood that his particular type of body is the beginning of another set of activities, and when an old man dies, it is to be understood that one set of reactionary activities is finished. We can see that because of different reactionary activities, one man is born in a rich family, and another is born in a poor family, although both of them are born in the same place, at the same moment and in the same atmosphere. One who is carrying pious activity with him is given a chance to take his birth in a rich or pious family, and one who is carrying impious activity is given a chance to take birth in a lower, poor family. The change of body means a change to a different field of activities. Similarly, when the body of the boy changes into that of a youth, the boyish activities change into youthful activities. It is clear that a particular body is given to the living entity for a particular type of activity. This process is going on perpetually, from a time which is impossible to trace out. Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava poets therefore say, an\u0101di karama-phale, which means that these actions and reactions of one\u2019s activity cannot be traced, for they may even continue from the last millennium of Brahm\u0101\u2019s birth to the next millennium. We have seen the example in the life of N\u0101rada Muni. In one millennium he was the son of a maidservant, and in the next millennium he became a great sage."

        "translation": "When the eyes lose their power to see color or form due to morbid affliction of the optic nerve, the sense of sight becomes deadened. The living entity, who is the seer of both the eyes and the sight, loses his power of vision. In the same way, when the physical body, the place where perception of objects occurs, is rendered incapable of perceiving, that is known as death. When one begins to view the physical body as one\u2019s very self, that is called birth.",
        "purport": " When one says, \u201cI see,\u201d this means that he sees with his eyes or with his spectacles; he sees with the instrument of sight. If the instrument of sight is broken or becomes diseased or incapable of acting, then he, as the seer, also ceases to act. Similarly, in this material body, at the present moment the living soul is acting, and when the material body, due to its incapability to function, ceases, he also ceases to perform his reactionary activities. When one\u2019s instrument of action is broken and cannot function, that is called death. Again, when one gets a new instrument for action, that is called birth. This process of birth and death is going on at every moment, by constant bodily change. The final change is called death, and acceptance of a new body is called birth. That is the solution to the question of birth and death. Actually, the living entity has neither birth nor death, but is eternal. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre: the living entity never dies, even after the death or annihilation of this material body."

        "translation": "Therefore, one should not view death with horror, nor have recourse to defining the body as soul, nor give way to exaggeration in enjoying the bodily necessities of life. Realizing the true nature of the living entity, one should move about in the world free from attachment and steadfast in purpose.",
        "purport": " A sane person who has understood the philosophy of life and death is very upset upon hearing of the horrible, hellish condition of life in the womb of the mother or outside of the mother. But one has to make a solution to the problems of life. A sane man should understand the miserable condition of this material body. Without being unnecessarily upset, he should try to find out if there is a remedy. The remedial measures can be understood when one associates with persons who are liberated. It must be understood who is actually liberated. The liberated person is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: one who engages in uninterrupted devotional service to the Lord, having surpassed the stringent laws of material nature, is understood to be situated in Brahman. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is beyond the material creation. It is admitted even by impersonalists like \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is transcendental to this material creation. As such, when one actually engages in the service of the Lord in various forms, either N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a or R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or S\u012bt\u0101-R\u0101ma, he is understood to be on the platform of liberation. The Bh\u0101gavatam also confirms that liberation means to be situated in one\u2019s constitutional position. Since a living entity is eternally the servitor of the Supreme Lord, when one seriously and sincerely engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he is situated in the position of liberation. One should try to associate with a liberated person, and then the problems of life, namely birth and death, can be solved. While discharging devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one should not be miserly. He should not unnecessarily show that he has renounced this world. Actually, renunciation is not possible. If one renounces his palatial building and goes to a forest, there is actually no renunciation, for the palatial building is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the forest is also the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he changes from one property to another, that does not mean that he renounces; he was never the proprietor of either the palace or the forest. Renunciation necessitates renouncing the false understanding that one can lord it over material nature. When one renounces this false attitude and renounces the puffed-up position that he is also God, that is real renunciation. Otherwise, there is no meaning of renunciation. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b advises that if one renounces anything which could be applied in the service of the Lord and does not use it for that purpose, that is called phalgu-vair\u0101gya, insufficient or false renunciation. Everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore everything can be engaged in the service of the Lord; nothing should be used for one\u2019s sense gratification. That is real renunciation. Nor should one unnecessarily increase the necessities of the body. We should be satisfied with whatever is offered and supplied by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without much personal endeavor. We should spend our time executing devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is the solution to the problem of life and death."

To answer this argument, it is described here that one has to associate with liberated persons not directly, physically, but by understanding, through philosophy and logic, the problems of life. It is stated here, samyag-dar\u015banay\u0101 buddhy\u0101: one has to see perfectly, and by intelligence and yogic practice one has to renounce this world. That renunciation can be achieved by the process recommended in the Second Chapter of the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The devotee\u2019s intelligence is always in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His attitude towards the material existence is one of detachment, for he knows perfectly well that this material world is a creation of illusory energy. Realizing himself to be part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, the devotee discharges his devotional service and is completely aloof from material action and reaction. Thus at the end he gives up his material body, or the material energy, and as pure soul he enters the kingdom of God."
