        "translation": "Maitreya continued: After the departure of her parents, the chaste woman Devah\u016bti, who could understand the desires of her husband, served him constantly with great love, as Bhav\u0101n\u012b, the wife of Lord \u015aiva, serves her husband.",
        "purport": " The specific example of Bhav\u0101n\u012b is very significant. Bhav\u0101n\u012b means the wife of Bhava, or Lord \u015aiva. Bhav\u0101n\u012b, or P\u0101rvat\u012b, the daughter of the King of the Him\u0101layas, selected Lord \u015aiva, who appears to be just like a beggar, as her husband. In spite of her being a princess, she undertook all kinds of tribulations to associate with Lord \u015aiva, who did not even have a house, but was sitting underneath the trees and passing his time in meditation. Although Bhav\u0101n\u012b was the daughter of a very great king, she used to serve Lord \u015aiva just like a poor woman. Similarly, Devah\u016bti was the daughter of an emperor, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, yet she preferred to accept Kardama Muni as her husband. She served him with great love and affection, and she knew how to please him. Therefore she is designated here as s\u0101dhv\u012b, which means \u201ca chaste, faithful wife.\u201d Her rare example is the ideal of Vedic civilization. Every woman is expected to be as good and chaste as Devah\u016bti or Bhav\u0101n\u012b. Today in Hindu society, unmarried girls are still taught to worship Lord \u015aiva with the idea that they may get husbands like him. Lord \u015aiva is the ideal husband, not in the sense of riches or sense gratification, but because he is the greatest of all devotees. Vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 yath\u0101 \u015bambhu\u1e25: \u015aambhu, or Lord \u015aiva, is the ideal Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. He constantly meditates upon Lord R\u0101ma and chants Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Lord \u015aiva has a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava samprad\u0101ya, which is called the Vi\u1e63\u1e47usv\u0101m\u012b samprad\u0101ya. Unmarried girls worship Lord \u015aiva so that they can expect a husband who is as good a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava as he. The girls are not taught to select a husband who is very rich or very opulent for material sense gratification; rather, if a girl is fortunate enough to get a husband as good as Lord \u015aiva in devotional service, then her life becomes perfect. The wife is dependent on the husband, and if the husband is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, then naturally she shares the devotional service of the husband because she renders him service. This reciprocation of service and love between husband and wife is the ideal of a householder\u2019s life."

        "purport": " Here two words are very significant. Devah\u016bti served her husband in two ways, vi\u015brambhe\u1e47a and gaurave\u1e47a. These are two important processes in serving the husband or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vi\u015brambhe\u1e47a means \u201cwith intimacy,\u201d and gaurave\u1e47a means \u201cwith great reverence.\u201d The husband is a very intimate friend; therefore the wife must render service just like an intimate friend, and at the same time she must understand that the husband is superior in position, and thus she must offer him all respect. A man\u2019s psychology and woman\u2019s psychology are different. As constituted by bodily frame, a man always wants to be superior to his wife, and a woman, as bodily constituted, is naturally inferior to her husband. Thus the natural instinct is that the husband wants to post himself as superior to the wife, and this must be observed. Even if there is some wrong on the part of the husband, the wife must tolerate it, and thus there will be no misunderstanding between husband and wife. Vi\u015brambhe\u1e47a means \u201cwith intimacy,\u201d but it must not be familiarity that breeds contempt. According to the Vedic civilization, a wife cannot call her husband by name. In the present civilization the wife calls her husband by name, but in Hindu civilization she does not. Thus the inferiority and superiority complexes are recognized. Damena ca: a wife has to learn to control herself even if there is a misunderstanding. Sauh\u1e5bdena v\u0101c\u0101 madhuray\u0101 means always desiring good for the husband and speaking to him with sweet words. A person becomes agitated by so many material contacts in the outside world; therefore in his home life he must be treated by his wife with sweet words."

        "purport": " Here are some of the qualities of a great husband\u2019s great wife. Kardama Muni is great by spiritual qualification. Such a husband is called tej\u012by\u0101\u1e41sam, most powerful. Although a wife may be equal to her husband in advancement in spiritual consciousness, she should not be vainly proud. Sometimes it happens that the wife comes from a very rich family, as did Devah\u016bti, the daughter of Emperor Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu. She could have been very proud of her parentage, but that is forbidden. The wife should not be proud of her parental position. She must always be submissive to the husband and must give up all vanity. As soon as the wife becomes proud of her parentage, her pride creates great misunderstanding between the husband and wife, and their nuptial life is ruined. Devah\u016bti was very careful about that, and therefore it is said here that she gave up pride completely. Devah\u016bti was not unfaithful. The most sinful activity for a wife is to accept another husband or another lover. C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita has described four kinds of enemies at home. If the father is in debt he is considered to be an enemy; if the mother has selected another husband in the presence of her grown-up children, she is considered to be an enemy; if a wife does not live well with her husband but deals very roughly, then she is an enemy; and if a son is a fool, he is also an enemy. In family life, father, mother, wife and children are assets, but if the wife or mother accepts another husband in the presence of her husband or son, then, according to Vedic civilization, she is considered an enemy. A chaste and faithful woman must not practice adultery \u2014 that is a greatly sinful act."

Having served him for a long time, she grew weak and emaciated due to her religious observances.

If the husband is a devotee and the wife is materialistic, there cannot be any peace in the home. The wife must see the tendencies of the husband and must be prepared to follow him. From Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata we learn that when G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b understood that her would-be husband, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, was blind, she immediately began to practice blindness herself. Thus she covered her eyes and played the part of a blind woman. She decided that since her husband was blind, she must also act like a blind woman, otherwise she would be proud of her eyes, and her husband would be seen as inferior. The word samanuvrata indicates that it is the duty of a wife to adopt the special circumstances in which the husband is situated. Of course, if the husband is as great as Kardama Muni, then a very good result accrues from following him. But even if the husband is not a great devotee like Kardama Muni, it is the wife\u2019s duty to adapt herself according to his mentality. That makes married life very happy. It is also mentioned herein that by following the strict vows of a chaste woman, Princess Devah\u016bti became very skinny, and therefore her husband became compassionate. He knew that she was the daughter of a great king and yet was serving him just like an ordinary woman. She was reduced in health by such activities, and he became compassionate and addressed her as follows."

        "purport": " It is indicated here that one\u2019s body is very dear, yet Devah\u016bti was so faithful to her husband that not only did she serve him with great devotion, service and respect, but she did not even care for her own health. That is called selfless service. It appears that Devah\u016bti had no sense pleasure, even with her husband, otherwise she would not have deteriorated in health. Acting to facilitate Kardama Muni\u2019s engagement in spiritual elevation, she continually assisted him, not caring for bodily comfort. It is the duty of a faithful and chaste wife to help her husband in every respect, especially when the husband is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In this case, the husband also amply rewarded the wife. This is not to be expected by a woman who is the wife of an ordinary person."

Although you have not yet experienced these achievements, which are free from fear and lamentation, I shall offer them all to you because you are engaged in my service. Now just look at them. I am giving you the transcendental vision to see how nice they are.",
        "purport": " Devah\u016bti engaged only in the service of Kardama Muni. She was not supposed to be so advanced in austerity, ecstasy, meditation or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but, imperceptibly, she was sharing her husband\u2019s achievements, which she could neither see nor experience. Automatically she achieved these graces of the Lord. What are the graces of the Lord? It is stated here that the graces of the Lord are abhaya, free from fearfulness. In the material world, if someone accumulates a million dollars, he is always full of fear because he is always thinking, \u201cWhat if the money is lost?\u201d But the benediction of the Lord, bhagavat-pras\u0101da, is never to be lost. It is simply to be enjoyed. There is no question of loss. One simply gains and enjoys gaining. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms this: when one achieves the grace of the Lord, the result is that sarva-du\u1e25kh\u0101ni, all distresses, are destroyed. When situated in the transcendental position, one is freed from the two kinds of material diseases \u2014 hankering and lamentation. This is also stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. After devotional life begins, we can achieve the full result of love of Godhead. Love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the highest perfection of bhagavat-pras\u0101da, or divine mercy. This transcendental achievement is so greatly valuable that no material happiness can compare to it. Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b said that if one achieves the grace of Lord Caitanya he becomes so great that he does not care a fig even for the demigods, he thinks of monism as hellish, and for him the perfection of controlling the senses is as easy as anything. Heavenly pleasures become to him no more than stories. Actually, there is no comparison between material happiness and transcendental happiness. By the grace of Kardama Muni, Devah\u016bti experienced actual realization simply by serving. We get a similar example in the life of N\u0101rada Muni. In his previous life, N\u0101rada was a maidservant\u2019s son, but his mother was engaged in the service of great devotees. He got the opportunity to serve the devotees, and simply by eating the remnants of their foodstuff and carrying out their orders he became so elevated that in his next life he became the great personality N\u0101rada. For spiritual achievement the easiest path is to take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and to serve him with heart and soul. That is the secret of success. As stated by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura in his eight stanzas of prayer to the spiritual master, yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101da\u1e25: by serving or receiving the grace of the spiritual master, one receives the grace of the Supreme Lord. By serving her devotee husband, Kardama Muni, Devah\u016bti shared in his achievements. Similarly, a sincere disciple, simply by serving a bona fide spiritual master, can achieve all the mercy of the Lord and the spiritual master simultaneously."

All material achievements are subject to be annihilated simply by a movement of the eyebrows of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By your principles of devotion to your husband, you have achieved and can enjoy transcendental gifts very rarely obtained by persons proud of aristocracy and material possessions.",
        "purport": " Lord Caitanya recommended that the greatest achievement of human life is to achieve the grace of the Lord, love of God. He said, prem\u0101 pumartho mah\u0101n: to achieve love of Godhead is the highest perfection of life. The same perfection is recommended by Kardama Muni to his wife. His wife belonged to a very aristocratic royal family. Generally, those who are very materialistic or who possess material wealth and prosperity are unable to appreciate the value of transcendental love of God. Although Devah\u016bti was a princess coming from a very great royal family, fortunately she was under the supervision of her great husband, Kardama Muni, who offered her the best gift which can be bestowed in human life: the grace of the Lord, or love of God. This grace of the Lord was achieved by Devah\u016bti by the good will and satisfaction of her husband. She served her husband, who was a great devotee and saintly person, with great sincerity, love, affection and service, and Kardama Muni was satisfied. He willingly gave love of God, and he recommended that she accept it and enjoy it because he had already achieved it. Love of God is not an ordinary commodity. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was worshiped by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b because He distributed love of God, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-prem\u0101, to everyone. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b praised Him as mah\u0101-vad\u0101nya, a greatly munificent personality, because He was freely distributing to everyone love of Godhead, which is achieved by wise men only after many, many births. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-prem\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the highest gift which can be bestowed on anyone whom we presume to love. One word used in this verse, nija-dharma-doh\u0101n, is very significant. Devah\u016bti, as the wife of Kardama Muni, achieved an invaluable gift from her husband because she was very faithful to him. For a woman the first principle of religion is to be faithful to her husband. If, fortunately, the husband is a great personality, then the combination is perfect, and the lives of both the wife and the husband are at once fulfilled."

But you once made a promise that our bodily union should now fulfill, since children are a great quality for a chaste woman who has a glorious husband.",
        "purport": " Devah\u016bti expressed her happiness by uttering the word bata, for she knew that her husband was in a highly elevated transcendental position and was under the shelter of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, those who are great souls, mah\u0101tm\u0101s, are not under the control of the material energy. The Supreme Lord has two energies, material and spiritual. The living entities are marginal energy. As marginal energy, a person may be under the control of the material energy or the spiritual energy (yoga-m\u0101y\u0101). Kardama Muni was a great soul, and therefore he was under the spiritual energy, which means that he was directly connected with the Supreme Lord. The symptom of this is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, constant engagement in devotional service. This was known to Devah\u016bti, yet she was anxious to have a son by bodily union with the sage. She reminded her husband of his promise to her parents: \u201cI will remain only until the time of Devah\u016bti\u2019s pregnancy.\u201d She reminded him that for a chaste woman to have a child by a great personality is most glorious. She wanted to be pregnant, and she prayed for that. The word str\u012b means \u201cexpansion.\u201d By bodily union of the husband and wife their qualities are expanded: children born of good parents are expansions of the parents\u2019 personal qualifications. Both Kardama Muni and Devah\u016bti were spiritually enlightened. Therefore she desired from the beginning that first she be pregnant and then she be empowered with the achievement of God\u2019s grace and love of God. For a woman it is a great ambition to have a son of the same quality as a highly qualified husband. Since she had the opportunity to have Kardama Muni as her husband, she also desired to have a child by bodily union."

Therefore kindly make what arrangements must be made according to the scriptures so that my skinny body, emaciated through unsatisfied passion, may be rendered fit for you. Also, my lord, please think of a suitable house for this purpose.",
        "purport": " The Vedic literatures are not only full of spiritual instruction but are also instructive in how to prosecute material existence very nicely, with the ultimate aim of spiritual perfection. Therefore Devah\u016bti asked her husband how to prepare herself for sex life according to the Vedic instructions. Sex life is especially meant for having good children. The circumstances for creating good children are mentioned in k\u0101ma-\u015b\u0101stra, the scripture in which suitable arrangements are prescribed for factually glorious sex life. Everything needed is mentioned in the scriptures \u2014 what sort of house and decorations there should be, what sort of dress the wife should have, how she should be decorated with ointments, scents and other attractive features, etc. With these requisites fulfilled, the husband will be attracted by her beauty, and a favorable mental situation will be created. The mental situation at the time of sex life may then be transferred into the womb of the wife, and good children can come out of that pregnancy. Here is a special reference to Devah\u016bti\u2019s bodily features. Because she had become skinny, she feared that her body might have no attraction for Kardama. She wanted to be instructed how to improve her bodily condition in order to attract her husband. Sexual intercourse in which the husband is attracted to the wife is sure to produce a male child, but sexual intercourse based on attraction of the wife for the husband may produce a girl. That is mentioned in the \u0100yur-veda. When the passion of the woman is greater, there is a chance of a girl\u2019s being born. When the passion of the man is greater, then there is the possibility of a son. Devah\u016bti wanted the passion of her husband to be increased by the arrangement mentioned in the k\u0101ma-\u015b\u0101stra. She wanted him to instruct her in that way, and she also requested that he arrange for a suitable house because the hermitage in which Kardama Muni was living was very simple and completely in the mode of goodness, and there was less possibility of passion\u2019s being aroused in his heart."

That is the way of a God-gifted person. A devotee like Kardama Muni exhibited such opulence by his yogic power at the request of his wife, but when the opulence was produced, he himself could not understand how such manifestations could be possible. When a yog\u012b\u2019s power is exhibited, the yog\u012b himself is sometimes astonished."

She had regained her own original beauty as the daughter of a prince. Dressed in excellent robes, her charming breasts duly girded, she was waited upon by a thousand Gandharva girls. O destroyer of the enemy, his fondness for her grew, and he placed her on the aerial mansion.",
        "purport": " Before her marriage, when Devah\u016bti was brought by her parents before the sage Kardama, she was the perfectly beautiful princess, and Kardama Muni remembered her former beauty. But after her marriage, when she was engaged in the service of Kardama Muni, she neglected to care for her body like a princess, since there was no means for such care; her husband was living in a cottage, and since she was always engaged in serving him, her royal beauty disappeared, and she became just like an ordinary maidservant. Now, after being bathed by the Gandharva girls by the order of Kardama Muni\u2019s yogic power, she regained her beauty, and Kardama Muni felt attracted to the beauty she had shown before the marriage. The real beauty of a young woman is her breasts. When Kardama Muni saw the breasts of his wife so nicely decorated, increasing her beauty many times, he was attracted, even though he was a great sage. \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya has therefore warned the transcendentalists that one who is after transcendental realization should not be attracted by the raised breasts of a woman because they are nothing but an interaction of fat and blood within the body."

It is said that Indra is in charge of the eastern side of the universe, where the heavenly planet, or paradise, is situated. Similarly, Agni is in charge of the southeastern portion of the universe; Yama, the demigod who punishes sinners, is in charge of the southern portion; Nir\u1e5bti is in charge of the southwestern part of the universe; Varu\u1e47a, the demigod in charge of the waters, is in charge of the western portion; V\u0101yu, who controls the air and who has wings to travel in the air, is in charge of the northwestern part of the universe; and Kuvera, the treasurer of the demigods, is in charge of the northern part of the universe. All these demigods take pleasure in the valleys of Mount Meru, which is situated somewhere between the sun and the earth. In the aerial mansion, Kardama Muni traveled throughout the eight directions controlled by the different demigods described above, and as the demigods go to Mount Meru, he also went there to enjoy life. When one is surrounded by beautiful young girls, sex stimulation naturally becomes prominent. Kardama Muni was sexually stimulated, and he enjoyed his wife for many, many years in that part of Mount Meru. But his sex indulgence was praised by many, many Siddhas, beings who have attained perfection, because it was intended to produce good progeny for the good of universal affairs."

        "purport": " The words yair \u0101\u015britas t\u012brtha-pada\u015b cara\u1e47a\u1e25 are significant here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as t\u012brtha-p\u0101da. The Ganges is called a sacred river because it emanates from the toe of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Ganges is meant to eradicate all the material distresses of the conditioned souls. Therefore nothing is impossible for any living entity who has taken shelter of the holy lotus feet of the Lord. Kardama Muni is special not because he was a great mystic, but because he was a great devotee. Therefore it is said here that for a great devotee like Kardama Muni, nothing is impossible. Although yog\u012bs can perform wonderful feats, as Kardama has already displayed, Kardama was more than a yog\u012b because he was a great devotee of the Lord; therefore he was more glorious than an ordinary yog\u012b. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u201cOut of the many yog\u012bs, he who is a devotee of the Lord is first class.\u201d For a person like Kardama Muni there is no question of being conditioned; he was already a liberated soul and better than the demigods, who are also conditioned. Although he was enjoying with his wife and many other women, he was above material, conditional life. Therefore the word vyasan\u0101tyaya\u1e25 is used to indicate that he was beyond the position of a conditioned soul. He was transcendental to all material limitations."

        "purport": " All the planets are here described as gola, round. Every planet is round, and each planet is a different shelter, just like islands in the great ocean. Planets are sometimes called dv\u012bpa or var\u1e63a. This earth planet is called Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a because it was ruled by King Bharata. Another significant word used in this verse is bahv-\u0101\u015bcaryam, \u201cmany wonderful things.\u201d This indicates that the different planets are distributed all over the universe in the eight directions, and each and every one of them is wonderful in itself. Each planet has its particular climatic influences and particular types of inhabitants and is completely equipped with everything, including the beauty of the seasons. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.40) it is similarly stated, vibh\u016bti-bhinnam: on each and every planet there are different opulences. It cannot be expected that one planet is exactly like another. By God\u2019s grace, by nature\u2019s law, each and every planet is made differently and has different wonderful features. All such wonders were personally experienced by Kardama Muni while he traveled with his wife, yet he could return again to his humble hermitage. He showed his princess-wife that although he was living in the hermitage, he had the power to go everywhere and do anything by mystic yoga. That is the perfection of yoga. One cannot become a perfect yog\u012b simply by showing some sitting postures, nor by such sitting postures or so-called meditation can one become God, as is being advertised. Foolish persons are misled into believing that simply by some caricature of meditation and sitting postures one can become God within six months. Here is the example of a perfect yog\u012b; he could travel all over the universe. Similarly, there is a description of Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, who also traveled in space. Actually, the perfect yog\u012b can do that. But even if one can travel all over the universe and show wonderful feats like Kardama Muni, he cannot be compared to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose power and inconceivable energy can never be attained by any conditioned or liberated soul. By the actions of Kardama Muni we can understand that in spite of his immense mystic power, he remained a devotee of the Lord. That is the real position of every living entity."

Instead of one, he became nine, and nine persons had sexual intercourse with Devah\u016bti for many, many years. It is understood that the sexual appetite of a woman is nine times greater than that of a man. That is clearly indicated here. Otherwise, Kardama Muni would have had no reason to expand himself into nine. Here is another example of yogic power. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead can expand Himself in millions of forms, a yog\u012b can also expand up to nine forms, but not more than that. Another example is that of Saubhari Muni; he also expanded himself into eight forms. But however powerful a yog\u012b may be, he cannot expand himself into more than eight or nine forms. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, can expand Himself into millions of forms, ananta-r\u016bpa \u2014 innumerable, countless forms \u2014 as stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101.

To take charge of someone, therefore, either as father, mother, spiritual master, relative or husband, one must accept the responsibility to give his ward freedom from the fearful situation of material existence. Material existence is always fearful and full of anxiety.

        "purport": " It is said that the father himself becomes the son in another form. The father and son are therefore considered to be nondifferent. A widow who has her son is actually not a widow, because she has the representative of her husband. Similarly, Devah\u016bti is indirectly asking Kardama Muni to leave a representative so that in his absence she might be relieved of her anxieties by a suitable son. A householder is not expected to remain at home for all his days. After getting his sons and daughters married, a householder can retire from household life, leaving his wife in the charge of the grown-up sons. That is the social convention of the Vedic system. Devah\u016bti is indirectly asking that in his absence from home there be at least one male child to give her relief from her anxieties. This relief means spiritual instruction. Relief does not mean material comforts. Material comforts will end with the end of the body, but spiritual instruction will not end; it will go on with the spirit soul. Instruction in spiritual advancement is necessary, but without having a worthy son, how could Devah\u016bti advance in spiritual knowledge? It is the duty of the husband to liquidate his debt to his wife. The wife gives her sincere service to the husband, and he becomes indebted to her because one cannot accept service from his subordinate without giving him something in exchange. The spiritual master cannot accept service from a disciple without awarding him spiritual instruction. That is the reciprocation of love and duty. Thus Devah\u016bti reminds her husband, Kardama Muni, that she has rendered him faithful service. Even considering the situation on the basis of liquidating his debt toward his wife, he must give a male child before he leaves. Indirectly, Devah\u016bti requests her husband to remain at home a few days more, or at least until a male child is born."

Kardama Muni could understand Devah\u016bti\u2019s heart. Generally all women desire material enjoyment; they are called less intelligent because they are mostly prone to material enjoyment. Devah\u016bti laments because her husband had given her the best kind of material enjoyment, but she did not know that he was so advanced in spiritual realization. Her plea was that even though she did not know the glories of her great husband, because she had taken shelter of him she must be delivered from material entanglement. Association with a great personality is most important. In Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta Lord Caitanya says that s\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45ga, the association of a great saintly person, is very important, because even if one is not advanced in knowledge, simply by association with a great saintly person one can immediately make considerable advancement in spiritual life. As a woman, as an ordinary wife, Devah\u016bti became attached to Kardama Muni in order to satisfy her sense enjoyment and other material necessities, but actually she associated with a great personality. Now she understood this, and she wanted to utilize the advantage of the association of her great husband."

For example, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a met many kinds of living entities, and some treated Him as an enemy, and some treated Him as an agent for sense gratification. It is generally said that the gop\u012bs were attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for sense attractions, and yet they became first-class devotees of the Lord. Ka\u1e41sa, \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la, Dantavakra and other demons, however, were related to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as enemies. But whether they associated with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as enemies or for sense gratification, out of fear or as pure devotees, they all got liberation. That is the result of association with the Lord. Even if one does not understand who He is, the results have the same efficacy. Association with a great saintly person also results in liberation, just as whether one goes toward fire knowingly or unknowingly, the fire will make one warm. Devah\u016bti expressed her gratefulness, for although she wanted to associate with Kardama Muni only for sense gratification, because he was spiritually great she was sure to be liberated by his benediction."

The first opportunity is the human form of life, and the second opportunity is to take birth in a suitable family where there is cultivation of spiritual knowledge; this is rarely obtained. The greatest opportunity is to have the association of a saintly person. Devah\u016bti was conscious that she was born as the daughter of an emperor. She was sufficiently educated and cultured, and at last she got Kardama Muni, a saintly person and a great yog\u012b, as her husband. Still, if she did not get liberation from the entanglement of material energy, then certainly she would be cheated by the insurmountable illusory energy. Actually, the illusory material energy is cheating everyone. People do not know what they are doing when they worship the material energy in the form of goddess K\u0101l\u012b or Durg\u0101 for material boons. They ask, \u201cMother, give me great riches, give me a good wife, give me fame, give me victory.\u201d But such devotees of the goddess M\u0101y\u0101, or Durg\u0101, do not know that they are being cheated by that goddess. Material achievement is actually no achievement because as soon as one is illusioned by the material gifts, he becomes more and more entangled, and there is no question of liberation. One should be intelligent enough to know how to utilize material assets for the purpose of spiritual realization. That is called karma-yoga or j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. Whatever we have we should use as service to the Supreme Person. It is advised in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sva-karma\u1e47\u0101 tam abhyarcya: one should try to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead by one\u2019s assets. There are many forms of service to the Supreme Lord, and anyone can render service unto Him according to the best of his ability."
