        "purport": " There are two kinds of householders. One is called the g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b, and the other is called the g\u1e5bhastha. The objective of the g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b is sense gratification, and the objective of the g\u1e5bhastha is self-realization. Here the Lord is speaking about the g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b, or the person who wants to remain in this material world. His activity is to enjoy material benefits by performing religious rituals for economic development and thereby ultimately satisfy the senses. He does not want anything more. Such a person works very hard throughout his life to become very rich and eat very nicely and drink. By giving some charity for pious activity he can go to a higher planetary atmosphere in the heavenly planets in his next life, but he does not want to stop the repetition of birth and death and finish with the concomitant miserable factors of material existence. Such a person is called a g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b. A g\u1e5bhastha is a person who lives with family, wife, children and relatives but has no attachment for them. He prefers to live in family life rather than as a mendicant or sanny\u0101s\u012b, but his chief aim is to achieve self-realization, or to come to the standard of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Here, however, Lord Kapiladeva is speaking about the g\u1e5bhamedh\u012bs, who have made their aim the materialistically prosperous life, which they achieve by sacrificial ceremonies, by charities and by good work. They are posted in good positions, and since they know that they are using up their assets of pious activities, they again and again perform activities of sense gratification. It is said by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, puna\u1e25 puna\u015b carvita-carva\u1e47\u0101n\u0101m: they prefer to chew the already chewed. Again and again they experience the material pangs, even if they are rich and prosperous, but they do not want to give up this kind of life."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20) it is said that persons who worship demigods have lost their intelligence: k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25. They are much attracted to sense gratification, and therefore they worship the demigods. It is, of course, recommended in the Vedic scriptures that if one wants money, health or education, then he should worship the various demigods. A materialistic person has manifold demands, and thus there are manifold demigods to satisfy his senses. The g\u1e5bhamedh\u012bs, who want to continue a prosperous materialistic way of life, generally worship the demigods or the forefathers by offering pi\u1e47\u1e0da, or respectful oblations. Such persons are bereft of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and are not interested in devotional service to the Lord. This kind of so-called pious and religious man is the result of impersonalism. The impersonalists maintain that the Supreme Absolute Truth has no form and that one can imagine any form he likes for his benefit and worship in that way. Therefore the g\u1e5bhamedh\u012bs or materialistic men say that they can worship any form of a demigod as worship of the Supreme Lord. Especially amongst the Hindus, those who are meat-eaters prefer to worship the goddess K\u0101l\u012b because it is prescribed that one can sacrifice a goat before that goddess. They maintain that whether one worships the goddess K\u0101l\u012b or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or any demigod, the destination is the same. This is first-class rascaldom, and such people are misled. But they prefer this philosophy. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 does not accept such rascaldom, and it is clearly stated that such methods are meant for persons who have lost their intelligence. The same judgment is confirmed here, and the word k\u0101ma-m\u016b\u1e0dha, meaning one who has lost his sense or is infatuated by the lust of attraction for sense gratification, is used. K\u0101ma-m\u016b\u1e0dhas are bereft of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service and are infatuated by a strong desire for sense gratification. The worshipers of demigods are condemned both in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

There are many heavenly planets to which they aspire just to achieve more and more material happiness by getting a long duration of life and the paraphernalia for sense enjoyment. But the attached persons do not know that even if one goes to the highest planet, Brahmaloka, destruction exists there also. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that one can even go to the Brahmaloka, but still he will find the pangs of birth, death, disease and old age. Only by approaching the Lord\u2019s abode, the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, does one not take birth again in this material world. The g\u1e5bhamedh\u012bs, or materialistic persons, however, do not like to use this advantage. They would prefer to transmigrate perpetually from one body to another, or from one planet to another. They do not want the eternal, blissful life in knowledge in the kingdom of God. There are two kinds of dissolutions. One dissolution takes place at the end of the life of Brahm\u0101. At that time all the planetary systems, including the heavenly systems, are dissolved in water and enter into the body of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who lies on the Garbhodaka Ocean on the bed of serpents, called \u015ae\u1e63a. In the other dissolution, which occurs at the end of Brahm\u0101\u2019s day, all the lower planetary systems are destroyed. When Lord Brahm\u0101 rises after his night, these lower planetary systems are again created. The statement in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that persons who worship the demigods have lost their intelligence is confirmed in this verse. These less intelligent persons do not know that even if they are promoted to the heavenly planets, at the time of dissolution they themselves, the demigods and all their planets will be annihilated. They have no information that eternal, blissful life can be attained."

        "purport": " The first-class example of this type of man is Arjuna. Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya, and his occupational duty was to fight. Generally, kings fight to extend their kingdoms, which they rule for sense gratification. But as far as Arjuna is concerned, he declined to fight for his own sense gratification. He said that although he could get a kingdom by fighting with his relatives, he did not want to fight with them. But when he was ordered by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and convinced by the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that his duty was to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then he fought. Thus he fought not for his sense gratification but for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Persons who work at their prescribed duties, not for sense gratification but for gratification of the Supreme Lord, are called ni\u1e25sa\u1e45ga, freed from the influence of the modes of material nature. Nyasta-karm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 indicates that the results of their activities are given to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such persons appear to be acting on the platform of their respective duties, but such activities are not performed for personal sense gratification; rather, they are performed for the Supreme Person.

In unpurified consciousness one thinks of himself as the Lord of the universe, but in purified consciousness one thinks himself the eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Putting oneself in that position of eternal servitorship to the Supreme Lord and working for Him perpetually, one actually becomes completely satisfied. As long as one works for his personal sense gratification, he will always be full of anxiety. That is the difference between ordinary consciousness and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Every one of us who has come to this material world has the sense of overlordship. This is called prav\u1e5btti.

He is the proprietor of the material and spiritual worlds and the supreme cause of manifestation. Material nature is only the ingredient because actually the manifestation is caused by His energy.

        "purport": " By perfecting their yogic practice, yog\u012bs can reach the highest planet, Brahmaloka, or Satyaloka, and after giving up their material bodies, they can enter into the body of Lord Brahm\u0101. Because they are not directly devotees of the Lord, they cannot get liberation directly. They have to wait until Brahm\u0101 is liberated, and only then, along with Brahm\u0101, are they also liberated. It is clear that as long as a living entity is a worshiper of a particular demigod, his consciousness is absorbed in thoughts of that demigod, and therefore he cannot get direct liberation, or entrance into the kingdom of God, nor can he merge into the impersonal effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such yog\u012bs or demigod worshipers are subjected to the chance of taking birth again when there is again creation."

The oneness of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers and the oneness of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophers are different. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b and Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophers both want to merge into the Supreme, but the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas do not lose their identities. They want to keep the identity of lover, parent, friend or servant. In the transcendental world, the servant and master are one. That is the absolute platform. Although the relationship is servant and master, both the servant and the served stand on the same platform. That is oneness. Lord Kapila advised His mother that she did not need any indirect process. She was already situated in that direct process because the Supreme Lord had taken birth as her son. Actually, she did not need any further instruction because she was already in the perfectional stage. Kapiladeva advised her to continue in the same way. He therefore addressed His mother as bh\u0101mini to indicate that she was already thinking of the Lord as her son. Devah\u016bti is advised by Lord Kapila to take directly to devotional service, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, because without that consciousness one cannot become liberated from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101."

        "translation": "My dear mother, someone may worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead with a special self-interest, but even demigods such as Lord Brahm\u0101, great sages such as Sanat-kum\u0101ra and great munis such as Mar\u012bci have to come back to the material world again at the time of creation. When the interaction of the three modes of material nature begins, Brahm\u0101, who is the creator of this cosmic manifestation and who is full of Vedic knowledge, and the great sages, who are the authors of the spiritual path and the yoga system, come back under the influence of the time factor. They are liberated by their nonfruitive activities and attain the first incarnation of the puru\u1e63a, but at the time of creation they come back in exactly the same forms and positions they previously had.",
        "purport": " That Brahm\u0101 becomes liberated is known to everyone, but he cannot liberate his devotees. Demigods like Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva cannot give liberation to any living entity. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, only one who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can be liberated from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. Brahm\u0101 is called here \u0101dya\u1e25 sthira-car\u0101\u1e47\u0101m. He is the original, first-created living entity, and after his own birth he creates the entire cosmic manifestation. He was fully instructed in the matter of creation by the Supreme Lord. Here he is called veda-garbha, which means that he knows the complete purpose of the Vedas. He is always accompanied by such great personalities as Mar\u012bci, Ka\u015byapa and the seven sages, as well as by great mystic yog\u012bs, the Kum\u0101ras and many other spiritually advanced living entities, but he has his own interest, separate from the Lord\u2019s. Bheda-d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dy\u0101 means that Brahm\u0101 sometimes thinks that he is independent of the Supreme Lord, or he thinks of himself as one of the three equally independent incarnations. Brahm\u0101 is entrusted with creation, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u maintains and Rudra, Lord \u015aiva, destroys. The three of them are understood to be incarnations of the Supreme Lord in charge of the three different material modes of nature, but none of them is independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here the word bheda-d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dy\u0101 occurs because Brahm\u0101 has a slight inclination to think that he is as independent as Rudra. Sometimes Brahm\u0101 thinks that he is independent of the Supreme Lord, and the worshiper also thinks that Brahm\u0101 is independent. For this reason, after the destruction of this material world, when there is again creation by the interaction of the material modes of nature, Brahm\u0101 comes back. Although Brahm\u0101 reaches the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the first puru\u1e63a incarnation, Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is full with transcendental qualities, he cannot stay in the spiritual world. The specific significance of his coming back may be noted. Brahm\u0101 and the great \u1e5b\u1e63is and the great master of yoga (\u015aiva) are not ordinary living entities; they are very powerful and have all the perfections of mystic yoga. But still they have an inclination to try to become one with the Supreme, and therefore they have to come back. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is accepted that as long as one thinks that he is equal with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is not completely purified or knowledgeable. In spite of going up to the first puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ra, Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, after the dissolution of this material creation, such personalities again fall down or come back to the material creation. It is a great falldown on the part of the impersonalists to think that the Supreme Lord appears within a material body and that one should therefore not meditate upon the form of the Supreme but should meditate instead on the formless. For this particular mistake, even the great mystic yog\u012bs or great stalwart transcendentalists also come back again when there is creation. All living entities other than the impersonalists and monists can directly take to devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and become liberated by developing transcendental loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such devotional service develops in the degrees of thinking of the Supreme Lord as master, as friend, as son and, at last, as lover. These distinctions in transcendental variegatedness must always be present."

Parame\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b means \u201cthe supreme person.\u201d As Brahm\u0101 is the supreme person within this universe, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality in the spiritual world. Lord Kapiladeva advises His mother that she should take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because it is worthwhile. Taking shelter of demigods, even those in the highest positions, like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, is not advised herein. One should take shelter of the Supreme Godhead. Sarva-bh\u0101vena means \u201cin all-loving ecstasy.\u201d Bh\u0101va is the preliminary stage of elevation before the attainment of pure love of Godhead. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, budh\u0101 bh\u0101va-samanvit\u0101\u1e25: one who has attained the stage of bh\u0101va can accept the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as worshipable. This is also advised here by Lord Kapila to His mother. Also significant in this verse is the phrase tad-gu\u1e47\u0101\u015brayay\u0101 bhakty\u0101. This means that discharging devotional service unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental; it is not material activity. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: those who engage in devotional service are accepted to be situated in the spiritual kingdom. Brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate: they at once become situated in the transcendental kingdom. Devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the only means for attaining the highest perfection of life for the human being. This is recommended herein by Lord Kapila to His mother. Bhakti is therefore nirgu\u1e47a, free from all tinges of material qualities. Although the discharge of devotional service appears to be like material activities, it is never sagu\u1e47a, or contaminated by material qualities. Tad-gu\u1e47\u0101\u015brayay\u0101 means that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental qualities are so sublime that there is no need to divert one\u2019s attention to any other activities. His behavior with the devotees is so exalted that a devotee need not try to divert his attention to any other worship. It is said that the demoniac P\u016btan\u0101 came to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by poisoning Him, but because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was pleased to suck her breast, she was given the same position as His mother. Devotees therefore pray that if a demon who wanted to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gets such an exalted position, why should they go to anyone other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for their worshipful attachment? There are two kinds of religious activities: one for material advancement and the other for spiritual advancement. By taking shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is endowed with both kinds of prosperity, material and spiritual. Why then should one go to any demigod?"

        "purport": " It is said by less intelligent men that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, is meant for persons who are not advanced in transcendental knowledge and renunciation. But the fact is that if one engages in the devotional service of the Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he does not have to attempt separately to practice detachment or to wait for an awakening of transcendental knowledge. It is said that one who engages unflinchingly in the devotional service of the Lord actually has all the good qualities of the demigods develop in him automatically. One cannot discover how such good qualities develop in the body of a devotee, but actually it happens. There is one instance where a hunter was taking pleasure in killing animals but after becoming a devotee he was not prepared to kill even an ant. Such is the quality of a devotee. Those who are very eager to advance in transcendental knowledge can engage themselves in pure devotional service, without wasting time in mental speculation. For arriving at the positive conclusions of knowledge in the Absolute Truth, the word brahma-dar\u015banam is significant in this verse. Brahma-dar\u015banam means to realize or to understand the Transcendence. One who engages in the service of V\u0101sudeva can actually realize what Brahman is. If Brahman is impersonal, then there is no question of dar\u015banam, which means \u201cseeing face to face.\u201d Dar\u015banam refers to seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva. Unless the seer and the seen are persons, there is no dar\u015banam. Brahma-dar\u015banam means that as soon as one sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can at once realize what impersonal Brahman is. A devotee does not need to make separate investigations to understand the nature of Brahman. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms this. Brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate: a devotee at once becomes a self-realized soul in the Absolute Truth."

The materialists conclusions of good and bad, moral and immoral, etc., are simply mental concoction or sentiment. Actually there is nothing good in the material world. In the spiritual field everything is absolutely good. There is no inebriety in the spiritual varieties.

        "purport": " The word d\u1e5b\u015by-\u0101dibhi\u1e25 is significant. According to J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, d\u1e5b\u015bi means j\u00f1\u0101na, philosophical research. By different processes of philosophical research under different concepts, such as the process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, the same Bhagav\u0101n, or Supreme Personality of Godhead, is understood as impersonal Brahman. Similarly, by the eightfold yoga system He appears as the Param\u0101tm\u0101. But in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or knowledge in purity, when one tries to understand the Absolute Truth, one realizes Him as the Supreme Person. The Transcendence is realized simply on the basis of knowledge. The words used here, param\u0101tme\u015bvara\u1e25 pum\u0101n, are all transcendental, and they refer to Supersoul. Supersoul is also described as puru\u1e63a, but the word Bhagav\u0101n directly refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is full of six opulences: wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. He is the Personality of Godhead in different spiritual skies. The various descriptions of param\u0101tm\u0101, \u012b\u015bvara and pum\u0101n indicate that the expansions of the Supreme Godhead are unlimited. Ultimately, to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead one has to accept bhakti-yoga. By executing j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga or dhy\u0101na-yoga one has to eventually approach the bhakti-yoga platform, and then Param\u0101tm\u0101, \u012b\u015bvara, pum\u0101n, etc., are all clearly understood. It is recommended in the Second Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that whether one is a devotee or fruitive actor or liberationist, if he is intelligent enough he should engage himself with all seriousness in the process of devotional service. It is also explained that whatever one desires which is obtainable by fruitive activities, even if one wants to be elevated to higher planets, can be achieved simply by execution of devotional service. Since the Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, He can bestow any one of them upon the worshiper. The one Supreme Personality of Godhead reveals Himself to different thinkers as the Supreme Person or impersonal Brahman or Param\u0101tm\u0101. Impersonalists merge into the impersonal Brahman, but that is not achieved by worshiping the impersonal Brahman. If one takes to devotional service and at the same time desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme Lord, he can achieve that. If someone desires at all to merge into the existence of the Supreme, he has to execute devotional service. The devotee can see the Supreme Lord face to face, but the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, or empiric philosopher, and the yog\u012b cannot. They cannot be elevated to the positions of associates of the Lord. There is no evidence in the scriptures stating that by cultivating knowledge or worshiping the impersonal Brahman one can become a personal associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nor by executing the yogic principles can one become an associate of the Supreme Godhead. Impersonal Brahman, being formless, is described as ad\u1e5b\u015bya because the impersonal effulgence of brahmajyoti covers the face of the Supreme Lord. Some yog\u012bs see the four-handed Vi\u1e63\u1e47u sitting within the heart, and therefore in their case also the Supreme Lord is invisible. Only for the devotees is the Lord visible. Here the statement d\u1e5b\u015by-\u0101dibhi\u1e25 is significant. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is both invisible and visible, there are different features of the Lord. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature and Brahman feature are invisible, but the Bhagav\u0101n feature is visible. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a this fact is very nicely explained. The universal form of the Lord and the formless Brahman effulgence of the Lord, being invisible, are inferior features. The concept of the universal form is material, and the concept of impersonal Brahman is spiritual, but the highest spiritual understanding is the Personality of Godhead. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a states, vi\u1e63\u1e47ur brahma-svar\u016bpe\u1e47a svayam eva vyavasthita\u1e25: Brahman\u2019s real feature is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or the Supreme Brahman is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Svayam eva: that is His personal feature. The supreme spiritual conception is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante tad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama. That specific abode called parama\u1e41 mama is the place from which, once one attains it, one does not return to this miserable, conditional life. Every place, every space and everything belongs to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but where He personally lives is tad dh\u0101ma paramam, His supreme abode. One has to make one\u2019s destination the supreme abode of the Lord."

The j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b thinks that matter is false and that Brahman is truth; therefore by cultivation of knowledge he tries to detach the senses from material enjoyment. The a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yog\u012bs also try to control the senses. The devotees, however, try to engage the senses in the service of the Lord. Therefore it appears that the activities of the bhaktas, devotees, are better than those of the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs. The mystic yog\u012bs simply try to control the senses by practicing the eight divisions of yoga \u2014 yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, etc. \u2014 and the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs try by mental reasoning to understand that sense enjoyment is false. But the easiest and most direct process is to engage the senses in the service of the Lord. The purpose of all yoga is to detach one\u2019s sense activities from this material world. The final aims, however, are different. J\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs want to become one with the Brahman effulgence, yog\u012bs want to realize Param\u0101tm\u0101, and devotees want to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and transcendental loving service to the Lord. That loving service is the perfect stage of sense control. The senses are actually active symptoms of life, and they cannot be stopped. They can be detached only if there is superior engagement. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate: the activities of the senses can be stopped if they are given superior engagements. The supreme engagement is engagement of the senses in the service of the Lord. That is the purpose of all yoga."

        "translation": "Those who are averse to the Transcendence realize the Supreme Absolute Truth differently through speculative sense perception, and therefore, because of mistaken speculation, everything appears to them to be relative.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is one, and He is spread everywhere by His impersonal feature. This is clearly expressed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cEverything that is experienced is but an expansion of My energy.\u201d Everything is sustained by Him, but that does not mean that He is in everything. Sense perceptions, such as aural perception of the sound of a drum, visual perception of a beautiful woman, or perception of the delicious taste of a milk preparation by the tongue, all come through different senses and are therefore differently understood. Therefore sensory knowledge is divided in different categories, although actually everything is one as a manifestation of the energy of the Supreme Lord. Similarly, the energies of fire are heat and illumination, and by these two energies fire can display itself in many varieties, or in diversified sense perception. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers declare this diversity to be false. But Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophers do not accept the different manifestations as false; they accept them as nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are a display of His diverse energies. The philosophy that the Absolute is true and this creation is false (brahma satya\u1e41 jagan mithy\u0101) is not accepted by Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophers. The example is given that although all that glitters is not gold, this does not mean that a glittering object is false. For example, an oyster shell appears to be golden; this appearance of golden hue is due only to the perception of the eyes, but that does not mean that the oyster shell is false. Similarly, by seeing the form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one cannot understand what He actually is, but this does not mean that He is false. The form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has to be understood as it is described in the books of knowledge such as Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. By our imperfect sense perception we cannot understand the form of the Lord. We have to acquire knowledge about Him. Therefore it is said here, j\u00f1\u0101nam ekam. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms that they are fools who, simply upon seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, consider Him a common man. They do not know the unlimited knowledge, power and opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Material sense speculation leads to the conclusion that the Supreme is formless. It is because of such mental speculation that the conditioned soul remains in ignorance under the spell of illusory energy. The Supreme Person has to be understood by the transcendental sound vibrated by Him in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, wherein He says that there is nothing superior to Himself; the impersonal Brahman effulgence is resting on His personality. The purified, absolute vision of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is compared to the river Ganges. Ganges water is so pure that it can purify even the asses and cows. But anyone who, disregarding the pure Ganges, wishes to be purified instead by the filthy water flowing in a drain, cannot be successful. Similarly, one can successfully attain pure knowledge of the Absolute only by hearing from the pure Absolute Himself. In this verse it is clearly said that those who are averse to the Supreme Personality of Godhead speculate with their imperfect senses about the nature of the Absolute Truth. The formless Brahman conception, however, can be received only by aural reception and not by personal experience. Knowledge is therefore acquired by aural reception. It is confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, \u015b\u0101stra-yonitv\u0101t: one has to acquire pure knowledge from the authorized scriptures. So-called speculative arguments about the Absolute Truth are therefore useless. The actual identity of the living entity is his consciousness, which is always present while the living entity is awake, dreaming or in deep sleep. Even in deep sleep, he can perceive by consciousness whether he is happy or distressed. Thus when consciousness is displayed through the medium of the subtle and gross material bodies, it is covered, but when the consciousness is purified, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one becomes free from the entanglement of repeated birth and death. When uncontaminated pure knowledge is uncovered from the modes of material nature, the actual identity of the living entity is discovered: he is eternally a servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The process of uncovering is like this: the rays of sunshine are luminous, and the sun itself is also luminous. In the presence of the sun, the rays illuminate just like the sun, but when the sunshine is covered by the spell of a cloud, or by m\u0101y\u0101, then darkness, the imperfection of perception, begins. Therefore, to get out of the entanglement of the spell of nescience, one has to awaken his spiritual consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in terms of the authorized scriptures."

Similarly, the entire universe has come from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Lord is described as mahat-pada, which means that the total material energy, known as the mahat-tattva, is lying at His lotus feet. The origin or the total energy of the cosmic manifestation is the mahat-tattva. From the mahat-tattva all the other twenty-four divisions have sprung, namely the eleven senses (including the mind), the five sense objects, the five material elements, and then consciousness, intelligence and false ego. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of the mahat-tattva, and therefore, in one sense, because everything is an emanation from the Supreme Lord, there is no difference between the Lord and the cosmic manifestation. But at the same time the cosmic manifestation is different from the Lord. The word svar\u0101\u1e6d is very significant here. Svar\u0101\u1e6d means \u201cindependent.\u201d The Supreme Lord is independent, and the individual soul is also independent. Although there is no comparison between the two qualities of independence, the living entity is minutely independent, and the Supreme Lord is fully independent. As the individual soul has a material body made of five elements and the senses, the supreme independent Lord similarly has the gigantic body of the universe. The individual body is temporary; similarly, the entire universe, which is considered to be the body of the Supreme Lord, is also temporary, and both the individual and universal bodies are products of the mahat-tattva. One has to understand the differences with intelligence. Everyone knows that his material body has developed from a spiritual spark, and similarly the universal body has developed from the supreme spark, Supersoul. As the individual body develops from the individual soul, the gigantic body of the universe develops from the Supreme Soul. Just as the individual soul has consciousness, the Supreme Soul is also conscious. But although there is a similarity between the consciousness of the Supreme Soul and the consciousness of the individual soul, the individual soul\u2019s consciousness is limited, whereas the consciousness of the Supreme Soul is unlimited. This is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.3). K\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a\u1e41 c\u0101pi m\u0101\u1e41 viddhi: the Supersoul is present in every field of activity, just as the individual soul is present in the individual body. Both of them are conscious. The difference is that the individual soul is conscious of the individual body only, whereas the Supersoul is conscious of the total number of individual bodies."

Either by devotional service directly or by philosophical research, one has to find the same destination, which is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " It is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that after many, many lives of philosophical research the wise man ultimately comes to the point of knowing that V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is everything, and therefore he surrenders unto Him. Such serious students in philosophical research are rare because they are very great souls. If by philosophical research one cannot come to the point of understanding the Supreme Person, then his task is not finished. His search in knowledge is still to be continued until he comes to the point of understanding the Supreme Lord in devotional service. The opportunity for direct touch with the Personality of Godhead is given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, where it is also said that those who take to other processes, namely the processes of philosophical speculation and mystic yoga practice, have much trouble. After many, many years of much trouble, a yog\u012b or wise philosopher may come to Him, but his path is very troublesome, whereas the path of devotional service is easy for everyone. One can achieve the result of wise philosophical speculation simply by discharging devotional service, and unless one reaches the point of understanding the Personality of Godhead by his mental speculation, all his research work is said to be simply a labor of love. The ultimate destination of the wise philosopher is to merge in the impersonal Brahman, but that Brahman is the effulgence of the Supreme Person. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.27), brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham am\u1e5btasy\u0101vyayasya ca: \u201cI am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is indestructible and is the supreme bliss.\u201d The Lord is the supreme reservoir of all pleasure, including Brahman pleasure; therefore, one who has unflinching faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead is said to be already realized in impersonal Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101."

        "translation": "A single object is appreciated differently by different senses due to its having different qualities. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is one, but according to different scriptural injunctions He appears to be different.",
        "purport": " It appears that by following the path of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, or empiric philosophical speculation, one reaches the impersonal Brahman, whereas by executing devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one enriches his faith in and devotion to the Personality of Godhead. But it is stated here that both bhakti-yoga and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga are meant for reaching the same destination \u2014 the Personality of Godhead. By the process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga the same Personality of Godhead appears to be impersonal. As the same object appears to be different when perceived by different senses, the same Supreme Lord appears to be impersonal by mental speculation. A hill appears cloudy from a distance, and one who does not know may speculate that the hill is a cloud. Actually, it is not a cloud; it is a big hill. One has to learn from authority that the sight of a cloud is not actually a cloud but a hill. If one makes a little more progress, then instead of a cloud he sees the hill and something green. When one actually approaches the hill, he will see many varieties. Another example is in perceiving milk. When we see milk, we see that it is white; when we taste it, it appears that milk is very palatable. When we touch milk, it appears very cold; when we smell milk, it appears to have a very good flavor; and when we hear, we understand that it is called milk. Perceiving milk with different senses, we say that it is something white, something very delicious, something very aromatic, and so on. Actually, it is milk. Similarly, those who are trying to find the Supreme Godhead by mental speculation may approach the bodily effulgence, or the impersonal Brahman, and those who are trying to find the Supreme Godhead by yoga practice may find Him as the localized Supersoul, but those who are directly trying to approach the Supreme Truth by practice of bhakti-yoga can see Him face to face as the Supreme Person. Ultimately, the Supreme Person is the destination of all different processes. The fortunate person who, by following the principles of scriptures, becomes completely purified of all material contamination, surrenders unto the Supreme Lord as everything. Just as one can appreciate the real taste of milk with the tongue and not with the eyes, nostrils or ears, one can similarly appreciate the Absolute Truth perfectly and with all relishable pleasure only through one path, devotional service. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti: if one wants to understand the Absolute Truth in perfection, he must take to devotional service. Of course, no one can understand the Absolute Truth in all perfection. That is not possible for the infinitesimal living entities. But the highest point of understanding by the living entity is reached by discharge of devotional service, not otherwise. By following various scriptural paths, one may come to the impersonal effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The transcendental pleasure derived from merging with or understanding the impersonal Brahman is very extensive because Brahman is ananta. Tad brahma ni\u1e63kala\u1e41 anantam: brahm\u0101nanda is unlimited. But that unlimited pleasure can also be surpassed. That is the nature of the Transcendence. The unlimited can be surpassed also, and that higher platform is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When one deals directly with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the mellow and the humor relished by reciprocation of devotional service is incomparable, even with the pleasure derived from transcendental Brahman. Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b therefore says that kaivalya, the Brahman pleasure, is undoubtedly very great and is appreciated by many philosophers, but to a devotee, who has understood how to derive pleasure from exchanging devotional service with the Lord, this unlimited Brahman appears to be hellish. Therefore one should try to transcend even the Brahman pleasure in order to approach the position of dealing with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a face to face. As the mind is the center of all the activities of the senses, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called the master of the senses, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba. The process is to fix the mind on H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a did (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25). Bhakti is the basic principle of all processes. Without bhakti, neither j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga nor a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga can be successful, and unless one approaches K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the principles of self-realization have no ultimate destination."

        "purport": " As it is stated in the previous verse, one has to follow the principles of the scriptures. There are different prescribed duties for persons in the different social and spiritual orders. Here it is stated that performance of fruitive activities and sacrifices and distribution of charity are activities meant for persons who are in the householder order of society. There are four orders of the social system: brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. For the g\u1e5bhasthas, or householders, performance of sacrifices, distribution of charity, and action according to prescribed duties are especially recommended. Similarly, austerity, study of Vedic literature, and philosophical research are meant for the v\u0101naprasthas, or retired persons. Study of the Vedic literature from the bona fide spiritual master is meant for the brahmac\u0101r\u012b, or student. \u0100tmendriya-jaya, control of the mind and taming of the senses, is meant for persons in the renounced order of life. All these different activities are prescribed for different persons so that they may be elevated to the platform of self-realization and from there to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional service. The words bhakti-yogena caiva hi mean that whatever is to be performed, as described in verse 34, whether yoga or sacrifice or fruitive activity or study of Vedic literature or philosophical research or acceptance of the renounced order of life, is to be executed in bhakti-yoga. The words caiva hi, according to Sanskrit grammar, indicate that one must perform all these activities mixed with devotional service, otherwise such activities will not produce any fruit. Any prescribed activity must be performed for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.27), yat karo\u1e63i yad a\u015bn\u0101si: \u201cWhatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you sacrifice, whatever austerities you undergo and whatever charities you give, the result should be given to the Supreme Lord.\u201d The word eva is added, indicating that one must execute activities in such a way. Unless one adds devotional service to all activities, he cannot achieve the desired result, but when bhakti-yoga is prominent in every activity, then the ultimate goal is sure. One has to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as it is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cAfter many, many births, one approaches the Supreme Person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and surrenders unto Him, knowing that He is everything.\u201d Also in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says, bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101m: \u201cFor anyone who is undergoing rigid austerity or for anyone performing different kinds of sacrifices, the beneficiary is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d He is the proprietor of all planets, and He is the friend of every living soul. The words dharme\u1e47obhaya-cihnena mean that the bhakti-yoga process contains two symptoms, namely attachment for the Supreme Lord and detachment from all material affinities. There are two symptoms of advancement in the process of devotional service, just as there are two processes taking place while eating. A hungry man feels strength and satisfaction from eating, and at the same time he gradually becomes detached from eating any more. Similarly, with the execution of devotional service, real knowledge develops, and one becomes detached from all material activities. In no other activity but devotional service is there such detachment from matter and attachment for the Supreme. There are nine different processes to increase this attachment to the Supreme Lord: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the Lord, making friendship, praying, offering everything and serving the lotus feet of the Lord. The processes for increasing detachment from material affinities are explained in verse 36. One can achieve elevation to the higher planetary systems like the heavenly kingdom by executing one\u2019s prescribed duties and by performing sacrifices. When one is transcendental to such desires because of accepting the renounced order of life, he can understand the Brahman feature of the Supreme, and when one is able to see his real constitutional position, he sees all other processes and becomes situated in the stage of pure devotional service. At that time he can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagav\u0101n. Understanding of the Supreme person is called \u0101tma-tattva-avabodhena, which means \u201cunderstanding of one\u2019s real constitutional position.\u201d If one actually understands one\u2019s constitutional position as an eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord, he becomes detached from the service of the material world. Everyone engages in some sort of service. If one does not know one\u2019s constitutional position, one engages in the service of his personal gross body or his family, society or country. But as soon as one is able to see his constitutional position (the word sva-d\u1e5bk means \u201cone who is able to see\u201d), he becomes detached from such material service and engages himself in devotional service. As long as one is in the modes of material nature and is performing the duties prescribed in the scriptures, he can be elevated to higher planetary systems, where the predominating deities are material representations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, like the sun-god, the moon-god, the air-god, Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. All the different demigods are material representations of the Supreme Lord. By material activities one can approach only such demigods, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25). Y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n: those who are attached to the demigods and who perform the prescribed duties can approach the abodes of the demigods. In this way, one can go to the planet of the Pit\u0101s, or forefathers. Similarly, one who fully understands the real position of his life adopts devotional service and realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " The process of bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the main river flowing down towards the sea of the Absolute Truth, and all other processes mentioned are just like tributaries. Lord Kapila is summarizing the importance of the process of devotional service. Bhakti-yoga, as described before, is divided into four divisions \u2014 three in the material modes of nature and one in transcendence, which is untinged by the modes of material nature. Devotional service mixed with the modes of material nature is a means for material existence, whereas devotional service without desires for fruitive result and without attempts for empirical philosophical research is pure, transcendental devotional service."

Also, there are so-called disciples who become submissive to a spiritual master most artificially, with an ulterior motive. They also cannot understand what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or devotional service is. Persons who, due to being initiated by another sect of religious faith, do not find devotional service as the common platform for approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead, also cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We have experience that some students come to join us, but because of being biased in some particular type of faith, they leave our camp and become lost in the wilderness. Actually, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not a sectarian religious faith; it is a teaching process for understanding the Supreme Lord and our relationship with Him. Anyone can join this movement without prejudice, but unfortunately there are persons who feel differently. Therefore it is better not to instruct the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to such persons. Generally, materialistic persons are after some name, fame and material gain, so if someone takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for these reasons, he will never be able to understand this philosophy. Such persons take to religious principles as a social decoration. They admit themselves into some cultural institution for the sake of name only, especially in this age. Such persons also cannot understand the philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Even if one is not greedy for material possessions but is too attached to family life, he also cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Superficially, such persons are not very greedy for material possessions, but they are too attached to wife, children and family improvement. When a person is not contaminated by the above-mentioned faults yet at the ultimate issue is not interested in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or if he is a nondevotee, he also cannot understand the philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " In the beginning, no one can be elevated to the highest stage of devotional service. Here bhakta means one who does not hesitate to accept the reformatory processes for becoming a bhakta. In order to become a devotee of the Lord, one has to accept a spiritual master and inquire from him about how to progress in devotional service. To serve a devotee, to chant the holy name according to a certain counting method, to worship the Deity, to hear \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam or Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from a realized person and to live in a sacred place where devotional service is not disturbed are the first out of sixty-four devotional activities for making progress in devotional service. One who has accepted these five chief activities is called a devotee. One must be prepared to offer the necessary respect and honor to the spiritual master. He should not be unnecessarily envious of his Godbrothers. Rather, if a godbrother is more enlightened and advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one should accept him as almost equal to the spiritual master, and one should be happy to see such godbrothers advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A devotee should always be very kind to the general public in instructing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because that is the only solution for getting out of the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. That is really humanitarian work, for it is the way to show mercy to other people who need it very badly. The word \u015bu\u015br\u016b\u1e63\u0101bhirat\u0101ya indicates a person who faithfully engages in serving the spiritual master. One should give personal service and all kinds of comforts to the spiritual master. A devotee who does so is also a bona fide candidate for taking this instruction. The word bahir j\u0101ta-vir\u0101g\u0101ya means a person who has developed detachment from external and internal material propensities. Not only is he detached from activities which are not connected to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but he should be internally averse to the material way of life. Such a person must be nonenvious and should think of the welfare of all living entities, not only of the human beings, but living entities other than human beings. The word \u015bucaye means one who is cleansed both externally and internally. To become actually cleansed externally and internally, one should chant the holy name of the Lord, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, constantly. The word d\u012byat\u0101m means that knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be offered by the spiritual master. The spiritual master must not accept a disciple who is not qualified; he should not be professional and should not accept disciples for monetary gains. The bona fide spiritual master must see the bona fide qualities of a person whom he is going to initiate. An unworthy person should not be initiated. The spiritual master should train his disciple in such a way so that in the future only the Supreme Personality of Godhead will be the dearmost goal of his life. In these two verses the qualities of a devotee are fully explained. One who has actually developed all the qualities listed in these verses is already elevated to the post of a devotee. If one has not developed all these qualities, he still has to fulfill these conditions in order to become a perfect devotee."
