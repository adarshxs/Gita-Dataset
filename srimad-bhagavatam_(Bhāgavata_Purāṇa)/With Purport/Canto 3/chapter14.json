Because the inquiries concerned the Lord, they were perfectly befitting a devotee. A devotee has no taste for hearing anything mundane. There are many topics of mundane warfare, but a devotee is not inclined to hear them. The topics of the warfare in which the Lord engages do not concern the war of death but the war against the chain of m\u0101y\u0101 which obliges one to accept repeated birth and death. In other words, one who takes delight in hearing the war topics of the Lord is relieved from the chains of birth and death. Foolish people are suspicious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s taking part in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, not knowing that His taking part insured liberation for all who were present on the battlefield.

For a conditioned soul, the wife is considered to be the source of liberation because she offers her service to the husband for his ultimate liberation. Conditional material existence is based on sense gratification, and if someone has the good fortune to get a good wife, he is helped by the wife in all respects. If one is disturbed in his conditional life, he becomes more and more entangled in material contamination. A faithful wife is supposed to cooperate with her husband in fulfilling all material desires so that he can then become comfortable and execute spiritual activities for the perfection of life. If, however, the husband is progressive in spiritual advancement, the wife undoubtedly shares in his activities, and thus both the wife and the husband profit in spiritual perfection. It is essential, therefore, that girls as well as boys be trained to discharge spiritual duties so that at the time of cooperation both will be benefited. The training of the boy is brahmacarya, and the training of the girl is chastity. A faithful wife and spiritually trained brahmac\u0101r\u012b are a good combination for advancement of the human mission."

But when husband and wife aim at spiritual advancement by mutual cooperation, there is no consideration of personal beauty or the disruption of so-called love. In the material world there is no question of love. Marriage is actually a duty performed in mutual cooperation as directed in the authoritative scriptures for spiritual advancement.

The bodily senses are considered plunderers of the fort of the body. The wife is supposed to be the commander of the fort, and therefore whenever there is an attack on the body by the senses, it is the wife who protects the body from being smashed. The sex demand is inevitable for everyone, but one who has a fixed wife is saved from the onslaught of the sense enemies. A man who possesses a good wife does not create a disturbance in society by corrupting virgin girls. Without a fixed wife, a man becomes a debauchee of the first order and is a nuisance in society \u2014 unless he is a trained brahmac\u0101r\u012b, v\u0101naprastha or sanny\u0101s\u012b. Unless there is rigid and systematic training of the brahmac\u0101r\u012b by the expert spiritual master, and unless the student is obedient, it is sure that the so-called brahmac\u0101r\u012b will fall prey to the attack of sex. There are so many instances of falldown, even for great yog\u012bs like Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra. A g\u1e5bhastha is saved, however, because of his faithful wife. Sex life is the cause of material bondage, and therefore it is prohibited in three \u0101\u015bramas and is allowed only in the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. The g\u1e5bhastha is responsible for producing first-quality brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, v\u0101naprasthas and sanny\u0101s\u012bs."

The man in the renounced order of life has no wife and may be driven by sex desire to seek another woman or another\u2019s wife and thus go to hell. In other words, the so-called man of the renounced order, who has left his house and wife, goes to hell if he again desires sexual pleasure, knowingly or unknowingly. In that way the householders are on the side of safety. Therefore husbands as a class cannot repay their debt to women either in this life or in the next. Even if they engage themselves in repaying the women throughout their whole lives, it is still not possible. Not all husbands are as able to appreciate the good qualities of their wives, but even though one is able to appreciate these qualities, it is still not possible to repay the debt to the wife. Such extraordinary praises by a husband for his wife are certainly in the mode of joking."

Since he is almost like Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, \u015aiva can see past, present and future. One of his eyes is like the sun, another is like the moon, and his third eye, which is between his eyebrows, is like fire. He can generate fire from his middle eye, and he is able to vanquish any powerful living entity, including Brahm\u0101, yet he does not live pompously in a nice house, etc., nor does he possess any material properties, although he is master of the material world. He lives mostly in the crematorium, where dead bodies are burnt, and the whirlwind dust of the crematorium is his bodily dress. He is unstained by material contamination. Ka\u015byapa took him as his younger brother because the youngest sister of Diti (Ka\u015byapa\u2019s wife) was married to Lord \u015aiva.

Diti might argue that they would enjoy sex life in a private place, but Ka\u015byapa reminded her that Lord \u015aiva has three eyes, called the sun, moon and fire, and one cannot escape his vigilance any more than one can escape Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Although seen by the police, a criminal is sometimes not immediately punished; the police wait for the proper time to apprehend him. The forbidden time for sexual intercourse would be noted by Lord \u015aiva, and Diti would meet with proper punishment by giving birth to a child of ghostly character or a godless impersonalist. Ka\u015byapa foresaw this, and thus he warned his wife Diti."

        "purport": " Ka\u015byapa informed his wife that just because Lord \u015aiva happened to be his brother-in-law, that should not encourage her in her offense towards him. Ka\u015byapa warned her that actually Lord \u015aiva is not connected with anyone, nor is anyone his enemy. Since he is one of the three controllers of the universal affairs, he is equal to everyone. His greatness is incomparable because he is a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said that among all the devotees of the Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015aiva is the greatest. Thus the remnants of foodstuff left by him are accepted by other devotees as mah\u0101-pras\u0101da, or great spiritual foodstuff. The remnants of foodstuff offered to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are called pras\u0101da, but when the same pras\u0101da is eaten by a great devotee like Lord \u015aiva, it is called mah\u0101-pras\u0101da. Lord \u015aiva is so great that he does not care for the material prosperity for which every one of us is so eager. P\u0101rvat\u012b, who is the powerful material nature personified, is under his full control as his wife, yet he does not use her even to build a residential house. He prefers to remain without shelter, and his great wife also agrees to live with him humbly. People in general worship Goddess Durg\u0101, the wife of Lord \u015aiva, for material prosperity, but Lord \u015aiva engages her in his service without material desire. He simply advises his great wife that of all kinds of worship, the worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the highest, and greater than that is the worship of a great devotee or anything in relation with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u."

Sometimes so-called devotees of Lord \u015aiva imitate him in using poisonous intoxicants. Lord \u015aiva once swallowed an ocean of poison, and thus his throat became blue.

Ka\u015byapa Muni meditated on the impersonal brahmajyoti by chanting the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra within his mouth. When a Vedic mantra is chanted within the mouth so that only the chanter can hear, the chanting is called japa. But when such mantras are chanted loudly, it is called k\u012brtana. The Vedic hymn Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare can be chanted both softly to oneself or loudly; therefore it is called the mah\u0101-mantra, or the great hymn. Ka\u015byapa Muni appears to be an impersonalist. Comparing his character with that of \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa as referred to above, it is clear that the personalist is stronger in sense control than the impersonalist. This is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate; i.e., one ceases to accept lower-grade things when one is situated in a superior condition. One is supposed to be purified after taking bath and chanting G\u0101yatr\u012b, but the mah\u0101-mantra is so powerful that one can chant loudly or softly, in any condition, and he is protected from all the evils of material existence."

        "purport": " The conditions for having good progeny in society are that the husband should be disciplined in religious and regulative principles and the wife should be faithful to the husband. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.11) it is said that sexual intercourse according to religious principles is a representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Before engaging in sexual intercourse, both the husband and the wife must consider their mental condition, the particular time, the husband\u2019s direction, and obedience to the demigods. According to Vedic society, there is a suitable auspicious time for sex life, which is called the time for garbh\u0101dh\u0101na. Diti neglected all the principles of scriptural injunction, and therefore, although she was very anxious for auspicious children, she was informed that her children would not be worthy to be the sons of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. There is a clear indication herein that a br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s son is not always a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Personalities like R\u0101va\u1e47a and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu were actually born of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but they were not accepted as br\u0101hma\u1e47as because their fathers did not follow the regulative principles for their birth. Such children are called demons, or R\u0101k\u1e63asas. There were only one or two R\u0101k\u1e63asas in the previous ages due to negligence of the disciplinary methods, but during the Age of Kali there is no discipline in sex life. How, then, can one expect good children? Certainly unwanted children cannot be a source of happiness in society, but through the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement they can be raised to the human standard by chanting the holy name of God. That is the unique contribution of Lord Caitanya to human society."

The Lord of the universe and of everything would appear to kill the sons of Diti because of their offending the devotees of the Lord. There are many agents of the Lord, such as Indra, Candra, Varu\u1e47a, and Goddess Durg\u0101, or K\u0101l\u012b, who can chastise any formidable miscreants in the world. The example of mountains being smashed by a thunderbolt is very appropriate. The mountain is considered the most strongly built body within the universe, yet it can be easily smashed by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not need to descend in order to kill any strongly built body; He comes down just for the sake of His devotees. Everyone is subject to the miseries offered by material nature, but because the activities of miscreants, such as killing innocent people and animals or torturing women, are harmful to everyone and are therefore a source of pain for the devotees, the Lord comes down. He descends only to give relief to His ardent devotees. The killing of the miscreant by the Lord is also the mercy of the Lord towards the miscreant, although apparently the Lord takes the side of the devotee. Since the Lord is absolute, there is no difference between His activities of killing the miscreants and favoring the devotees."

The Lord does not appear when the br\u0101hma\u1e47as become angry at someone, because the wrath of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is sufficient in itself. He certainly appears, however, when His devotee simply becomes sorry. A devotee of the Lord never prays to the Lord to appear for the sake of the troubles the miscreants cause for him, and he never bothers Him by asking for protection. Rather, the Lord is anxious to give protection to the devotees. Diti knew well that the killing of her sons by the Lord would also be His mercy, and therefore she says that the wheel and arms of the Lord are magnanimous. If someone is killed by the wheel of the Lord and is thus fortunate enough to see the arms of the Lord, that is sufficient for his liberation. Such good fortune is not achieved even by the great sages."

Although he was the emperor of this world, he was not profligate. Beginning from his childhood he was the reservoir of all good qualities. Without enumerating those qualities, it is said here summarily that he was endowed with all good qualities. That is the sign of a pure devotee. The most important characteristic of a pure devotee is that he is not lampa\u1e6da, or licentious, and another quality is that he is always eager to mitigate the miseries of suffering humanity. The most obnoxious misery of a living entity is his forgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A pure devotee, therefore, always tries to evoke everyone\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is the panacea for all miseries."

This direct vision is possible only for one who is highly elevated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for the Lord is not possible to see with material eyes. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has multifarious eternal forms such as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Baladeva, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Aniruddha, Pradyumna, V\u0101sudeva, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha and V\u0101mana, and the devotee of the Lord knows all those Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms. A pure devotee becomes attached to one of the eternal forms of the Lord, and the Lord is pleased to appear before him in the form desired. A devotee does not imagine something whimsical about the form of the Lord, nor does he ever think that the Lord is impersonal and can assume a form desired by the nondevotee. The nondevotee has no idea of the form of the Lord, and thus he cannot think of any one of the above-mentioned forms. But whenever a devotee sees the Lord, he sees Him in a most beautifully decorated form, accompanied by His constant companion the goddess of fortune, who is eternally beautiful."

As the wife of a great sage and the daughter of a great Praj\u0101pati, Dak\u1e63a, she knew that being killed by the Personality of Godhead is a great fortune. Since the Lord is absolute, His acts of violence and nonviolence are both on the absolute platform. There is no difference in such acts of the Lord. Mundane violence and nonviolence have nothing to do with the Lord\u2019s acts. A demon killed by Him attains the same result as one who attains liberation after many, many births of penance and austerity. The word bh\u1e5b\u015bam is significant herein because it indicates that Diti was pleased beyond her expectations."
