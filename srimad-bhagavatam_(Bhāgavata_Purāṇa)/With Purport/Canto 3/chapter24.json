It is explained here that spiritual knowledge vanquishes the knot of the heart. Matter and spirit are knotted by false ego. This identification of oneself with matter, which is called h\u1e5bdaya-granthi, exists for all conditioned souls, and it becomes more and more tightened when there is too much affection for sex life. The explanation was given by Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abha to His sons that this material world is an atmosphere of attraction between male and female. That attraction takes the shape of a knot in the heart, and by material affection it becomes still more tight. For people who hanker after material possessions, society, friendship and love, this knot of affection becomes very strong. It is only by brahma-bh\u0101vana \u2014 the instruction by which spiritual knowledge is enhanced \u2014 that the knot in the heart is cut to pieces. No material weapon is needed to cut this knot, but it requires bona fide spiritual instruction. Kardama Muni instructed his wife, Devah\u016bti, that the Lord would appear as her son and disseminate spiritual knowledge to cut the knot of material identification."

O great sage, she thus began to worship the master of the universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart.",
        "purport": " This is the process of spiritual realization; one has to receive instruction from a bona fide spiritual master. Kardama Muni was Devah\u016bti\u2019s husband, but because he instructed her on how to achieve spiritual perfection, he naturally became her spiritual master also. There are many instances wherein the husband becomes the spiritual master. Lord \u015aiva also is the spiritual master of his consort, P\u0101rvat\u012b. A husband should be so enlightened that he should become the spiritual master of his wife in order to enlighten her in the advancement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Generally str\u012b, or woman, is less intelligent than man; therefore, if the husband is intelligent enough, the woman gets a great opportunity for spiritual enlightenment. Here it is clearly said (samyak \u015braddh\u0101ya) that with great faith one should receive knowledge from the spiritual master and with great faith execute the performance of service. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, in his commentary on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, has especially stressed the instruction of the spiritual master. One should accept the instruction of the spiritual master as one\u2019s life and soul. Whether one is liberated or not liberated, one should execute the instruction of the spiritual master with great faith. It is also stated that the Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart. One does not have to seek the Lord outside; He is already there. One simply has to concentrate on one\u2019s worship in good faith, as instructed by the bona fide spiritual master, and one\u2019s efforts will come out successfully. It is also clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not appear as an ordinary child; He appears as He is. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, He appears by His own internal potency, \u0101tm\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101. And how does He appear? He appears when pleased by the worship of a devotee. A devotee may ask the Lord to appear as her son. The Lord is already sitting within the heart, and if He comes out from the body of a devotee it does not mean that the particular woman becomes His mother in the material sense. He is always there, but in order to please His devotee, He appears as her son."

Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha appeared from the pillar of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s palace, Lord Var\u0101ha appeared from the nostril of Brahm\u0101, and Lord Kapila appeared from the semen of Kardama, but this does not mean that the nostril of Brahm\u0101 or the pillar of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s palace or the semen of Kardama Muni is the source of the appearance of the Lord.

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Fifteenth Chapter, it is stated that the Lord Himself is the compiler of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra and is the perfect knower of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. Similarly, the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is compiled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His appearance as Kapila. There is an imitation Kapila who has a S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophical system, but Kapila the incarnation of God is different from that Kapila. Kapila the son of Kardama Muni, in His system of S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, very explicitly explained not only the material world but also the spiritual world. Brahm\u0101 could understand this fact because he is svar\u0101\u1e6d, almost independent in receiving knowledge. He is called svar\u0101\u1e6d because he did not go to any school or college to learn but learned everything from within. Because Brahm\u0101 is the first living creature within this universe, he had no teacher, his teacher was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, who is seated in the heart of every living creature. Brahm\u0101 acquired knowledge directly from the Supreme Lord within the heart; therefore he is sometimes called svar\u0101\u1e6d and aja. Another important point is stated here. Sattven\u0101\u1e41\u015bena: when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He brings with Him all His paraphernalia of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha; therefore His name, His form, His quality, His paraphernalia and His entourage all belong to the transcendental world. Real goodness is in the transcendental world. Here in the material world, the quality of goodness is not pure. Goodness may exist, but there must also be some tinges of passion and ignorance. In the spiritual world the unalloyed quality of goodness prevails; there the quality of goodness is called \u015buddha-sattva, pure goodness. Another name for \u015buddha-sattva is vasudeva because God is born from Vasudeva. Another meaning is that when one is purely situated in the qualities of goodness, he can understand the form, name, quality, paraphernalia and entourage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word a\u1e41\u015bena also indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appeared as Kapiladeva in a portion of His portion. God expands either as kal\u0101 or as a\u1e41\u015ba. A\u1e41\u015ba means \u201cdirect expansion,\u201d and kal\u0101 means \u201cexpansion of the expansion.\u201d There is no difference between the expansion, the expansion of the expansion, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly, as there is no difference between one candle and another \u2014 but still the candle from which the others are lit is called the original. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore called the Parabrahman, or the ultimate Godhead and cause of all causes."

Brahm\u0101 is therefore a liberated soul. Although he is in charge of this material world, he is not exactly like the common living entity. Since he is liberated from the majority of the follies of the common living entities, he was in knowledge of the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he therefore worshiped the Lord\u2019s activities, and with a glad heart he also praised Kardama Muni because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as Kapila, had appeared as his son. One who can become the father of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly a great devotee. There is a verse spoken by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in which he says that he does not know what the Vedas and what the Pur\u0101\u1e47as are, but while others might be interested in the Vedas or Pur\u0101\u1e47as, he is interested in Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who appeared as the father of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a wanted to worship Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as a child, crawled in the yard of his house. These are some of the good sentiments of devotees. If a recognized devotee brings forth the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his son, how he should be praised! Therefore Brahm\u0101 not only worshiped the incarnation of Godhead Kapila but also praised His so-called father, Kardama Muni."

Kardama Muni is one of the Praj\u0101patis, or creators of the living entities, and he is also a son of Brahm\u0101. Brahm\u0101 praises Kardama because he carried out the orders of the spiritual master in toto and without cheating. A conditioned soul in the material world has the disqualification of cheating. He has four disqualifications: he is sure to commit mistakes, he is sure to be illusioned, he is prone to cheat others, and his senses are imperfect. But if one carries out the order of the spiritual master by disciplic succession, or the parampar\u0101 system, he overcomes the four defects. Therefore, knowledge received from the bona fide spiritual master is not cheating. Any other knowledge which is manufactured by the conditioned soul is cheating only. Brahm\u0101 knew well that Kardama Muni exactly carried out the instructions received from him and that he actually honored his spiritual master. To honor the spiritual master means to carry out his instructions word for word."

I cannot carry it out.\u201d When he says that, he is fallen. The father and the spiritual master are on the same platform because a spiritual master is the second father. The higher classes are called dvija, twice-born. Whenever there is a question of birth, there must be a father. The first birth is made possible by the actual father, and the second birth is made possible by the spiritual master. Sometimes the father and the spiritual master may be the same man, and sometimes they are different men. In any case, the order of the father or the order of the spiritual master must be carried out without hesitation, with an immediate yes. There should be no argument. That is real service to the father and to the spiritual master. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has stated that the order of the spiritual master is the life and soul of the disciples. As a man cannot separate his life from his body, a disciple cannot separate the order of the spiritual master from his life. If a disciple follows the instruction of the spiritual master in that way, he is sure to become perfect. This is confirmed in the Upani\u1e63ads: the import of Vedic instruction is revealed automatically only to one who has implicit faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and in his spiritual master. One may be materially considered an illiterate man, but if he has faith in the spiritual master as well as in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then the meaning of scriptural revelation is immediately manifested before him."

        "purport": " The nine principal \u1e5b\u1e63is, or sages, are Mar\u012bci, Atri, A\u1e45gir\u0101, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bh\u1e5bgu, Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha and Atharv\u0101. All these \u1e5b\u1e63is are most important, and Brahm\u0101 desired that the nine daughters already born of Kardama Muni be handed over to them. Here two words are used very significantly \u2014 yath\u0101-\u015b\u012blam and yath\u0101-ruci. The daughters should be handed over to the respective \u1e5b\u1e63is, not blindly, but according to the combination of character and taste. That is the art of combining a man and woman. Man and woman should not be united simply on the consideration of sex life. There are many other considerations, especially character and taste. If the taste and character differ between the man and woman, their combination will be unhappy. Even about forty years ago, in Indian marriages, the taste and character of the boy and girl were first of all matched, and then they were allowed to marry. This was done under the direction of the respective parents. The parents used to astrologically determine the character and tastes of the boy and girl, and when they corresponded, the match was selected: \u201cThis girl and this boy are just suitable, and they should be married.\u201d Other considerations were less important. The same system was also advised in the beginning of the creation by Brahm\u0101: \u201cYour daughters should be handed over to the \u1e5b\u1e63is according to taste and character.\u201d According to astrological calculation, a person is classified according to whether he belongs to the godly or demoniac quality. In that way the spouse was selected. A girl of godly quality should be handed over to a boy of godly quality. A girl of demoniac quality should be handed over to a boy of demoniac quality. Then they will be happy. But if the girl is demoniac and the boy is godly, then the combination is incompatible; they cannot be happy in such a marriage. At the present moment, because boys and girls are not married according to quality and character, most marriages are unhappy, and there is divorce. It is foretold in the Twelfth Canto of the Bh\u0101gavatam that in this Age of Kali married life will be accepted on the consideration of sex only; when the boy and girl are pleased in sex, they get married, and when there is deficiency in sex, they separate. That is not actual marriage, but a combination of men and women like cats and dogs. Therefore the children produced in the modern age are not exactly human beings. Human beings must be twice-born. A child is first born of a good father and mother, and then he is born again of the spiritual master and the Vedas. The first mother and father bring about his birth into the world; then the spiritual master and the Vedas become his second father and mother. According to the Vedic system of marriage for producing children, every man and woman was enlightened in spiritual knowledge, and at the time of their combination to produce a child, everything was scrutinizingly and scientifically done."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is everlastingly, eternally the form of puru\u1e63a, the predominator or enjoyer, and when He appears He never accepts anything of this material energy.

The word sva-m\u0101yay\u0101, \u201cby His own internal potency,\u201d indicates that whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends He comes in His own energy. He may assume the body of a human being, but that body is not material. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is therefore clearly stated that only fools and rascals, m\u016b\u1e0dhas, consider the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the body of a common human being. The word \u015bevadhim means that He is the original bestower of all the necessities of life upon the living entities. In the Vedas also it is stated that He is the chief living entity and that He bestows all the desired necessities of other living entities. Because He is the bestower of the necessities of all others, He is called God. The Supreme is also a living entity; He is not impersonal. As we are individual, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is also individual \u2014 but He is the supreme individual. That is the difference between God and the ordinary living entities."

        "purport": " In this verse the activities and bodily features of Kapila Muni are very nicely described. The activities of Kapila Muni are forecast herein: He will present the philosophy of S\u0101\u1e45khya in such a way that by studying His philosophy people will be able to uproot the deep-rooted desire for karma, fruitive activities. Everyone in this material world engages in achieving the fruits of his labor. A man tries to be happy by achieving the fruits of his own honest labor, but actually he becomes more and more entangled. One cannot get out of this entanglement unless he has perfect knowledge, or devotional service. Those who are trying to get out of the entanglement by speculation are also doing their best, but in the Vedic scriptures we find that if one has taken to the devotional service of the Lord in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can very easily uproot the deep-rooted desire for fruitive activities. S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy will be broadcast by Kapila Muni for that purpose. His bodily features are also described herein. J\u00f1\u0101na does not refer to ordinary research work. J\u00f1\u0101na entails receiving knowledge from the scriptures through the spiritual master by disciplic succession. In the modern age there is a tendency to do research by mental speculation and concoction. But the man who speculates forgets that he himself is subject to the four defects of nature: he is sure to commit mistakes, his senses are imperfect, he is sure to fall into illusion, and he is cheating. Unless one has perfect knowledge from disciplic succession, he simply puts forth some theories of his own creation; therefore he is cheating people. J\u00f1\u0101na means knowledge received through disciplic succession from the scriptures, and vij\u00f1\u0101na means practical application of such knowledge. Kapila Muni\u2019s S\u0101\u1e45khya system of philosophy is based on j\u00f1\u0101na and vij\u00f1\u0101na."

        "purport": " Here the word avidy\u0101 is very significant. Avidy\u0101 means forgetfulness of one\u2019s identity. Every one of us is a spirit soul, but we have forgotten. We think, \u201cI am this body.\u201d This is called avidy\u0101. Sa\u1e41\u015baya-granthi means \u201cdoubtfulness.\u201d The knot of doubtfulness is tied when the soul identifies with the material world. That knot is also called aha\u1e45k\u0101ra, the junction of matter and spirit. By proper knowledge received from the scriptures in disciplic succession and by proper application of that knowledge, one can free himself from this binding combination of matter and spirit. Brahm\u0101 assures Devah\u016bti that her son will enlighten her, and after enlightening her He will travel all over the world, distributing the system of S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy. The word sa\u1e41\u015baya means \u201cdoubtful knowledge.\u201d Speculative and pseudo yogic knowledge is all doubtful. At the present moment the so-called yoga system is prosecuted on the understanding that by agitation of the different stations of the bodily construction one can find that he is God. The mental speculators think similarly, but they are all doubtful. Real knowledge is expounded in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cJust become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Just worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d That is real knowledge, and anyone who follows that system becomes perfect without a doubt."

From the prayers of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, we understand that He appears garbed as a devotee in Kali-yuga. Lord Caitanya is that devotee. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared in the form of a devotee, but although He never disclosed Himself, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b could understand His identity, for the Lord cannot hide Himself from a pure devotee. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b detected Him when he offered his first obeisances to Lord Caitanya. He knew that Lord Caitanya was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself and therefore offered his obeisances with the following words: \u201cI offer my respects to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has now appeared as Lord Caitanya.\u201d This is also confirmed in the prayers of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja: in Kali-yuga He does not directly appear, but He appears as a devotee. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is therefore known as tri-yuga. Another explanation of tri-yuga is that He has three pairs of divine attributes, namely power and affluence, piety and renown, and wisdom and dispassion. According to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, His three pairs of opulences are complete riches and complete strength, complete fame and complete beauty, and complete wisdom and complete renunciation. There are different interpretations of tri-yuga, but it is accepted by all learned scholars that tri-yuga means Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. When Kardama Muni understood that his son, Kapila, was Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Himself, he wanted to offer his obeisances. Therefore, when Kapila was alone he offered his respects and expressed his mind as follows."

In other words, devotional service to the Lord is so easy that even a householder can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as one of the members of his household, as his son, as Kardama Muni experienced. He was a householder, although a yog\u012b, but he had the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapila Muni as his son. Devotional service is such a powerful transcendental method that it surpasses all other methods of transcendental realization. The Lord therefore says that He lives neither in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha nor in the heart of a yog\u012b, but He lives where His pure devotees are always chanting and glorifying Him. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as bhakta-vatsala. He is never described as j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b-vatsala or yog\u012b-vatsala. He is always described as bhakta-vatsala because He is more inclined toward His devotees than toward other transcendentalists.

        "purport": " In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Lord is one Absolute, but He has ananta, or innumerable, forms. Advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam. The Lord is the original form, but still He has multiforms. Those multiforms are manifested by Him transcendentally, according to the tastes of His multidevotees. It is understood that once Hanum\u0101n, the great devotee of Lord R\u0101macandra, said that he knew that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the husband of Lak\u1e63m\u012b, and R\u0101ma, the husband of S\u012bt\u0101, are one and the same, and that there is no difference between Lak\u1e63m\u012b and S\u012bt\u0101, but as for himself, he liked the form of Lord R\u0101ma. In a similar way, some devotees worship the original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When we say \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u201d we refer to all forms of the Lord \u2014 not only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, etc. The varieties of transcendental forms exist simultaneously. That is also stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u \u2026 n\u0101n\u0101vat\u0101ram. He already exists in multiforms, but none of the forms are material. \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has commented that ar\u016bpi\u1e47a\u1e25, \u201cwithout form,\u201d means without material form. The Lord has form, otherwise how can it be stated here, t\u0101ny eva te\u00a0\u2019bhir\u016bp\u0101\u1e47i r\u016bp\u0101\u1e47i bhagava\u1e41s tava: \u201cYou have Your forms, but they are not material. Materially You have no form, but spiritually, transcendentally, You have multiforms\u201d? M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers cannot understand these transcendental forms of the Lord, and being disappointed, they say that the Supreme Lord is impersonal. But that is not a fact; whenever there is form there is a person. Many times in many Vedic literatures the Lord is described as puru\u1e63a, which means \u201cthe original form, the original enjoyer.\u201d The conclusion is that the Lord has no material form, and yet, according to the liking of different grades of devotees, He simultaneously exists in multiforms, such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and Mukunda. There are many thousands and thousands of forms, but they are all vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "purport": " The six opulences \u2014 wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation \u2014 are indicated here by Kardama Muni, who addresses Kapila Muni, his son, as param. The word param is used in the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, in the phrase para\u1e41 satyam, to refer to the summum bonum, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Param is explained further by the next word, pradh\u0101nam, which means the chief, the origin, the source of everything \u2014 sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am \u2014 the cause of all causes. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not formless; He is puru\u1e63am, or the enjoyer, the original person. He is the time element and is all-cognizant. He knows everything \u2014 past, present and future \u2014 as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord says, \u201cI know everything \u2014 present, past and future \u2014 in every corner of the universe.\u201d The material world, which is moving under the spell of the three modes of nature, is also a manifestation of His energy. Par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate: everything that we see is an interaction of His energies (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.8). Parasya brahma\u1e47a\u1e25 \u015baktis tathedam akhila\u1e41 jagat. This is the version of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a. We can understand that whatever we see is an interaction of the three modes of material nature, but actually it is all an interaction of the Lord\u2019s energy. Loka-p\u0101lam: He is actually the maintainer of all living entities. Nityo nity\u0101n\u0101m: He is the chief of all living entities; He is one, but He maintains many, many living entities. God maintains all other living entities, but no one can maintain God. That is His svacchanda-\u015bakti; He is not dependent on others. Someone may call himself independent, but he is still dependent on someone higher. The Personality of Godhead, however, is absolute; there is no one higher than or equal to Him. Kapila Muni appeared as the son of Kardama Muni, but because Kapila is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kardama Muni offered respectful obeisances unto Him with full surrender. Another word in this verse is very important: \u0101tm\u0101nubh\u016bty\u0101nugata-prapa\u00f1cam. The Lord descends either as Kapila or R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha or Var\u0101ha, and whatever forms He assumes in the material world are all manifestations of His own personal internal energy. They are never forms of the material energy. The ordinary living entities who are manifested in this material world have bodies created by the material energy, but when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or any one of His expansions or parts of the expansions descends to this material world, although He appears to have a material body, His body is not material. He always has a transcendental body. But fools and rascals, who are called m\u016b\u1e0dhas, consider Him one of them, and therefore they deride Him. They refuse to accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they cannot understand Him. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25: \u201cThose who are rascals and fools deride Me.\u201d When God descends in a form, this does not mean that He assumes His form with the help of the material energy. He manifests His spiritual form as He exists in His spiritual kingdom."

Since I have now been liberated by You from my debts to my father, and since all my desires are fulfilled, I wish to accept the order of an itinerant mendicant.

        "purport": " Actually, sanny\u0101sa, or renunciation of material household life, necessitates complete absorption in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and immersion in the self. One does not take sanny\u0101sa, freedom from family responsibility in the renounced order of life, to make another family or to create an embarrassing transcendental fraud in the name of sanny\u0101sa. The sanny\u0101s\u012b\u2019s business is not to become proprietor of so many things and amass money from the innocent public. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is proud that he is always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within himself. Of course, there are two kinds of devotees of the Lord. One is called go\u1e63\u1e6dhy\u0101nand\u012b, which means those who are preachers and have many followers for preaching the glories of the Lord and who live among those many, many followers just to organize missionary activities. Other devotees are \u0101tm\u0101nand\u012b, or self-satisfied, and do not take the risk of preaching work. They therefore remain alone with God. In this classification was Kardama Muni. He wanted to be free from all anxieties and remain alone within his heart with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Parivr\u0101ja means \u201can itinerant mendicant.\u201d A mendicant sanny\u0101s\u012b should not live anywhere for more than three days. He must be always moving because his duty is to move from door to door and enlighten people about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "translation": "The Personality of Godhead Kapila said: Whatever I speak, whether directly or in the scriptures, is authoritative in all respects for the people of the world. O Muni, because I told you before that I would become your son, I have descended to fulfill this truth.",
        "purport": " Kardama Muni was to leave his family life to completely engage in the service of the Lord. But since he knew that the Lord Himself, as Kapila, had taken birth in his home as his own son, why was he preparing to leave home to search out self-realization or God realization? God Himself was present in his home \u2014 why should he leave home? Such a question may certainly arise. But here it is said that whatever is spoken in the Vedas and whatever is practiced in accordance with the injunctions of the Vedas is to be accepted as authoritative in society. Vedic authority says that a householder must leave home after his fiftieth year. Pa\u00f1c\u0101\u015bordhva\u1e41 vana\u1e41 vrajet: one must leave his family life and enter the forest after the age of fifty. This is an authoritative statement of the Vedas, based on the division of social life into four departments of activity \u2014 brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. Kardama Muni practiced yoga very rigidly as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b before his marriage, and he became so powerful and attained so much mystic power that his father, Brahm\u0101, ordered him to marry and beget children as a householder. Kardama did that also; he begot nine good daughters and one son, Kapila Muni, and thus his householder duty was also performed nicely, and now his duty was to leave. Even though he had the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his son, he had to respect the authority of the Vedas. This is a very important lesson. Even if one has God in his home as his son, one should still follow the Vedic injunctions. It is stated, mah\u0101jano yena gata\u1e25 sa panth\u0101\u1e25: one should traverse the path which is followed by great personalities. Kardama Muni\u2019s example is very instructive, for in spite of having the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his son, he left home just to obey the authority of the Vedic injunction. Kardama Muni states here the main purpose of his leaving home: while traveling all over the world as a mendicant, he would always remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart and thereby be freed from all the anxieties of material existence. In this Age of Kali-yuga sanny\u0101sa is prohibited because persons in this age are all \u015b\u016bdras and cannot follow the rules and regulations of sanny\u0101sa life. It is very commonly found that so-called sanny\u0101s\u012bs are addicted to nonsense \u2014 even to having private relationships with women. This is the abominable situation in this age. Although they dress themselves as sanny\u0101s\u012bs, they still cannot free themselves from the four principles of sinful life, namely illicit sex life, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Since they are not freed from these four principles, they are cheating the public by posing as sv\u0101m\u012bs. In Kali-yuga the injunction is that no one should accept sanny\u0101sa. Of course, those who actually follow the rules and regulations must take sanny\u0101sa. Generally, however, people are unable to accept sanny\u0101sa life, and therefore Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu stressed, kalau n\u0101sty eva n\u0101sty eva nasty eva gatir anyath\u0101. In this age there is no other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative than to chant the holy name of the Lord: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare. The main purpose of sanny\u0101sa life is to be in constant companionship with the Supreme Lord, either by thinking of Him within the heart or hearing of Him through aural reception. In this age, hearing is more important than thinking because one\u2019s thinking may be disturbed by mental agitation, but if one concentrates on hearing, he will be forced to associate with the sound vibration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the sound vibration \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u201d are nondifferent, so if one loudly vibrates Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will be able to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately. This process of chanting is the best process of self-realization in this age; therefore Lord Caitanya preached it so nicely for the benefit of all humanity."

Dur refers to trouble or du\u1e25kha, miseries. \u0100\u015bay\u0101t means \u201cfrom the shelter.\u201d We conditioned souls have taken shelter of the material body, which is full of troubles and miseries. Foolish people cannot understand the situation, and this is called ignorance, illusion, or the spell of m\u0101y\u0101. Human society should very seriously understand that the body itself is the source of all miserable life. Modern civilization is supposed to be making advancement in scientific knowledge, but what is this scientific knowledge? It is based on bodily comforts only, without knowledge that however comfortably one maintains his body, the body is destructible. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, antavanta ime deh\u0101\u1e25: these bodies are destined to be destroyed. Nityasyokt\u0101\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25 refers to the living soul, or the living spark, within the body. That soul is eternal, but the body is not eternal. For our activity we must have a body; without a body, without sense organs, there is no activity. But people are not inquiring whether it is possible to have an eternal body. Actually they aspire for an eternal body because even though they engage in sense enjoyment, that sense enjoyment is not eternal. They are therefore in want of something which they can enjoy eternally, but they do not understand how to attain that perfection. S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, therefore, as stated herein by Kapila-deva, is tattv\u0101n\u0101m. The S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy system is designed to afford understanding of the real truth. What is that real truth? The real truth is knowledge of how to get out of the material body, which is the source of all trouble. Lord Kapila\u2019s incarnation, or descent, is especially meant for this purpose. That is clearly stated here."

        "purport": " It is not true that S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is a new system of philosophy introduced by Kapila as material philosophers introduce new kinds of mental speculative thought to supersede that of another philosopher. On the material platform, everyone, especially the mental speculator, tries to be more prominent than others. The field of activity of the speculators is the mind. There is no limit to the different ways in which one can agitate the mind, and thus one can put forward an unlimited number of theories. S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is not like that; it is not mental speculation. It is factual, but at the time of Kapila it was lost. In due course of time, a particular type of knowledge may be lost or may be covered for the time being; that is the nature of this material world. A similar statement was made by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Sa k\u0101leneha mahat\u0101 yogo na\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25: \u201cIn course of time the yoga system as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was lost.\u201d It was coming in parampar\u0101, in disciplic succession, but due to the passage of time it was lost. The time factor is so pressing that in the course of time everything within this material world is spoiled or lost. The yoga system of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was lost before the meeting of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a again enunciated the same ancient yoga system to Arjuna, who could actually understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Similarly, Kapila also said that the system of S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy was not exactly being introduced by Him; it was already current, but in course of time it was mysteriously lost, and therefore He appeared to reintroduce it. That is the purpose of the incarnation of Godhead. Yad\u0101 yad\u0101 hi dharmasya gl\u0101nir bhavati bh\u0101rata. Dharma means the real occupation of the living entity. When there is a discrepancy in the eternal occupation of the living entity, the Lord comes and introduces the real occupation of life. Any so-called religious system that is not in the line of devotional service is called adharma-sa\u1e41sth\u0101pana. When people forget their eternal relationship with God and engage in something other than devotional service, their engagement is called irreligion. How one can get out of the miserable condition of material life is stated in S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, and the Lord Himself is explaining this sublime system."

Birth and death are natural to this material body.

Actually, human life is meant for conquering the insurmountable process of birth and death. That can be done as stated here. M\u0101\u1e41 bhaja: one must engage in the devotional service of the Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also the Lord says, man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakta\u1e25: \u201cJust become My devotee.

        "purport": " People are very anxious to understand the Absolute Truth in various ways, especially by experiencing the brahmajyoti, or Brahman effulgence, by meditation and by mental speculation. But Kapiladeva uses the word m\u0101m to emphasize that the Personality of Godhead is the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Personality of Godhead always says m\u0101m, \u201cunto Me,\u201d but the rascals misinterpret the clear meaning. M\u0101m is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He appears in different incarnations and understand that He has not assumed a material body but is present in His own eternal, spiritual form, then one can understand the nature of the Personality of Godhead. Since the less intelligent cannot understand this point, it is stressed everywhere again and again. Simply by seeing the form of the Lord as He presents Himself by His own internal potency as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or R\u0101ma or Kapila, one can directly see the brahmajyoti, because the brahmajyoti is no more than the effulgence of His bodily luster. Since the sunshine is the luster of the sun planet, by seeing the sun one automatically sees the sunshine; similarly, by seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead one simultaneously sees and experiences the Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature as well as the impersonal Brahman feature of the Supreme. The Bh\u0101gavatam has already enunciated that the Absolute Truth is present in three features \u2014 in the beginning as the impersonal Brahman, in the next stage as the Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s heart, and, at last, as the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth, Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who sees the Supreme Person can automatically realize the other features, namely the Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Brahman features of the Lord. The words used here are vi\u015boko\u00a0\u2019bhayam \u1e5bcchasi. Simply by seeing the Personality of Godhead one realizes everything, and the result is that one becomes situated on the platform where there is no lamentation and no fear. This can be attained simply by devotional service to the Personality of Godhead."

A very good example is set here: the husband goes away, taking the sanny\u0101sa order for self-realization, but his representative, the son, who is equally educated, remains at home to deliver the mother. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is not supposed to take his wife with him. At the v\u0101naprastha stage of retired life, or the stage midway between householder life and renounced life, one may keep his wife as an assistant without sex relations, but in the sanny\u0101sa order of life one cannot keep his wife with him. Otherwise, a person like Kardama Muni could have kept his wife with him, and there would have been no hindrance to his prosecution of self-realization. Kardama Muni followed the Vedic injunction that no one in sanny\u0101sa life can have any kind of relationship with women. But what is the position of a woman who is left by her husband? She is entrusted to the son, and the son promises that he will deliver his mother from entanglement. A woman is not supposed to take sanny\u0101sa. So-called spiritual societies concocted in modern times give sanny\u0101sa even to women, although there is no sanction in the Vedic literature for a woman\u2019s accepting sanny\u0101sa. Otherwise, if it were sanctioned, Kardama Muni could have taken his wife and given her sanny\u0101sa. The woman must remain at home. She has only three stages of life: dependency on the father in childhood, dependency on the husband in youth and, in old age, dependency on the grown-up son, such as Kapila. In old age the progress of woman depends on the grown-up son. The ideal son, Kapila Muni, is assuring His father of the deliverance of His mother so that His father may go peacefully without anxiety for his good wife."

        "purport": " Going to the forest is compulsory for everyone. It is not a mental excursion upon which one person goes and another does not. Everyone should go to the forest at least as a v\u0101naprastha. Forest-going means to take one-hundred-percent shelter of the Supreme Lord, as explained by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja in his talks with his father. Sad\u0101 samudvigna-dhiy\u0101m (Bh\u0101g. 7.5.5). People who have accepted a temporary, material body are always full of anxieties. One should therefore not be very much affected by this material body, but should try to be freed. The preliminary process to become freed is to go to the forest or give up family relationships and exclusively engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is the purpose of going to the forest. Otherwise, the forest is only a place of monkeys and wild animals. To go to the forest does not mean to become a monkey or a ferocious animal. It means to accept exclusively the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engage oneself in full service. One does not actually have to go to the forest. At the present moment this is not at all advisable for a man who has spent his life all along in big cities. As explained by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja (hitv\u0101tma-p\u0101ta\u1e41 g\u1e5bham andha-k\u016bpam), one should not remain always engaged in the responsibilities of family life because family life without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is just like a blind well. Alone in a field, if one falls into a blind well and no one is there to save him, he may cry for years, and no one will see or hear where the crying is coming from. Death is sure. Similarly, those who are forgetful of their eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord are in the blind well of family life; their position is very ominous. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja advised that one should give up this well somehow or other and take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thus be freed from material entanglement, which is full of anxieties."

        "purport": " Here the words anagnir aniketana\u1e25 are very significant. A sanny\u0101s\u012b should be completely detached from fire and any residential quarters. A g\u1e5bhastha has a relationship with fire, either for offering sacrifices or for cooking, but a sanny\u0101s\u012b is freed from these two responsibilities. He does not have to cook or offer fire for sacrifice because he is always engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; therefore he has already accomplished all ritualistic performances of religion. Aniketana\u1e25 means \u201cwithout lodging.\u201d He should not have his own house, but should depend completely on the Supreme Lord for his food and lodging. He should travel. Mauna means \u201csilence.\u201d Unless one becomes silent, he cannot think completely about the pastimes and activities of the Lord. It is not that because one is a fool and cannot speak nicely he therefore takes the vow of mauna. Rather, one becomes silent so that people will not disturb him. It is said by C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita that a rascal appears very intelligent as long as he does not speak. But speaking is the test. The so-called silence of a silent impersonalist sv\u0101m\u012b indicates that he has nothing to say; he simply wants to beg. But the silence adopted by Kardama Muni was not like that. He became silent for relief from nonsensical talk. One is called a muni when he remains grave and does not talk nonsense. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a set a very good example; whenever he spoke, he spoke about the pastimes of the Lord. Mauna necessitates refraining from nonsensical talking, and engaging the talking facility in the pastimes of the Lord. In that way one can chant and hear about the Lord in order to perfect his life. Vratam means that one should take a vow as explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, am\u0101nitvam adambhitvam, without hankering for personal respect and without being proud of one\u2019s material position. Ahi\u1e41s\u0101 means not being violent. There are eighteen processes for attaining knowledge and perfection, and by his vow, Kardama Muni adopted all the principles of self-realization."

Kardama Muni fixed his mind on the Supreme Brahman and realized Him through bhakti, or devotional service.

Gu\u1e47\u0101vabh\u0101se: He is beyond the three modes of material nature, but it is due to Him that the three modes of material nature are manifested. In other words, although the material energy is an emanation of the Supreme Lord, He is not affected, as we are, by the modes of material nature. We are conditioned souls, but He is not affected, although the material nature has emanated from Him. He is the supreme living entity and is never affected by m\u0101y\u0101, but we are subordinate, minute living entities, prone to be affected by the limitations of m\u0101y\u0101.

This very example is also cited in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: one should become like the ocean. The ocean is filled by many thousands of rivers, and millions of tons of its water evaporates into clouds, yet the ocean is the same unagitated ocean. The laws of nature may work, but if one is fixed in devotional service at the lotus feet of the Lord, he is not agitated, for he is introspective. He does not look outside to material nature, but he looks in to the spiritual nature of his existence; with a sober mind, he simply engages in the service of the Lord. Thus he realizes his own self without false identification with matter and without affection for material possessions. Such a great devotee is never in trouble with others because he sees everyone from the platform of spiritual understanding; he sees himself and others in the right perspective."

        "purport": " When one engages in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord one becomes aware that his constitutional position, as an individual soul, is to be eternally a servitor of the Supreme Lord, V\u0101sudeva. Self-realization does not mean that because the Supreme Soul and the individual soul are both souls they are equal in every respect. The individual soul is prone to be conditioned, and the Supreme Soul is never conditioned. When the conditioned soul realizes that he is subordinate to the Supreme Soul, his position is called labdh\u0101tm\u0101, self-realization, or mukta-bandhana, freedom from material contamination. Material contamination continues as long as one thinks that he is as good as the Supreme Lord or is equal with Him. This condition is the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101. M\u0101y\u0101 always influences the conditioned soul. Even after much meditation and speculation, if one continues to think himself one with the Supreme Lord, it is to be understood that he is still in the last snares of the spell of m\u0101y\u0101. The word pare\u1e47a is very significant. Para means \u201ctranscendental, untinged by material contamination.\u201d Full consciousness that one is an eternal servant of the Lord is called par\u0101 bhakti. If one has any identification with material things and executes devotional service for attainment of some material gain, that is viddh\u0101 bhakti, contaminated bhakti. One can actually become liberated by execution of par\u0101 bhakti. Another word mentioned here is sarva j\u00f1e. The Supersoul sitting within the heart is all-cognizant. He knows. I may forget my past activities due to the change of body, but because the Supreme Lord as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is sitting within me, He knows everything; therefore the result of my past karma, or past activities, is awarded to me. I may forget, but He awards me suffering or enjoyment for the misdeeds or good deeds of my past life. One should not think that he is freed from reaction because he has forgotten the actions of his past life. Reactions will take place, and what kind of reactions there will be is judged by the Supersoul, the witness."

This mysterious position has to be understood by highly advanced devotees. There are three kinds of devotees \u2014 the neophyte devotee, the intermediate devotee and the advanced devotee. The neophyte devotee does not understand the techniques of devotional science, but simply offers devotional service to the Deity in the temple.
