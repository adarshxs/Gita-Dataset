        "purport": " The word nirvyal\u012bka is very significant. The prayers of the demigods or devotees of the Lord are free from all sinful purposes, but the prayers of demons are always filled with sinful purposes. The demon Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a became powerful by deriving a boon from Brahm\u0101, and after attaining that boon he created a disturbance because of his sinful intentions. The prayers of Brahm\u0101 and other demigods are not to be compared to the prayers of the demons. Their purpose is to please the Supreme Lord; therefore the Lord smiled and accepted the prayer to kill the demon. Demons, who are never interested in praising the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they have no information of Him, go to the demigods, and in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this is condemned. Persons who go to the demigods and pray for advancement in sinful activities are considered to be bereft of all intelligence. Demons have lost all intelligence because they do not know what is actually their self-interest. Even if they have information of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they decline to approach Him; it is not possible for them to get their desired boons from the Supreme Lord because their purposes are always sinful. It is said that the dacoits in Bengal used to worship the goddess K\u0101l\u012b for fulfillment of their sinful desires to plunder others\u2019 property, but they never went to a Vi\u1e63\u1e47u temple because they might have been unsuccessful in praying to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore the prayers of the demigods or the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are always untinged by sinful purposes."

With a view to respect the infallibility of Indra\u2019s weapon, Garu\u1e0da, though otherwise invincible, being the Lord\u2019s own mount, dropped one of his wings, which was shattered to pieces by the thunderbolt. The inhabitants of higher planets are so sensible that even in the process of fighting they observe the preliminary rules and regulations of gentleness. In this case, Garu\u1e0da wanted to show respect for Indra; since he knew that Indra\u2019s weapon must destroy something, he offered his wing."

The instance of the quarrel between Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a is a practical example in this matter. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni wanted to display many magical wonders, but when the Sudar\u015bana cakra appeared, Durv\u0101s\u0101 himself was afraid and fled to various planets for his personal protection. The Lord is described here as tri-p\u0101t, which means that He is the enjoyer of three kinds of sacrifices. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord confirms that He is the beneficiary and enjoyer of all sacrifices, penances and austerities. The Lord is the enjoyer of three kinds of yaj\u00f1a. As further described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, there are sacrifices of goods, sacrifices of meditation and sacrifices of philosophical speculation. Those on the paths of j\u00f1\u0101na, yoga and karma all have to come in the end to the Supreme Lord because v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti: the Supreme Lord is the ultimate enjoyer of everything.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all incarnations, and it is confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 that Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, exists simultaneously in His different incarnations and expansions. The demon\u2019s attempt to measure the Supreme Personality of Godhead is significant. The demon wanted to embrace Him with his arms, thinking that with his limited arms he could capture the Absolute by material power. He did not know that God is the greatest of the great and the smallest of the small. No one can capture the Supreme Lord or bring Him under his control. But the demoniac person always attempts to measure the length and breadth of the Supreme Lord. By His inconceivable potency the Lord can become the universal form, as explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and at the same time He can remain within the box of His devotees as their worshipable Deity. There are many devotees who keep a statue of the Lord in a small box and carry it with them everywhere; every morning they worship the Lord in the box. The Supreme Lord, Ke\u015bava, or the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not bound by any measurement of our calculation. He can remain with His devotee in any suitable form, yet He is unapproachable by any amount of demoniac activities."

        "purport": " Although the demon was dead, his bodily luster was unfaded. This is very peculiar because when a man or animal is dead, the body immediately becomes pale, the luster gradually fades, and decomposition takes place. But here, although Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a lay dead, his bodily luster was unfaded because the Lord, the Supreme Spirit, was touching his body. One\u2019s bodily luster remains fresh only as long as the spirit soul is present. Although the demon\u2019s soul had departed his body, the Supreme Spirit touched the body, and therefore his bodily luster did not fade. The individual soul is different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead when he quits his body is certainly very fortunate, and therefore personalities like Brahm\u0101 and the other demigods eulogized the death of the demon."

        "purport": " The process of yoga is very clearly described in this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. It is said here that the ultimate end of the yog\u012bs and mystics who perform meditation is to get rid of this material body. Therefore they meditate in secluded places to attain yogic trance. Yoga has to be performed in a secluded place, not in public or in a demonstration on stage, as nowadays practiced by many so-called yog\u012bs. Real yoga aims at ridding one of the material body. Yoga practice is not intended to keep the body fit and young. Such advertisements of so-called yoga are not approved by any standard method. Particularly mentioned in this verse is the word yam, or \u201cunto whom,\u201d indicating that meditation should be targeted on the Personality of Godhead. Even if one concentrates his mind on the boar form of the Lord, that is also yoga. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one who concentrates his mind constantly in meditation upon the Personality of Godhead in one of His many varieties of forms is the first-class yog\u012b, and he can very easily attain trance simply by meditating upon the form of the Lord. If one is able to continue such meditation on the Lord\u2019s form at the time of one\u2019s death, one is liberated from this mortal body and is transferred to the kingdom of God. This opportunity was given to the demon by the Lord, and therefore Brahm\u0101 and other demigods were astonished. In other words, the perfection of yoga practice can be attained by a demon also if he is simply kicked by the Lord."

        "purport": " The material world consists of three modes \u2014 goodness, passion and ignorance \u2014 but the spiritual world is pure goodness. It is said here that the form of the Lord is pure goodness, which means that it is not material. In the material world there is no pure goodness. In the Bh\u0101gavatam the stage of pure goodness is called sattva\u1e41 vi\u015buddham. Vi\u015buddham means \u201cpure.\u201d In pure goodness there is no contamination by the two inferior qualities, namely passion and ignorance. Therefore the form of the boar in which the Lord appeared is nothing of the material world. There are many other forms of the Lord, but none of them belong to the material qualities. Such forms are nondifferent from the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form, and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the enjoyer of all sacrifices. The sacrifices which are recommended in the Vedas are meant to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In ignorance only, people try to satisfy many other agents, but the real purpose of life is to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. All sacrifices are meant to please the Supreme Lord. The living entities who know this perfectly well are called demigods, godly or almost God. Since the living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, it is his duty to serve the Lord and please Him. The demigods are all attached to the Personality of Godhead, and for their pleasure the demon, who was a source of trouble to the world, was killed. Purified life is meant to please the Lord, and all sacrifices performed in purified life are called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is developed by devotional service, as clearly mentioned here."

Therefore it is to be understood that all 8,400,000 species of bodily forms originate from the Lord, who is always \u0101di, or the beginning. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Arjuna addresses the Lord as \u0101dyam, or the original. Similarly, in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 the Lord is addressed as \u0101di-puru\u1e63am, the original person. Indeed, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8) the Lord Himself declares, matta\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 pravartate: \u201cFrom Me everything proceeds.\u201d In this situation the Lord assumed the shape of a boar to kill the demon Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a and pick up the earth from the Garbha Ocean. Thus He became \u0101di-s\u016bkara, the original boar. In the material world a boar or pig is considered most abominable, but the \u0101di-s\u016bkara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was not treated as an ordinary boar. Even Lord Brahm\u0101 and the other demigods praised the Lord\u2019s form as a boar. This verse confirms the statement in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the Lord appears as He is from His transcendental abode for the sake of killing the miscreants and saving the devotees. By killing the demon Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a He fulfilled His promise to kill the demons and always protect the demigods headed by Brahm\u0101. The statement that the Lord returned to His own abode indicates that He has His own particular transcendental residence. Since He is full of all energies, He is all-pervasive in spite of His residing in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, just as the sun, although situated in a particular place within the universe, is present by its sunshine throughout the universe. Although the Lord has His particular abode in which to reside, He is all-pervasive. The impersonalists accept one aspect of the Lord\u2019s features, the all-pervasive aspect, but they cannot understand His localized situation in His transcendental abode, where He always engages in fully transcendental pastimes. Especially mentioned in this verse is the word akha\u1e47\u1e0ditotsavam. Utsava means \u201cpleasure.\u201d Whenever some function takes place to express happiness, it is called utsava. Utsava, the expression of complete happiness, is always present in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas, the abode of the Lord, who is worshipable even by demigods like Brahm\u0101, to say nothing of other, less important entities such as human beings. The Lord descends from His abode to this world, and therefore He is called avat\u0101ra, which means \u201cone who descends.\u201d Sometimes avat\u0101ra is understood to refer to an incarnation who assumes a material form of flesh and bone, but actually avat\u0101ra refers to one who descends from higher regions. The Lord\u2019s abode is situated far above this material sky, and He descends from that higher position; thus He is called avat\u0101ra."

Thus he accepted as bona fide the system of parampar\u0101, or receiving the transcendental message in disciplic succession. Unless received by this bona fide process of hearing from a spiritual master, the statement of an \u0101c\u0101rya or preceptor cannot be valid. It is also stated here that although the demon Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a was unlimited in prowess, he was just like a doll for the Lord. A child breaks so many dolls without real endeavor. Similarly, although a demon may be very powerful and extraordinary in the eyes of an ordinary man in the material world, to the Lord, killing such a demon is no difficulty. He can kill millions of demons as simply as a child plays with dolls and breaks them."

        "purport": " If anyone wants to derive transcendental pleasure by hearing the pastimes of the Lord, he must hear from the authoritative source, as explained here. Maitreya heard the narration from his bona fide spiritual master, and Vidura also heard from Maitreya. One becomes an authority simply by presenting whatever he has heard from his spiritual master, and one who does not accept a bona fide spiritual master cannot be an authority. This is clearly explained here. If one wants to have transcendental pleasure, he must find a person with authority. It is also stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam that simply by hearing from an authoritative source, with the ear and the heart, one can relish the pastimes of the Lord; otherwise it is not possible. San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, therefore, has especially warned that one should not hear anything about the personality of the Lord from the lips of a nondevotee. Nondevotees are considered to be like serpents; as milk is poisoned by a serpent\u2019s touch, so, although the narration of the pastimes of the Lord is as pure as milk, when administered by serpentlike nondevotees it becomes poisonous. Not only does it have no effect in transcendental pleasure, but it is dangerous also. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has warned that no description of the pastimes of the Lord should be heard from the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da, or impersonalist, school. He has clearly said, m\u0101y\u0101v\u0101di-bh\u0101\u1e63ya \u015bunile haya sarva n\u0101\u015ba: if anyone hears the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs\u2019 interpretation of the pastimes of the Lord, or their interpretation of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam or any other Vedic literature, then he is doomed. Once one is associated with impersonalists, he can never understand the personal feature of the Lord and His transcendental pastimes. S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b was speaking to the sages headed by \u015aaunaka, and therefore he addressed them in this verse as dvija, twice-born. The sages assembled in Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b were all br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but to acquire the qualifications of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is not everything. Merely to be twice-born is not perfection. Perfection is attained when one hears the pastimes and activities of the Lord from a bona fide source."

Therefore anyone with a simple heart of gratefulness must be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and offer devotional service to the Lord. Those who are actually thieves and rogues do not recognize or acknowledge the benedictions offered to them by the Supreme Lord, and they cannot render Him devotional service. Ungrateful persons are those who do not understand how much benefit they are deriving by the arrangement of the Lord. They enjoy the sunshine and moonshine, and they get water free of charge, yet they do not feel grateful, but simply go on enjoying these gifts of the Lord. Therefore, they must be called thieves and rogues."

        "purport": " Since the Personality of Godhead is in the absolute position, there is no difference between His pastimes and His personality. Anyone who hears about the pastimes of the Lord associates with the Lord directly, and one who associates directly with the Lord is certainly freed from all sinful activities, even to the extent of the killing of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, which is considered the most sinful activity in the material world. One should be very eager to hear about the activities of the Lord from the bona fide source, the pure devotee. If one simply gives aural reception to the narration and accepts the glories of the Lord, then he is qualified. The impersonalist philosophers cannot understand the activities of the Lord. They think that all His activities are m\u0101y\u0101; therefore they are called M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs. Since everything to them is m\u0101y\u0101, these narrations are not for them. Some impersonalists are reluctant to hear \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, although many of them are now taking an interest in it just for monetary gain. Actually, however, they have no faith. On the contrary, they describe it in their own way. We should therefore not hear from the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs. We have to hear from S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b or Maitreya, who actually present the narrations as they are, and only then can we relish the pastimes of the Lord; otherwise the effects on the neophyte audience will be poisonous."

        "purport": " Devotees are generally attracted by the narratives of the pastimes of the Lord, and even though they do not prosecute austerities or meditation, this very process of hearing attentively about the pastimes of the Lord will endow them with innumerable benefits, such as wealth, fame, longevity and other desirable aims of life. If one continues to hear \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which is full of narratives of the pastimes of the Lord, at the end of this life, one is sure to be transferred to the eternal, transcendental abode of the Lord. Thus hearers are benefited both ultimately and for as long as they are in the material world. That is the supreme, sublime result of engaging in devotional service. The beginning of devotional service is to spare some time and listen to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from the right source. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also recommended five items of devotional service, namely to serve the devotees of the Lord, to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, to hear \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, to worship the Deity of the Lord and to live in a place of pilgrimage. Just performing these five activities can deliver one from the miserable condition of material life."
