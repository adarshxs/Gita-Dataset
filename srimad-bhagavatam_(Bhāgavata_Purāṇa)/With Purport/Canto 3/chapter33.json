People who are suffering in this material world because they are conditioned by the material energy can easily get freedom from the clutches of matter by understanding the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy enunciated by Lord Kapila. By this system of philosophy, one can immediately become free, even though one is situated in this material world. That stage is called j\u012bvan-mukti. This means that one is liberated even though one stays with his material body. That happened for Devah\u016bti, the mother of Lord Kapila, and she therefore satisfied the Lord by offering her prayers.

There is no one greater than Him or on an equal level with Him, and everything is completely done by His energy, as if by nature. It is understood herein, therefore, that although the modes of material nature are entrusted to different manifestations like Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u015aiva, each of whom is particularly invested with different kinds of power, the Supreme Lord is completely aloof from such activities.

There is no question of Your fulfilling Your will with the help of anyone else besides Yourself. You are, in the end, the Supreme Soul and the supreme controller. Therefore Your will cannot be checked by anyone else.\u201d The Supreme Lord can check others\u2019 plans. As it is said, \u201cMan proposes and God disposes.\u201d But when the Supreme Personality of Godhead proposes, that desire is under no one else\u2019s control. He is absolute. We are ultimately dependent on Him to fulfill our desires, but we cannot say that God\u2019s desires are also dependent. That is His inconceivable power. That which may be inconceivable for ordinary living entities is easily done by Him. And in spite of His being unlimited, He has subjected Himself to being known from the authoritative scriptures like the Vedic literatures. As it is said, \u015babda-m\u016blatv\u0101t: He can be known through the \u015babda-brahma, or Vedic literature."

My dear Lord, You are self-determined and are the Supreme Personality of Godhead for all living entities. For them You created this material manifestation, and although You are one, Your diverse energies can act multifariously. This is inconceivable to us.",
        "purport": " The statement made in this verse by Devah\u016bti that the Absolute Truth has many diverse energies although He personally has nothing to do is confirmed in the Upani\u1e63ads. There is no one greater than Him or on an equal level with Him, and everything is completely done by His energy, as if by nature. It is understood herein, therefore, that although the modes of material nature are entrusted to different manifestations like Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u015aiva, each of whom is particularly invested with different kinds of power, the Supreme Lord is completely aloof from such activities. Devah\u016bti is saying, \u201cAlthough You personally are not doing anything, Your determination is absolute. There is no question of Your fulfilling Your will with the help of anyone else besides Yourself. You are, in the end, the Supreme Soul and the supreme controller. Therefore Your will cannot be checked by anyone else.\u201d The Supreme Lord can check others\u2019 plans. As it is said, \u201cMan proposes and God disposes.\u201d But when the Supreme Personality of Godhead proposes, that desire is under no one else\u2019s control. He is absolute. We are ultimately dependent on Him to fulfill our desires, but we cannot say that God\u2019s desires are also dependent. That is His inconceivable power. That which may be inconceivable for ordinary living entities is easily done by Him. And in spite of His being unlimited, He has subjected Himself to being known from the authoritative scriptures like the Vedic literatures. As it is said, \u015babda-m\u016blatv\u0101t: He can be known through the \u015babda-brahma, or Vedic literature. Why is the creation made? Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead for all living entities, He created this material manifestation for those living entities who want to enjoy or lord it over material nature. As the Supreme Godhead, He arranges to fulfill their various desires. It is confirmed also in the Vedas, eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n: the supreme one supplies the necessities of the many living entities. There is no limit to the demands of the different kinds of living entities, and the supreme one, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, alone maintains them and supplies them by His inconceivable energy."

        "translation": "To say nothing of the spiritual advancement of persons who see the Supreme Person face to face, even a person born in a family of dog-eaters immediately becomes eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices if he once utters the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or chants about Him, hears about His pastimes, offers Him obeisances or even remembers Him.",
        "purport": " Herein the spiritual potency of chanting, hearing or remembering the holy name of the Supreme Lord is greatly stressed. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has discussed the sequence of sinful activities of the conditioned soul, and he has established, in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu, that those who engage in devotional service become freed from the reactions of all sinful activities. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord says that He takes charge of one who surrenders unto Him, and He makes him immune to all reactions to sinful activities. If by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead one becomes so swiftly cleared of all reactions to sinful activities, then what is to be said of those persons who see Him face to face? Another consideration here is that persons who are purified by the process of chanting and hearing become immediately eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. Generally, only a person who is born in a family of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who has been reformed by the ten kinds of purificatory processes and who is learned in Vedic literature is allowed to perform the Vedic sacrifices. But here the word sadya\u1e25, \u201cimmediately,\u201d is used, and \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b also remarks that one can immediately become eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. A person born in a family of the low caste which is accustomed to eat dogs is so positioned due to his past sinful activities, but by chanting or hearing once in pureness, or in an offenseless manner, he is immediately relieved of the sinful reaction. Not only is he relieved of the sinful reaction, but he immediately achieves the result of all purificatory processes. Taking birth in the family of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is certainly due to pious activities in one\u2019s past life. But still a child who is born in a family of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a depends for his further reformation upon initiation into acceptance of a sacred thread and many other reformatory processes. But a person who chants the holy name of the Lord, even if born in a family of ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las, dog-eaters, does not need reformation. Simply by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he immediately becomes purified and becomes as good as the most learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b especially remarks in this connection, anena p\u016bjyatva\u1e41 lak\u1e63yate. Some caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as remark that by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, purification begins. Of course, that depends on the individual process of chanting, but this remark of \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s is completely applicable if one chants the holy name of the Lord without offense, for he immediately becomes more than a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. As \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b says, p\u016bjyatvam: he immediately becomes as respectable as a most learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a and can be allowed to perform Vedic sacrifices. If simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes sanctified instantly, then what can be said of those persons who see the Supreme Lord face to face and who understand the descent of the Lord, as Devah\u016bti understands Kapiladeva. Usually, initiation depends on the bona fide spiritual master, who directs the disciple. If he sees that a disciple has become competent and purified by the process of chanting, he offers the sacred thread to the disciple just so that he will be recognized as one-hundred-percent equal with a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. This is also confirmed in the Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa by \u015ar\u012b San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b: \u201cAs a base metal like bell metal can be changed into gold by a chemical process, any person can similarly be changed into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101-vidh\u0101na, the initiation process.\u201d It is sometimes remarked that by the chanting process one begins to purify himself and can take birth in his next life in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family and then be reformed. But at this present moment, even those who are born in the best br\u0101hma\u1e47a families are not reformed, nor is there any certainty that they are actually born of br\u0101hma\u1e47a fathers. Formerly the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na reformatory system was prevalent, but at the present moment there is no such garbh\u0101dh\u0101na, or seed-giving ceremony. Under these circumstances, no one knows if a man is factually born of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a father. Whether one has acquired the qualification of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a depends on the judgment of the bona fide spiritual master. He bestows upon the disciple the position of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by his own judgment. When one is accepted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in the sacred thread ceremony under the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika system, then he is dvija, twice-born. That is confirmed by San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b: dvijatva\u1e41 j\u0101yate. By the process of initiation by the spiritual master, a person is accepted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in his purified state of chanting the holy name of the Lord. He then makes further progress to become a qualified Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, which means that the brahminical qualification is already acquired."

He was apparently born in a family of Muhammadans, but because he was chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord offenselessly, Lord Caitanya empowered him to become the authority, or \u0101c\u0101rya, of spreading the name. It did not matter that he was born in a family which was not following the Vedic rules and regulations. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and Advaita Prabhu accepted him as an authority because he was offenselessly chanting the name of the Lord.

        "purport": " As it is stated in the previous verse, a person who has once offenselessly chanted the holy name of God becomes immediately eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. One should not be astonished by this statement of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. One should not disbelieve or think, \u201cHow by chanting the holy name of the Lord can one become a holy man to be compared to the most elevated br\u0101hma\u1e47a?\u201d To eradicate such doubts in the minds of unbelievers, this verse affirms that the stage of chanting the holy name of the Lord is not sudden, but that the chanters have already performed all kinds of Vedic rituals and sacrifices. It is not very astounding, for no one in this life can chant the holy name of the Lord unless he has passed all lower stages, such as performing the Vedic ritualistic sacrifices, studying the Vedas and practicing good behavior like that of the \u0100ryans. All this must first have been done. Just as a student in a law class is to be understood to have already graduated from general education, anyone who is engaged in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 must have already passed all lower stages. It is said that those who simply chant the holy name with the tip of the tongue are glorious. One does not even have to chant the holy name and understand the whole procedure, namely the offensive stage, offenseless stage and pure stage; if the holy name is sounded on the tip of the tongue, that is also sufficient. It is said herein that n\u0101ma, a singular number, one name, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or R\u0101ma, is sufficient. It is not that one has to chant all the holy names of the Lord. The holy names of the Lord are innumerable, and one does not have to chant all the names to prove that he has already undergone all the processes of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. If one chants once only, it is to be understood that he has already passed all the examinations, not to speak of those who are chanting always, twenty-four hours a day. It is specifically said here, tubhyam: \u201cunto You only.\u201d One must chant God\u2019s name, not, as the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers say, any name, such as a demigod\u2019s name or the names of God\u2019s energies. Only the holy name of the Supreme Lord will be effective. Anyone who compares the holy name of the Supreme Lord to the names of the demigods is called p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b, or an offender. The holy name has to be chanted to please the Supreme Lord, and not for any sense gratification or professional purpose. If this pure mentality is there, then even though a person is born of a low family, such as a dog-eater\u2019s, he is so glorious that not only has he purified himself, but he is quite competent to deliver others. He is competent to speak on the importance of the transcendental name, just as \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa did. He was apparently born in a family of Muhammadans, but because he was chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord offenselessly, Lord Caitanya empowered him to become the authority, or \u0101c\u0101rya, of spreading the name. It did not matter that he was born in a family which was not following the Vedic rules and regulations. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and Advaita Prabhu accepted him as an authority because he was offenselessly chanting the name of the Lord. Authorities like Advaita Prabhu and Lord Caitanya immediately accepted that he had already performed all kinds of austerities, studied the Vedas and performed all sacrifices. That is automatically understood. There is a hereditary class of br\u0101hma\u1e47as called the sm\u0101rta-br\u0101hma\u1e47as, however, who are of the opinion that even if such persons who are chanting the holy name of the Lord are accepted as purified, they still have to perform the Vedic rites or await their next birth in a family of br\u0101hma\u1e47as so that they can perform the Vedic rituals.

The word juhuvu\u1e25 means that the chanters of the holy name have already performed all kinds of sacrifices. Sasnu\u1e25 means that they have already traveled to all the holy places of pilgrimage and taken part in purificatory activities at those places. They are called \u0101ry\u0101\u1e25 because they have already finished all these requirements, and therefore they must be among the \u0100ryans or those who have qualified themselves to become \u0100ryans. \u0100ryan refers to those who are civilized, whose manners are regulated according to the Vedic rituals. Any devotee who is chanting the holy name of the Lord is the best kind of \u0100ryan. Unless one studies the Vedas, one cannot become an \u0100ryan, but it is automatically understood that the chanters have already studied all the Vedic literature. The specific word used here is an\u016bcu\u1e25, which means that because they have already completed all those recommended acts, they have become qualified to be spiritual masters."

To be chanting the holy name of Your Lordship, they must have bathed at holy places of pilgrimage, studied the Vedas and fulfilled everything required.",
        "purport": " As it is stated in the previous verse, a person who has once offenselessly chanted the holy name of God becomes immediately eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. One should not be astonished by this statement of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. One should not disbelieve or think, \u201cHow by chanting the holy name of the Lord can one become a holy man to be compared to the most elevated br\u0101hma\u1e47a?\u201d To eradicate such doubts in the minds of unbelievers, this verse affirms that the stage of chanting the holy name of the Lord is not sudden, but that the chanters have already performed all kinds of Vedic rituals and sacrifices. It is not very astounding, for no one in this life can chant the holy name of the Lord unless he has passed all lower stages, such as performing the Vedic ritualistic sacrifices, studying the Vedas and practicing good behavior like that of the \u0100ryans. All this must first have been done. Just as a student in a law class is to be understood to have already graduated from general education, anyone who is engaged in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 must have already passed all lower stages. It is said that those who simply chant the holy name with the tip of the tongue are glorious. One does not even have to chant the holy name and understand the whole procedure, namely the offensive stage, offenseless stage and pure stage; if the holy name is sounded on the tip of the tongue, that is also sufficient. It is said herein that n\u0101ma, a singular number, one name, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or R\u0101ma, is sufficient. It is not that one has to chant all the holy names of the Lord. The holy names of the Lord are innumerable, and one does not have to chant all the names to prove that he has already undergone all the processes of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. If one chants once only, it is to be understood that he has already passed all the examinations, not to speak of those who are chanting always, twenty-four hours a day. It is specifically said here, tubhyam: \u201cunto You only.\u201d One must chant God\u2019s name, not, as the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers say, any name, such as a demigod\u2019s name or the names of God\u2019s energies. Only the holy name of the Supreme Lord will be effective. Anyone who compares the holy name of the Supreme Lord to the names of the demigods is called p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b, or an offender. The holy name has to be chanted to please the Supreme Lord, and not for any sense gratification or professional purpose. If this pure mentality is there, then even though a person is born of a low family, such as a dog-eater\u2019s, he is so glorious that not only has he purified himself, but he is quite competent to deliver others. He is competent to speak on the importance of the transcendental name, just as \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa did. He was apparently born in a family of Muhammadans, but because he was chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord offenselessly, Lord Caitanya empowered him to become the authority, or \u0101c\u0101rya, of spreading the name. It did not matter that he was born in a family which was not following the Vedic rules and regulations. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and Advaita Prabhu accepted him as an authority because he was offenselessly chanting the name of the Lord. Authorities like Advaita Prabhu and Lord Caitanya immediately accepted that he had already performed all kinds of austerities, studied the Vedas and performed all sacrifices. That is automatically understood. There is a hereditary class of br\u0101hma\u1e47as called the sm\u0101rta-br\u0101hma\u1e47as, however, who are of the opinion that even if such persons who are chanting the holy name of the Lord are accepted as purified, they still have to perform the Vedic rites or await their next birth in a family of br\u0101hma\u1e47as so that they can perform the Vedic rituals. But actually that is not the case. Such a man does not need to wait for the next birth to become purified. He is at once purified. It is understood that he has already performed all sorts of rites. It is the so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47as who actually have to undergo different kinds of austerities before reaching that point of purification. There are many other Vedic performances which are not described here. All such Vedic rituals have been already performed by the chanters of the holy name. The word juhuvu\u1e25 means that the chanters of the holy name have already performed all kinds of sacrifices. Sasnu\u1e25 means that they have already traveled to all the holy places of pilgrimage and taken part in purificatory activities at those places. They are called \u0101ry\u0101\u1e25 because they have already finished all these requirements, and therefore they must be among the \u0100ryans or those who have qualified themselves to become \u0100ryans. \u0100ryan refers to those who are civilized, whose manners are regulated according to the Vedic rituals. Any devotee who is chanting the holy name of the Lord is the best kind of \u0100ryan. Unless one studies the Vedas, one cannot become an \u0100ryan, but it is automatically understood that the chanters have already studied all the Vedic literature. The specific word used here is an\u016bcu\u1e25, which means that because they have already completed all those recommended acts, they have become qualified to be spiritual masters. The very word g\u1e5b\u1e47anti, which is used in this verse, means to be already established in the perfectional stage of ritualistic performances. If one is seated on the bench of a high court and is giving judgment on cases, it means that he has already passed all legal exams and is better than those who are engaged in the study of law or those expecting to study law in the future. In a similar way, persons who are chanting the holy name are transcendental to those who are factually performing the Vedic rituals and those who expect to be qualified (or, in other words, those who are born in families of br\u0101hma\u1e47as but have not yet undergone the reformatory processes and who therefore expect to study the Vedic rituals and perform the sacrifices in the future). There are many Vedic statements in different places saying that anyone who chants the holy name of the Lord becomes immediately freed from conditional life and that anyone who hears the holy name of the Lord, even though born of a family of dog-eaters, also becomes liberated from the clutches of material entanglement."

It was her intention that the Lord be satisfied. The word pratyak is significant.

Praty\u0101h\u0101ra means to wind up the activities of the senses. The level of realization of the Supreme Lord evidenced by Devah\u016bti is possible when one is able to withdraw the senses from material activities. When one is engaged in devotional service, there is no scope for his senses to be engaged otherwise. In such full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can understand the Supreme Lord as He is."

Therefore this is an example set by the Supreme Personality of Godhead while acting like an ordinary human being so that others might learn from Him. He could, of course, have stayed with His mother, but He indicated that there was no need to stay with the family.

Devah\u016bti was a king\u2019s daughter and almost a king\u2019s wife also. Although Kardama Muni was not a king, by his yogic mystic power he accommodated Devah\u016bti very comfortably in a nice palace with maidservants and all opulence. But since she had learned austerity even in the presence of her husband, there was no difficulty for her to be austere. Still, because her body underwent severe austerity after the departure of her husband and son, she became thin. To be too fat is not very good for spiritually advanced life. Rather, one should reduce because if one becomes fat it is an impediment to progress in spiritual understanding. One should be careful not to eat too much, sleep too much or remain in a comfortable position. Voluntarily accepting some penances and difficulties, one should take less food and less sleep. These are the procedures for practicing any kind of yoga, whether bhakti-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga or ha\u1e6dha-yoga."

Her great husband, Kardama, gave her all protection at all times.",
        "purport": " The ideal husband-and-wife relationship is very nicely described in this statement. Kardama Muni gave Devah\u016bti all sorts of comforts in his duty as a husband, but he was not at all attached to his wife. As soon as his son, Kapiladeva, was grown up, Kardama at once left all family connection. Similarly, Devah\u016bti was the daughter of a great king, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, and was qualified and beautiful, but she was completely dependent on the protection of her husband. According to Manu, women, the fair sex, should not have independence at any stage of life. In childhood a woman must be under the protection of the parents, in youth she must be under the protection of the husband, and in old age she must be under the protection of the grown children. Devah\u016bti demonstrated all these statements of the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 in her life: as a child she was dependent on her father, later she was dependent on her husband, in spite of her opulence, and she was later on dependent on her son, Kapiladeva."

The answer is explained in the next verse. He was not an ordinary son. Her son was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can give up material attachment, therefore, only when one has attachment for the Supreme Person. This is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate.

If one has complete knowledge of the Supreme Lord, then knowledge of the impersonal Brahman is automatically realized.

Therefore if one is situated in knowledge of the Supreme Person, this implies that one is already situated in the concept of the Supersoul and impersonal Brahman. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said, brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101. This means that unless one is freed from the material entanglement and situated in Brahman, there is no question of entering into the understanding of devotional service or engaging in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is engaged in devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is understood to be already realized in the Brahman concept of life because transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead includes knowledge of Brahman. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham: the concept of the Personality of Godhead does not depend on Brahman. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a also confirms that one who has taken shelter of the all-auspicious Supreme Lord is already situated in the understanding of Brahman. In other words, one who is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is already a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Another significant point of this verse is that one has to observe the prescribed rules and regulations. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, yukt\u0101h\u0101ra-vih\u0101rasya. When one engages in devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he still has to eat, sleep, defend and mate because these are necessities of the body. But he performs such activities in a regulated way. He has to eat k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101da. He has to sleep according to regulative principles. The principle is to reduce the duration of sleep and to reduce eating, taking only what is needed to keep the body fit. In short, the goal is spiritual advancement, not sense gratification. Similarly, sex life must be reduced. Sex life is meant only for begetting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious children. Otherwise, there is no necessity for sex life. Nothing is prohibited, but everything is made yukta, regulated, with the higher purpose always in mind. By following all these rules and regulations of living, one becomes purified, and all misconceptions due to ignorance become nil. It is specifically mentioned here that the causes of material entanglement are completely vanquished."

        "purport": " The previous verse states that Devah\u016bti was already conversant with the Absolute Truth. It may be questioned why she was meditating. The explanation is that when one theoretically discusses the Absolute Truth, he becomes situated in the impersonal concept of the Absolute Truth. Similarly, when one seriously discusses the subject matter of the form, qualities, pastimes and entourage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes situated in meditation on Him. If one has complete knowledge of the Supreme Lord, then knowledge of the impersonal Brahman is automatically realized. The Absolute Truth is realized by the knower according to three different angles of vision, namely impersonal Brahman, localized Supersoul and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore if one is situated in knowledge of the Supreme Person, this implies that one is already situated in the concept of the Supersoul and impersonal Brahman. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said, brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101. This means that unless one is freed from the material entanglement and situated in Brahman, there is no question of entering into the understanding of devotional service or engaging in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is engaged in devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is understood to be already realized in the Brahman concept of life because transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead includes knowledge of Brahman. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham: the concept of the Personality of Godhead does not depend on Brahman. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a also confirms that one who has taken shelter of the all-auspicious Supreme Lord is already situated in the understanding of Brahman. In other words, one who is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is already a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Another significant point of this verse is that one has to observe the prescribed rules and regulations. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, yukt\u0101h\u0101ra-vih\u0101rasya. When one engages in devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he still has to eat, sleep, defend and mate because these are necessities of the body. But he performs such activities in a regulated way. He has to eat k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101da. He has to sleep according to regulative principles. The principle is to reduce the duration of sleep and to reduce eating, taking only what is needed to keep the body fit. In short, the goal is spiritual advancement, not sense gratification. Similarly, sex life must be reduced. Sex life is meant only for begetting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious children. Otherwise, there is no necessity for sex life. Nothing is prohibited, but everything is made yukta, regulated, with the higher purpose always in mind. By following all these rules and regulations of living, one becomes purified, and all misconceptions due to ignorance become nil. It is specifically mentioned here that the causes of material entanglement are completely vanquished. The Sanskrit statement anartha-niv\u1e5btti indicates that this body is unwanted. We are spirit soul, and there was never any need of this material body. But because we wanted to enjoy the material body, we have this body, through the material energy, under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As soon as we are reestablished in our original position of servitorship to the Supreme Lord, we begin to forget the necessities of the body, and at last we forget the body."

Devah\u016bti was fully instructed by her son, Kapiladeva, on how to concentrate her mind on the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form in full detail. Following the instructions of her son in the matter of devotional service, she contemplated the form of the Lord within herself with great devotional love. That is the perfection of Brahman realization or the mystic yoga system or devotional service. At the ultimate issue, when one is fully absorbed in thought of the Supreme Lord and meditates on Him constantly, that is the highest perfection. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms that one who is always absorbed in such a way is to be considered the topmost yog\u012b."

        "translation": "Her mind became completely engaged in the Supreme Lord, and she automatically realized the knowledge of the impersonal Brahman.

        "purport": " The previous verse states that Devah\u016bti was already conversant with the Absolute Truth. It may be questioned why she was meditating. The explanation is that when one theoretically discusses the Absolute Truth, he becomes situated in the impersonal concept of the Absolute Truth. Similarly, when one seriously discusses the subject matter of the form, qualities, pastimes and entourage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes situated in meditation on Him. If one has complete knowledge of the Supreme Lord, then knowledge of the impersonal Brahman is automatically realized. The Absolute Truth is realized by the knower according to three different angles of vision, namely impersonal Brahman, localized Supersoul and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore if one is situated in knowledge of the Supreme Person, this implies that one is already situated in the concept of the Supersoul and impersonal Brahman. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said, brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101. This means that unless one is freed from the material entanglement and situated in Brahman, there is no question of entering into the understanding of devotional service or engaging in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is engaged in devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is understood to be already realized in the Brahman concept of life because transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead includes knowledge of Brahman. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham: the concept of the Personality of Godhead does not depend on Brahman. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a also confirms that one who has taken shelter of the all-auspicious Supreme Lord is already situated in the understanding of Brahman. In other words, one who is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is already a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Another significant point of this verse is that one has to observe the prescribed rules and regulations. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, yukt\u0101h\u0101ra-vih\u0101rasya. When one engages in devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he still has to eat, sleep, defend and mate because these are necessities of the body. But he performs such activities in a regulated way. He has to eat k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101da. He has to sleep according to regulative principles. The principle is to reduce the duration of sleep and to reduce eating, taking only what is needed to keep the body fit. In short, the goal is spiritual advancement, not sense gratification. Similarly, sex life must be reduced. Sex life is meant only for begetting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious children. Otherwise, there is no necessity for sex life. Nothing is prohibited, but everything is made yukta, regulated, with the higher purpose always in mind. By following all these rules and regulations of living, one becomes purified, and all misconceptions due to ignorance become nil. It is specifically mentioned here that the causes of material entanglement are completely vanquished. The Sanskrit statement anartha-niv\u1e5btti indicates that this body is unwanted. We are spirit soul, and there was never any need of this material body. But because we wanted to enjoy the material body, we have this body, through the material energy, under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As soon as we are reestablished in our original position of servitorship to the Supreme Lord, we begin to forget the necessities of the body, and at last we forget the body. Sometimes in a dream we get a particular type of body with which to work in the dream. I may dream that I am flying in the sky or that I have gone into the forest or some unknown place. But as soon as I am awake I forget all these bodies. Similarly, when one is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, fully devoted, he forgets all his changes of body. We are always changing bodies, beginning at birth from the womb of our mother. But when we are awakened to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we forget all these bodies. The bodily necessities become secondary, for the primary necessity is the engagement of the soul in real, spiritual life. The activities of devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are the cause of our being situated in transcendence. The words bhagavaty \u0101tma-sa\u1e41\u015braye denote the Personality of Godhead as the Supreme Soul, or the soul of everyone. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, b\u012bja\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m: \u201cI am the seed of all entities.\u201d By taking shelter of the Supreme Being by the process of devotional service, one becomes fully situated in the concept of the Personality of Godhead. As described by Kapila, mad-gu\u1e47a-\u015bruti-m\u0101tre\u1e47a: one who is fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, situated in the Personality of Godhead, is immediately saturated with love of God as soon as he hears about the transcendental qualities of the Lord. Devah\u016bti was fully instructed by her son, Kapiladeva, on how to concentrate her mind on the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form in full detail. Following the instructions of her son in the matter of devotional service, she contemplated the form of the Lord within herself with great devotional love. That is the perfection of Brahman realization or the mystic yoga system or devotional service. At the ultimate issue, when one is fully absorbed in thought of the Supreme Lord and meditates on Him constantly, that is the highest perfection. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms that one who is always absorbed in such a way is to be considered the topmost yog\u012b. The real purpose of all processes of transcendental realization \u2014 j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga or bhakti-yoga \u2014 is to arrive at the point of devotional service. If one endeavors simply to achieve knowledge of the Absolute Truth or the Supersoul but has no devotional service, he labors without gaining the real result. This is compared to beating the husks of wheat after the grains have already been removed. Unless one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be the ultimate goal, it is valueless simply to speculate or perform mystic yoga practice. In the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga system, the seventh stage of perfection is dhy\u0101na. This dhy\u0101na is the third stage in devotional service. There are nine stages of devotional service. The first is hearing, and then comes chanting and then contemplating. By executing devotional service, therefore, one automatically becomes an expert j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b and an expert yog\u012b. In other words, j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga are different preliminary stages of devotional service."

        "purport": " A great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava said that he who has no remembrance of his body is not bound to material existence. As long as we are conscious of our bodily existence, it is to be understood that we are living conditionally, under the three modes of material nature. When one forgets his bodily existence, his conditional, material life is over. This forgetfulness is actually possible when we engage our senses in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. In the conditional state, one engages his senses as a member of a family or as a member of a society or country. But when one forgets all such membership in material circumstances and realizes that he is an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord, that is actual forgetfulness of material existence. This forgetfulness actually occurs when one renders service unto the Lord. A devotee no longer works with the body for sense gratification with family, society, country, humanity and so on. He simply works for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A devotee always merges in transcendental happiness, and therefore he has no experience of material distresses. This transcendental happiness is called eternal bliss. According to the opinion of devotees, constant remembrance of the Supreme Lord is called sam\u0101dhi, or trance. If one is constantly in trance, there is no possibility of his being attacked or even touched by the modes of material nature. As soon as one is freed from the contamination of the three material modes, he no longer has to take birth to transmigrate from one form to another in this material world."

These refer to the gradual process of discovery of the Absolute Truth, mentioned herein as the bhagavantam. The Supreme Personality of Godhead resides in various Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a means to extinguish the pangs of material existence. When one is able to enter into the spiritual kingdom or into spiritual realization, one is automatically freed from material pangs. That is called brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. According to Vedic scripture, nirv\u0101\u1e47a means cessation of the materialistic way of life. \u0100tm\u0101nam means realization of the Supersoul within the heart. Ultimately, the highest perfection is realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is to be understood that Devah\u016bti entered the planet which is called Kapila Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. There are innumerable Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets predominated by the expansions of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. All the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are known by a particular name of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. As we understand from Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam. Ananta means \u201cinnumerable.\u201d The Lord has innumerable expansions of His transcendental form, and according to the different positions of the symbolical representations in His four hands, He is known as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, V\u0101sudeva, etc. There is also a Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet known as Kapila Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, to which Devah\u016bti was promoted to meet Kapila and reside there eternally, enjoying the company of her transcendental son."

        "translation": "The description of the dealings of Kapiladeva and His mother is very confidential, and anyone who hears or reads this narration becomes a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is carried by Garu\u1e0da, and he thereafter enters into the abode of the Supreme Lord to engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.",
        "purport": " The narration of Kapiladeva and His mother, Devah\u016bti, is so perfect and transcendental that even if one only hears or reads this description, he achieves the highest perfectional goal of life, for he engages in the loving service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no doubt that Devah\u016bti, who had the Supreme Lord as her son and who followed the instructions of Kapiladeva so nicely, attained the highest perfection of human life."
