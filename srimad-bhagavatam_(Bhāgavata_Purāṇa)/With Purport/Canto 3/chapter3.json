When the two brothers attacked Ka\u1e41sa on the throne, Their parents feared that now Ka\u1e41sa would finally get the opportunity to kill their sons, whom they had hidden for so long in the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. The parents of the Lord, due to parental affection, felt extreme danger, and they almost fainted. Just to convince them that They had actually killed Ka\u1e41sa, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Baladeva pulled Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s dead body along the ground to encourage them."

Nor can anyone bring a dead body back to life after the soul has already gone to the region of Yamar\u0101ja. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ventured to the planet of Yamaloka and found the dead son of His teacher and brought him back to his father as a reward for the instructions received. The Lord is constitutionally well versed in all the Vedas, and yet to teach by example that everyone must go to learn the Vedas from an authorized teacher and must satisfy the teacher by service and reward, He Himself adopted this system. The Lord offered His services to His teacher, S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni, and the muni, knowing the power of the Lord, asked something which was impossible to be done by anyone else. The teacher asked that his beloved son, who had died, be brought back to him, and the Lord fulfilled the request. The Lord is not, therefore, an ingrate to anyone who renders Him some sort of service. The devotees of the Lord who always engage in His loving service are never to be disappointed in the progressive march of devotional service."

        "purport": " The Lord once went to the heavenly planet to present an earring to Aditi, the mother of the demigods, and His wife Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 also went with Him. There is a special flowering tree called the p\u0101rij\u0101ta, which grows only in the heavenly planets, and Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 wanted this tree. Just to please His wife, like an ordinary husband, the Lord brought back the tree, and this enraged Vajr\u012b, or the controller of the thunderbolt. Indra\u2019s wives inspired him to run after the Lord to fight, and Indra, because he was a henpecked husband and also a fool, listened to them and dared to fight with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He was a fool on this occasion because he forgot that everything belongs to the Lord. There was no fault on the part of the Lord, even though He took away the tree from the heavenly kingdom, but because Indra was henpecked, dominated by his beautiful wives like \u015aac\u012b, he became a fool, just as all persons who are dominated by their wives are generally foolish. Indra thought that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was a henpecked husband who only by the will of His wife Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 took away the property of heaven, and therefore he thought that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could be punished. He forgot that the Lord is the proprietor of everything and cannot be henpecked. The Lord is fully independent, and by His will only He can have hundreds and thousands of wives like Satyabh\u0101m\u0101. He was not, therefore, attached to Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 because she was a beautiful wife, but He was pleased with her devotional service and thus wanted to reciprocate the unalloyed devotion of His devotee."

But what is this? There is still the great strength of the Yadu dynasty, born of Myself, which may be a more unbearable burden.",
        "purport": " It is a wrong theory that due to an increase in population the world becomes overburdened and therefore there are wars and other annihilating processes. The earth is never overburdened. The heaviest mountains and oceans on the face of the earth hold more living entities than there are human beings, and they are not overburdened. If a census were taken of all the living beings on the surface of the earth, certainly it would be found that the number of humans is not even five percent of the total number of living beings. If the birthrate of human beings is increasing, then the birthrate of other living beings is increasing proportionately. The birthrate of lower animals \u2014 beasts, aquatics, birds, etc. \u2014 is far greater than that of human beings. There is an adequate arrangement for food for all the living beings all over the earth by the order of the Supreme Lord, and He can arrange more and more if there is actually a disproportionate increase of living beings. Therefore, there is no question of an increase in population causing a burden. The earth became overburdened due to dharma-gl\u0101ni, or irregular discharge of the Lord\u2019s desire. The Lord appears on the earth to curb the increase in miscreants, and not the increase in population, as is wrongly put forward by the mundane economist. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared, there had been a sufficient increase in miscreants who had violated the desire of the Lord. The material creation is meant for fulfilling the desire of the Lord, and His desire is that the conditioned souls who are unfit to enter into the kingdom of God have a chance to improve their conditions for entering. The entire process of cosmic arrangement is intended just to give a chance to the conditioned souls to enter the kingdom of God, and there is an adequate arrangement for their maintenance by the nature of the Lord. Therefore, although there may be a great increase in population on the surface of the earth, if the people are exactly in line with God consciousness and are not miscreants, such a burden on the earth is a source of pleasure for her. There are two kinds of burdens. There is the burden of the beast and the burden of love. The burden of the beast is unbearable, but the burden of love is a source of pleasure. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b describes the burden of love very practically. He says that the burden of the husband on the young wife, the burden of the child on the lap of the mother, and the burden of wealth on the businessman, although actually burdens from the viewpoint of heaviness, are sources of pleasure, and in the absence of such burdensome objects, one may feel the burden of separation, which is heavier to bear than the actual burden of love. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a referred to the burden of the Yadu dynasty on the earth, He referred to something different than the burden of the beast. The large numbers of family members born of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a counted to some millions and were certainly a great increase in the population of the earth, but because all of them were expansions of the Lord Himself by His transcendental plenary expansions, they were a source of great pleasure for the earth. When the Lord referred to them in connection with the burden on the earth, He had in mind their imminent disappearance from the earth. All the members of the family of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were incarnations of different demigods, and they were to disappear from the surface of the earth along with the Lord. When He referred to the unbearable heaviness on the earth in connection with the Yadu dynasty, He was referring to the burden of their separation. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b confirms this inference."

That so-called fighting would also take place by the will of the Lord; otherwise there would be no cause for their fighting. Just as Arjuna was made to be illusioned by family affection and thus the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken, so the Yadu dynasty was made to be intoxicated by the will of the Lord, and nothing more. The devotees and associates of the Lord are completely surrendered souls. Thus they are transcendental instruments in the hands of the Lord and can be used in any way the Lord desires. The pure devotees also enjoy such pastimes of the Lord because they want to see Him happy. Devotees of the Lord never assert independent individuality; on the contrary, they utilize their individuality in pursuit of the desires of the Lord, and this cooperation of the devotees with the Lord makes a perfect scene of the Lord\u2019s pastimes."

This incident is the direct proof that the body and the living entity, the spiritual spark, are different. When the living entity takes shelter in the womb of a woman through the injection of the semen of a man, there is an emulsification of the man\u2019s and woman\u2019s discharges, and thus a body is formed the size of a pea, gradually developing into a complete body. But if the developing embryo is destroyed in some way or other, the living entity has to take shelter in another body or in the womb of another woman. The particular living entity who was selected to be the descendant of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u016bru, or the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, was not an ordinary living entity, and by the superior will of the Lord he was destined to be the successor to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Therefore, when A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 destroyed the embryo of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, the Lord, by His own internal potency, entered into the womb of Uttar\u0101 by His plenary portion just to give audience to the would-be Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, who was in great danger. By His appearance within the womb, the Lord encouraged the child and gave him complete protection in a new body by His omnipotency. By His power of omnipresence He was present both inside and outside of Uttar\u0101 and other members of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava family."

Attainment of knowledge and detachment, as very elaborately discussed in S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, is the real perfection of life. Knowledge means to know that the mission of the human form of life is to end all the miseries of material existence and that in spite of having to fulfill the bodily necessities in a regulated way, one must be detached from such animal life. Fulfilling the demands of the body is animal life, and fulfilling the mission of the spirit soul is the human mission."

In the present verse it is described that He is the residence of the goddess of fortune. These two things are not at all contradictory. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is detached from the variegatedness of the inferior nature, but He is in eternal, blissful enjoyment of the spiritual nature, or His internal potency. One who has a poor fund of knowledge cannot understand this distinction between the external and internal potencies. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the internal potency is described as the par\u0101 prak\u1e5bti. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a also, the internal potency of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is described as par\u0101 \u015bakti. The Lord is never detached from the association of par\u0101 \u015bakti. This par\u0101 \u015bakti and her manifestations are described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37) as \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibh\u0101vit\u0101bhi\u1e25. The Lord is eternally joyful and cognizant in the taste derived from such transcendental bliss. Negation of the variegatedness of the inferior energy does not necessitate negation of the positive transcendental bliss of the spiritual world. Therefore the Lord\u2019s gentleness, His smile, His character and everything related to Him are all transcendental. Such manifestations of the internal potency are the reality, of which the material shadow is only a temporary representation from which everyone with proper knowledge must be detached."

The same fact is herein corroborated: no one but one who is enlightened by the devotional service of the Lord can understand the difference between the Lord\u2019s activities and those of others, who are controlled by the supernatural force. The sense enjoyment of all animals, men and demigods within the purview of the material universe is controlled by the supernatural force called the prak\u1e5bti, or daiv\u012b-m\u0101y\u0101. No one is independent in obtaining sense enjoyment, and everyone in this material world is after sense enjoyment. Persons who are themselves under the control of supernatural power cannot believe that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not under any control beyond Himself in the matter of sense enjoyment. They cannot understand that His senses are transcendental. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 the Lord\u2019s senses are described as omnipotent; i.e., with any sense He can perform the activities of the other senses. One who has limited senses cannot believe that the Lord can eat by His transcendental power of hearing and can perform the act of sex life simply by seeing. The controlled living entity cannot even dream of such sense activities in his conditional life. But simply by the activities of bhakti-yoga, he can understand that the Lord and His activities are always transcendental. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55), bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25: one cannot know even a fraction of the activities of the Lord if he is not a pure devotee of the Lord."

The mixed devotees are sometimes enthusiastic about fruitive activities and are habituated to philosophical speculation. The pure devotees are free from all these mixtures and are completely absorbed in the service of the Lord, regardless of how and where they are situated. Pure devotees of the Lord are not enthusiastic to put aside their service to the Lord in order to go visit holy places of pilgrimage. A great devotee of the Lord in modern times, \u015ar\u012b Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, has sung like this: \u201cTo visit holy places of pilgrimage is another bewilderment of the mind because devotional service to the Lord at any place is the last word in spiritual perfection.\u201d For pure devotees of the Lord who are completely satisfied with the transcendental loving service of the Lord, there is hardly any necessity to visit the various places of pilgrimage. But those who are not so advanced have the prescribed duties of visiting pilgrimage sites and regularly performing the rituals. The part of the princely order of the Yadu dynasty who went to Prabh\u0101sa performed all duties to be done in a place of pilgrimage and offered their pious actions to their forefathers and others. As a rule, every human being is indebted to God, the demigods, great sages, other living entities, people in general, forefathers, etc., for various contributions received from them. Thus everyone is obliged to repay the debt of gratitude. The Yadus who went to the Prabh\u0101sa pilgrimage site performed their duties by distributing land, gold, and well-nourished cows in royal charity, as described in the following verse."

        "translation": "Thereafter they offered the br\u0101hma\u1e47as highly delicious foodstuffs first offered to the Personality of Godhead and offered their respectful obeisances by touching their heads to the ground. They lived perfectly by protecting the cows and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as.",
        "purport": " The behavior exhibited by the descendants of Yadu in the pilgrimage site of Prabh\u0101sa was highly cultured and exactly to the point of human perfection. The perfection of human life is attained by following three principles of civilization: protecting the cows, maintaining the brahminical culture and, above all, becoming a pure devotee of the Lord. Without becoming a devotee of the Lord, one cannot perfect one\u2019s human life. The perfection of human life is to be elevated to the spiritual world, where there is no birth, no death, no disease and no old age. That is the highest perfectional aim of human life. Without this aim, any amount of material advancement in so-called comforts can only bring the defeat of the human form of life. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas do not accept any foodstuff which is not first offered to the Personality of Godhead. Foodstuff offered to the Lord is accepted by the devotees as the mercy of the Lord. After all, the Lord supplies all kinds of foodstuff, both to the human being and to other animals. A human being must be conscious of the fact that all foodstuffs, namely grains, vegetables, milk, water, etc. \u2014 the prime necessities of life \u2014 are supplied for mankind by the Lord, and such foodstuffs cannot be manufactured by any scientist or materialist in a laboratory or factory established by human effort. The intelligent class of men are called br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and those who have realized the Absolute Truth in His supreme personal feature are called Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. But both of them accept foodstuffs which are the remnants of sacrifice. Sacrifice is ultimately meant to satisfy the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.13) it is said that one who accepts foodstuffs as the remnants of sacrifice is freed from all sinful reactions, and one who cooks foodstuffs for maintenance of his body takes in all kinds of sins, which lead only to suffering. The foodstuffs prepared by the Yadus at the Prabh\u0101sa pilgrimage site to offer to the bona fide br\u0101hma\u1e47as there were all offered to the Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Yadus offered their sincere obeisances by touching their heads to the ground. The Yadus or any enlightened family in Vedic culture are trained for attainment of human perfection by total cooperation of service between the different divisions of social orders. The word uru-rasam is also significant here. Hundreds of delicacies can be prepared simply by the combination of grains, vegetables and milk. All such preparations are in the mode of goodness and therefore may be offered to the Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26), the Lord accepts only foodstuffs which are within the range of fruits, flowers, leaves and liquids, provided they are offered in complete devotional service. Devotional service is the only criterion for a bona fide offering to the Lord. The Lord assures that He positively eats such foodstuffs offered by the devotees. So, judging from all sides, the Yadus were perfectly trained civilized persons, and their being cursed by the br\u0101hma\u1e47a sages was only by the desire of the Lord; the whole incident was a warning to all concerned that no one should behave lightly with br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas."
