        "purport": " In a meeting of learned men, when there are congratulations or addresses for the speaker, the qualifications of the congratulator should be as follows. He must be the leader of the house and an elderly man. He must be vastly learned also. \u015ar\u012b \u015aaunaka \u1e5a\u1e63i had all these qualifications, and thus he stood up to congratulate \u015ar\u012b S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b when he expressed his desire to present \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam exactly as he heard it from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and also realized it personally. Personal realization does not mean that one should, out of vanity, attempt to show one\u2019s own learning by trying to surpass the previous \u0101c\u0101rya. He must have full confidence in the previous \u0101c\u0101rya, and at the same time he must realize the subject matter so nicely that he can present the matter for the particular circumstances in a suitable manner. The original purpose of the text must be maintained. No obscure meaning should be screwed out of it, yet it should be presented in an interesting manner for the understanding of the audience. This is called realization. The leader of the assembly, \u015aaunaka, could estimate the value of the speaker, \u015ar\u012b S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b, simply by his uttering yath\u0101dh\u012btam and yath\u0101-mati, and therefore he was very glad to congratulate him in ecstasy. No learned man should be willing to hear a person who does not represent the original \u0101c\u0101rya. So the speaker and the audience were bona fide in this meeting where Bh\u0101gavatam was being recited for the second time. That should be the standard of recitation of Bh\u0101gavatam, so that real purpose can be served without difficulty. Unless this situation is created, Bh\u0101gavatam recitation for extraneous purposes is useless labor both for the speaker and for the audience."

Such impersonalists twist some meanings out of Bh\u0101gavatam to suit and support impersonalist views, and the professional readers at once go to the Tenth Canto to misexplain the most confidential part of the Lord\u2019s pastimes.

The liberated soul is always engaged in the progressive path of spiritual attainment, which is something like a dream for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul cannot imagine the actual engagements of the liberated soul. While the conditioned soul thus dreams about spiritual engagements, the liberated soul is awake. Similarly, the engagement of a conditioned soul appears to be a dream for the liberated soul. A conditioned soul and a liberated soul may apparently be on the same platform, but factually they are differently engaged, and their attention is always alert, either in sense enjoyment or in self-realization. The conditioned soul is absorbed in matter, whereas the liberated soul is completely indifferent to matter. This indifference is explained as follows."

Thus he did not see a male or female; he saw all living entities in different dress. The ladies who were bathing could understand the mind of a man simply by studying his demeanor, just as by looking at a child one can understand how innocent he is. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was a young boy sixteen years old, and therefore all the parts of his body were developed. He was naked also, and so were the ladies. But because \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was transcendental to sex relations, he appeared very innocent. The ladies, by their special qualifications, could sense this at once, and therefore they were not very concerned about him. But when his father passed, the ladies quickly dressed. The ladies were exactly like his children or grandchildren, yet they reacted to the presence of Vy\u0101sadeva according to the social custom because \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva played the part of a householder. A householder has to distinguish between a male and female; otherwise he cannot be a householder. One should therefore attempt to know the distinction between body and soul without any attachment for male and female. As long as such distinction is there, one should not try to become a sanny\u0101s\u012b like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. At least theoretically one must be convinced that a living entity is neither male nor female. The outward dress is made of matter by material nature to attract the opposite sex and thus keep one entangled in material existence. A liberated soul is above this perverted distinction. He does not distinguish between one living being and another. For him they are all one and the same spirit. The perfection of this spiritual vision is the liberated stage, and \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b attained that stage. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva was also in the transcendental stage, but because he was in the householder\u2019s life, he did not pretend to be a liberated soul, as a matter of custom."

Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was a pious king. He conquered his enemies, and therefore the kingdom was full of prosperity. There was enough milk, grains and metals, and all the rivers and mountains were full of potency. So materially everything was satisfactory. Therefore, there was no question of untimely giving up his kingdom and life. The sages were eager to hear about all this."

        "purport": " Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was an ideal king and householder because he was a devotee of the Personality of Godhead. A devotee of the Lord automatically has all good qualifications. And the Emperor was a typical example of this. Personally he had no attachment for all the worldly opulences in his possession. But since he was king for the all-around welfare of his citizens, he was always busy in the welfare work of the public, not only for this life, but also for the next. He would not allow slaughterhouses or killing of cows. He was not a foolish and partial administrator who would arrange for the protection of one living being and allow another to be killed. Because he was a devotee of the Lord, he knew perfectly well how to conduct his administration for everyone\u2019s happiness \u2014 men, animals, plants and all living creatures. He was not selfishly interested. Selfishness is either self-centered or self-extended. He was neither. His interest was to please the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead. The king is the representative of the Supreme Lord, and therefore the king\u2019s interest must be identical with that of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord wants all living beings to be obedient to Him and thereby become happy. Therefore the king\u2019s interest is to guide all subjects back to the kingdom of God. Hence the activities of the citizens should be so coordinated that they can at the end go back home, back to Godhead. Under the administration of a representative king, the kingdom is full of opulence. At that time, human beings need not eat animals. There are ample food grains, milk, fruit and vegetables so that the human beings as well as the animals can eat sumptuously and to their heart\u2019s content. If all living beings are satisfied with food and shelter and obey the prescribed rules, there cannot be any disturbance between one living being and another. Emperor Par\u012bk\u1e63it was a worthy king, and therefore all were happy during his reign."

The br\u0101hma\u1e47as are meant to administer some fruitive sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas, but the parivr\u0101jak\u0101c\u0101ryas, or learned preachers, are meant to disseminate transcendental knowledge to one and all. As such, the parivr\u0101jak\u0101c\u0101ryas are not always expert in pronouncing the Vedic mantras, which are practiced systematically by accent and meter by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who are meant for administering Vedic rites. Yet it should not be considered that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are more important than the itinerant preachers. They are one and different simultaneously because they are meant for the same end, in different ways. There is no difference also between the Vedic mantras and what is explained in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Itih\u0101sas. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, it is mentioned in the M\u0101dhyandina-\u015bruti that all the Vedas, namely the S\u0101ma, Atharva, \u1e5ag, Yajur, Pur\u0101\u1e47as, Itih\u0101sas, Upani\u1e63ads, etc., are emanations from the breathing of the Supreme Being. The only difference is that the Vedic mantras are mostly begun with pra\u1e47ava o\u1e41k\u0101ra, and it requires some training to practice the metric pronunciation of the Vedic mantras. But that does not mean that \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is of less importance than the Vedic mantras. On the contrary, it is the ripened fruit of all the Vedas, as stated before. Besides that, the most perfectly liberated soul, \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, is absorbed in the studies of the Bh\u0101gavatam, although he is already self-realized. \u015ar\u012bla S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b is following his footsteps, and therefore his position is not the least less important because he was not expert in chanting Vedic mantras with metric pronunciation, which depends more on practice than actual realization. Realization is more important than parrotlike chanting."

Thus he contemplated for the welfare of men in all statuses and orders of life.",
        "purport": " The unmanifested forces of time are so powerful that they reduce all matter to oblivion in due course. In Kali-yuga, the last millennium of a round of four millenniums, the power of all material objects deteriorates by the influence of time. In this age the duration of the material body of the people in general is much reduced, and so is the memory. The action of matter has also not so much incentive. The land does not produce food grains in the same proportions as it did in other ages. The cow does not give as much milk as it used to give formerly. The production of vegetables and fruits is less than before. As such, all living beings, both men and animals, do not have sumptuous, nourishing food. Due to want of so many necessities of life, naturally the duration of life is reduced, the memory is short, intelligence is meager, mutual dealings are full of hypocrisy and so on. The great sage Vy\u0101sadeva could see this by his transcendental vision. As an astrologer can see the future fate of a man, or an astronomer can foretell the solar and lunar eclipses, those liberated souls who can see through the scriptures can foretell the future of all mankind. They can see this due to their sharp vision of spiritual attainment. And all such transcendentalists, who are naturally devotees of the Lord, are always eager to render welfare service to the people in general. They are the real friends of the people in general, not the so-called public leaders who are unable to see what is going to happen five minutes ahead. In this age the people in general as well as their so-called leaders are all unlucky fellows, faithless in spiritual knowledge and influenced by the Age of Kali. They are always disturbed by various diseases. For example, in the present age there are so many TB patients and TB hospitals, but formerly this was not so because the time was not so unfavorable. The unfortunate men of this age are always reluctant to give a reception to the transcendentalists who are representatives of \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva and selfless workers always busy in planning something which may help everyone in all statuses and orders of life. The greatest philanthropists are those transcendentalists who represent the mission of Vy\u0101sa, N\u0101rada, Madhva, Caitanya, R\u016bpa, Sarasvat\u012b, etc. They are all one and the same. The personalities may be different, but the aim of the mission is one and the same, namely, to deliver the fallen souls back home, back to Godhead."

But to make them more easily performable, the Veda was divided into four divisions of sacrifice, just to purify the occupational service of the four orders. Above the four Vedas, namely \u1e5ag, Yajur, S\u0101ma, and Atharva, there are the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Sa\u1e41hit\u0101s, etc., which are known as the fifth Veda. \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva and his many disciples were all historical personalities, and they were very kind and sympathetic toward the fallen souls of this Age of Kali. As such, the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata were made from related historical facts which explained the teaching of the four Vedas. There is no point in doubting the authority of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata as parts and parcels of the Vedas. In the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad (7.1.4), the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, generally known as histories, are mentioned as the fifth Veda. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, that is the way of ascertaining the respective values of the revealed scriptures."

        "purport": " The Veda is one, and the reasons for its divisions in many parts are explained herewith. The seed of all knowledge, or the Veda, is not a subject matter which can easily be understood by any ordinary man. There is a stricture that no one should try to learn the Vedas who is not a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a. This stricture has been wrongly interpreted in so many ways. A class of men, who claim brahminical qualification simply by their birthright in the family of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, claim that the study of the Vedas is a monopoly of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a caste only. Another section of the people take this as an injustice to members of other castes, who do not happen to take birth in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. But both of them are misguided. The Vedas are subjects which had to be explained even to Brahm\u0101j\u012b by the Supreme Lord. Therefore the subject matter is understood by persons with exceptional qualities of goodness. Persons who are in the modes of passion and ignorance are unable to understand the subject matter of the Vedas. The ultimate goal of Vedic knowledge is \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. This Personality is very rarely understood by those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance. In the Satya-yuga everyone was situated in the mode of goodness. Gradually the mode of goodness declined during the Tret\u0101 and Dv\u0101para-yugas, and the general mass of people became corrupt. In the present age the mode of goodness is almost nil, and so for the general mass of people, the kindhearted, powerful sage \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva divided the Vedas in various ways so that they may be practically followed by less intelligent persons in the modes of passion and ignorance. It is explained in the next \u015bloka as follows."

        "purport": " The friends of the twice-born families are those who are born in the families of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas, or the spiritually cultured families, but who themselves are not equal to their forefathers. Such descendants are not recognized as such, for want of purificatory achievements. The purificatory activities begin even before the birth of a child, and the seed-giving reformatory process is called garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. One who has not undergone such garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, or spiritual family planning, is not accepted as being of an actual twice-born family. The garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra is followed by other purificatory processes, out of which the sacred thread ceremony is one. This is performed at the time of spiritual initiation. After this particular sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, one is rightly called twice-born. One birth is calculated during the seed-giving sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, and the second birth is calculated at the time of spiritual initiation. One who has been able to undergo such important sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras can be called a bona fide twice-born. If the father and the mother do not undertake the process of spiritual family planning and simply beget children out of passion only, their children are called dvija-bandhus. These dvija-bandhus are certainly not as intelligent as the children of the regular twice-born families. The dvija-bandhus are classified with the \u015b\u016bdras and the woman class, who are by nature less intelligent. The \u015b\u016bdras and the woman class do not have to undergo any sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra save and except the ceremony of marriage. The less intelligent classes of men, namely women, \u015b\u016bdras and unqualified sons of the higher castes, are devoid of necessary qualifications to understand the purpose of the transcendental Vedas. For them the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was prepared. The purpose of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is to administer the purpose of the Vedas, and therefore within this Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the summary Veda of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is placed. The less intelligent are more interested in stories than in philosophy, and therefore the philosophy of the Vedas in the form of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is spoken by the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vy\u0101sadeva and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are both on the transcendental plane, and therefore they collaborated in doing good to the fallen souls of this age. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the essence of all Vedic knowledge. It is the first book of spiritual values, as the Upani\u1e63ads are. The Ved\u0101nta philosophy is the subject matter for study by the spiritual graduates. Only the postgraduate spiritual student can enter into the spiritual or devotional service of the Lord. It is a great science, and the great professor is the Lord Himself in the form of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. And persons who are empowered by Him can initiate others in the transcendental loving service of the Lord."
