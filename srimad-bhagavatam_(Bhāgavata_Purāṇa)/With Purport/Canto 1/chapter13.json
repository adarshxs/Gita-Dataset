        "purport": " Vidura: One of the prominent figures in the history of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. He was conceived by Vy\u0101sadeva in the womb of the maidservant of Ambik\u0101, mother of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. He is the incarnation of Yamar\u0101ja. Being cursed by Ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bka Muni, he was to become a \u015b\u016bdra. The story is narrated as follows: Once upon a time the state police caught some thieves who had concealed themselves in the hermitage of Ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bka Muni. The police constables, as usual, arrested all the thieves and Ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bka Muni along with them. The magistrate specifically punished the muni to death by being pierced with a lance. When he was just to be pierced, the news reached the king, and he at once stopped the act on consideration of his being a great muni. The king personally begged the muni\u2019s pardon for the mistake of his men, and the saint at once went to Yamar\u0101ja, who prescribes the destiny of the living beings. Yamar\u0101ja, being questioned by the muni, replied that the muni in his childhood pierced an ant with a sharpened straw, and for that reason he was put into difficulty. The muni thought it unwise on the part of Yamar\u0101ja that he was punished for his childish innocence, and thus the muni cursed Yamar\u0101ja to become a \u015b\u016bdra, and this \u015b\u016bdra incarnation of Yamar\u0101ja was known as Vidura, the \u015b\u016bdra brother of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. But this \u015b\u016bdra son of the Kuru dynasty was equally treated by Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, along with his other nephews, and in due course Vidura was married with a girl who was also born in the womb of a \u015b\u016bdr\u0101\u1e47\u012b by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Although Vidura did not inherit the property of his father (the brother of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva), still he was given sufficient state property by Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the elder brother of Vidura. Vidura was very much attached to his elder brother, and all along he tried to guide him on the right path. During the fratricidal war of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Vidura repeatedly implored his elder brother to do justice to the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, but Duryodhana did not like such interference by his uncle, and thus he practically insulted Vidura. This resulted in Vidura\u2019s leaving home for pilgrimage and taking instructions from Maitreya."

        "translation": "After asking various questions and becoming established in the transcendental loving service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Vidura retired from putting questions to Maitreya Muni.",
        "purport": " Vidura retired from putting questions before Maitreya Muni when he was convinced by Maitreya \u1e5a\u1e63i that the summum bonum of life is to be finally situated in the transcendental loving service of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is Govinda, or one who satisfies His devotees in all respects. The conditioned soul, the living being in material existence, seeks happiness by employing his senses in the modes of materialism, but that cannot give him satisfaction. He then searches after the Supreme Truth by the empiric philosophic speculative method and intellectual feats. But if he does not find the ultimate goal, he again goes down to material activities and engages himself in various philanthropic and altruistic works, which all fail to give him satisfaction. So neither fruitive activities nor dry philosophical speculation can give one satisfaction because by nature a living being is the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and all the Vedic literatures give him direction towards that ultimate end. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15) confirms this statement. Like Vidura, an inquisitive conditioned soul must approach a bona fide spiritual master like Maitreya and by intelligent inquiries must try to know everything about karma (fruitive activities), j\u00f1\u0101na (philosophical research for the Supreme Truth) and yoga (the linking process of spiritual realization). One who is not seriously inclined to put questions before a spiritual master need not accommodate a show-bottle spiritual master, nor should a person who may be a spiritual master for others pose to be so if he is unable to engage his disciple ultimately in the transcendental loving service of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vidura was successful in approaching such a spiritual master like Maitreya, and he got the ultimate goal of life: bhakti unto Govinda. Thus there was nothing to be known further about spiritual progress."

It so appeared that they had regained their consciousness after a long period.",
        "purport": " G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b: The ideal chaste lady in the history of the world. She was the daughter of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Subala, the King of G\u0101ndh\u0101ra (now Kandahar in Kabul), and in her maiden state she worshiped Lord \u015aiva. Lord \u015aiva is generally worshiped by Hindu maidens to get a good husband. G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b satisfied Lord \u015aiva, and by his benediction to obtain one hundred sons, she was betrothed to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, despite his being blind forever. When G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b came to know that her would-be husband was a blind man, to follow her life companion she decided to become voluntarily blind. So she wrapped up her eyes with many silk linens, and she was married to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra under the guidance of her elder brother \u015aakuni. She was the most beautiful girl of her time, and she was equally qualified by her womanly qualities, which endeared every member of the Kaurava court. But despite all her good qualities, she had the natural frailties of a woman, and she was envious of Kunt\u012b when the latter gave birth to a male child. Both the queens were pregnant, but Kunt\u012b first gave birth to a male child. Thus G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b became angry and gave a blow to her own abdomen. As a result, she gave birth to a lump of flesh only, but since she was a devotee of Vy\u0101sadeva, by the instruction of Vy\u0101sadeva the lump was divided into one hundred parts, and each part gradually developed to become a male child. Thus her ambition to become the mother of one hundred sons was fulfilled, and she began to nourish all the children according to her exalted position. When the intrigue of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was going on, she was not in favor of fighting with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas; rather, she blamed Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, her husband, for such a fratricidal war. She desired that the state be divided into two parts, for the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du and her own. She was very affected when all her sons died in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and she wanted to curse Bh\u012bmasena and Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, but she was checked by Vy\u0101sadeva. Her mourning over the death of Duryodhana and Du\u1e25\u015b\u0101sana before Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was very pitiful, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a pacified her by transcendental messages. She was equally aggrieved on the death of Kar\u1e47a, and she described to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the lamentation of Kar\u1e47a\u2019s wife. She was pacified by \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva when he showed her dead sons, then promoted to the heavenly kingdoms. She died along with her husband in the jungles of the Him\u0101layas near the mouth of the Ganges; she burned in a forest fire. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira performed the death ceremony of his uncle and aunt. P\u1e5bth\u0101: Daughter of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015a\u016brasena and sister of Vasudeva, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s father. Later she was adopted by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kuntibhoja, and hence she is known as Kunt\u012b. She is the incarnation of the success potency of the Personality of Godhead. The heavenly denizens from the upper planets used to visit the palace of King Kuntibhoja, and Kunt\u012b was engaged for their reception. She also served the great mystic sage Durv\u0101s\u0101, and being satisfied by her faithful service, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni gave her a mantra by which it was possible for her to call for any demigod she pleased. As a matter of inquisitiveness, she at once called for the sungod, who desired couplement with her, but she declined. But the sun-god assured her immunity from virgin adulteration, and so she agreed to his proposal. As a result of this couplement, she became pregnant, and Kar\u1e47a was born by her. By the grace of the sun, she again turned into a virgin girl, but being afraid of her parents, she quitted the newly born child, Kar\u1e47a. After that, when she actually selected her own husband, she preferred P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du to be her husband. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du later wanted to retire from family life and adopt the renounced order of life. Kunt\u012b refused to allow her husband to adopt such life, but at last Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du gave her permission to become a mother of sons by calling some other suitable personalities. Kunt\u012b did not accept this proposal at first, but when vivid examples were set by P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du she agreed. Thus by dint of the mantra awarded by Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni she called for Dharmar\u0101ja, and thus Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was born. She called for the demigod V\u0101yu (air), and thus Bh\u012bma was born. She called for Indra, the King of heaven, and thus Arjuna was born. The other two sons, namely Nakula and Sahadeva, were begotten by P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du himself in the womb of M\u0101dr\u012b. Later on, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du died at an early age, for which Kunt\u012b was so aggrieved that she fainted. Two co-wives, namely Kunt\u012b and M\u0101dr\u012b, decided that Kunt\u012b should live for the maintenance of the five minor children, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and M\u0101dr\u012b should accept the sat\u012b rituals by meeting voluntary death along with her husband. This agreement was endorsed by great sages like \u015aata\u015b\u1e5b\u1e45ga and others present on the occasion. Later on, when the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were banished from the kingdom by the intrigues of Duryodhana, Kunt\u012b followed her sons, and she equally faced all sorts of difficulties during those days. During the forest life one demon girl, Hi\u1e0dimb\u0101, wanted Bh\u012bma as her husband. Bh\u012bma refused, but when the girl approached Kunt\u012b and Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, they ordered Bh\u012bma to accept her proposal and give her a son. As a result of this combination, Gha\u1e6dotkaca was born, and he fought very valiantly with his father against the Kauravas. In their forest life they lived with a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family that was in trouble because of one Bak\u0101sura demon, and Kunt\u012b ordered Bh\u012bma to kill the Bak\u0101sura to protect the br\u0101hma\u1e47a family against troubles created by the demon. She advised Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to start for the P\u0101\u00f1c\u0101lade\u015ba. Draupad\u012b was gained in this P\u0101\u00f1c\u0101lade\u015ba by Arjuna, but by order of Kunt\u012b all five of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava brothers became equally the husbands of P\u0101\u00f1c\u0101l\u012b, or Draupad\u012b. She was married with five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas in the presence of Vy\u0101sadeva. Kunt\u012bdev\u012b never forgot her first child, Kar\u1e47a, and after Kar\u1e47a\u2019s death in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra she lamented and admitted before her other sons that Kar\u1e47a was her eldest son prior to her marriage with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. Her prayers for the Lord after the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was going back home, are excellently explained. Later she went to the forest with G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b for severe penance. She used to take meals after each thirty days. She finally sat down in profound meditation and later burned to ashes in a forest fire. Draupad\u012b: The most chaste daughter of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Drupada and partly an incarnation of the goddess \u015aac\u012b, the wife of Indra. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Drupada performed a great sacrifice under the superintendence of the sage Yaja. By his first offering, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna was born, and by the second offering, Draupad\u012b was born. She is therefore the sister of Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna, and she is also named P\u0101\u00f1c\u0101l\u012b. The five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas married her as a common wife, and each of them begot a son in her. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira begot a son named Pratibhit, Bh\u012bmasena begot a son named Sutasoma, Arjuna begot \u015arutak\u012brti, Nakula begot \u015aat\u0101n\u012bka, and Sahadeva begot \u015arutakarm\u0101. She is described as a most beautiful lady, equal to her mother-in-law, Kunt\u012b. During her birth there was an aeromessage that she should be called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101. The same message also declared that she was born to kill many a k\u1e63atriya. By dint of her blessings from \u015aa\u1e45kara, she was awarded five husbands, equally qualified. When she preferred to select her own husband, princes and kings were invited from all the countries of the world. She was married with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas during their exile in the forest, but when they went back home Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Drupada gave them immense wealth as a dowry. She was well received by all the daughters-in-law of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. When she was lost in a gambling game, she was forcibly dragged into the assembly hall, and an attempt was made by Du\u1e25\u015b\u0101sana to see her naked beauty, even though there were elderly persons like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a present. She was a great devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and by her praying, the Lord Himself became an unlimited garment to save her from the insult. A demon of the name Ja\u1e6d\u0101sura kidnapped her, but her second husband, Bh\u012bmasena, killed the demon and saved her. She saved the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas from the curse of Mahar\u1e63i Durv\u0101s\u0101 by the grace of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas lived incognito in the palace of Vir\u0101\u1e6da, K\u012bcaka was attracted by her exquisite beauty, and by arrangement with Bh\u012bma the devil was killed and she was saved. She was very much aggrieved when her five sons were killed by A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101. At the last stage, she accompanied her husband Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and others and fell on the way. The cause of her falling was explained by Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, but when Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira entered the heavenly planet he saw Draupad\u012b gloriously present there as the goddess of fortune in the heavenly planet. Subhadr\u0101: Daughter of Vasudeva and sister of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. She was not only a very dear daughter of Vasudeva, but also a very dear sister to both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Baladeva. The two brothers and sister are represented in the famous Jagann\u0101tha temple of Pur\u012b, and the temple is still visited by thousands of pilgrims daily. This temple is in remembrance of the Lord\u2019s visit at Kuruk\u1e63etra during an occasion of solar eclipse and His subsequent meeting with the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. The meeting of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a during this occasion is a very pathetic story, and Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya, in the ecstasy of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, always pined for Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at Jagann\u0101tha Pur\u012b. While Arjuna was at Dv\u0101rak\u0101, he wanted to have Subhadr\u0101 as his queen, and he expressed his desire to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knew that His elder brother, Lord Baladeva, was arranging her marriage elsewhere, and since He did not dare to go against the arrangement of Baladeva, He advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadr\u0101. So when all of them were on a pleasure trip on the Raivata Hill, Arjuna managed to kidnap Subhadr\u0101 according to the plan of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012b Baladeva was very angry at Arjuna, and He wanted to kill him, but Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a implored His brother to excuse Arjuna. Then Subhadr\u0101 was duly married with Arjuna, and Abhimanyu was born of Subhadr\u0101. At the premature death of Abhimanyu, Subhadr\u0101 was very mortified, but on the birth of Par\u012bk\u1e63it she was happy and solaced."

        "purport": " Due to P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du\u2019s death at an early age, his minor children and widow were the object of special care by all the elderly members of the family, especially Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva and Mah\u0101tm\u0101 Vidura. Vidura was more or less partial to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas due to their political position. Although Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was equally careful for the minor children of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, he was one of the intriguing parties who wanted to wash away the descendants of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du and replace them by raising his own sons to become the rulers of the kingdom. Mah\u0101tm\u0101 Vidura could follow this intrigue of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and company, and therefore, even though he was a faithful servitor of his eldest brother, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, he did not like his political ambition for the sake of his own sons. He was therefore very careful about the protection of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and their widow mother. Thus he was, so to speak, partial to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, preferring them to the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, although both of them were equally affectionate in his ordinary eyes. He was equally affectionate to both the camps of nephews in the sense that he always chastised Duryodhana for his intriguing policy against his cousins. He always criticized his elder brother for his policy of encouragement to his sons, and at the same time he was always alert in giving special protection to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. All these different activities of Vidura within the palace politics made him well known as partial to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira has referred to the past history of Vidura before his going away from home for a prolonged pilgrim\u2019s journey. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira reminded him that he was equally kind and partial to his grown-up nephews, even after the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, a great family disaster. Before the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s policy was peaceful annihilation of his nephews, and therefore he ordered Purocana to build a house of lac at V\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101vata, and when the building was finished Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra desired that his brother\u2019s family live there for some time. When the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were going there in the presence of all the members of the royal family, Vidura tactfully gave instructions to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas about the future plan of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. This is specifically described in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (\u0100di-parva 144). He indirectly hinted, \u201cEven a weapon not made of steel or any other material element can be more than sharp enough to kill an enemy, and he who knows this is never killed.\u201d That is to say, he hinted that the party of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas was being sent to V\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101vata to be killed, and thus he warned Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to be very careful in their new residential palace. He also gave indications of fire and said that fire cannot extinguish the soul but can annihilate the material body. But one who protects the soul can live. Kunt\u012b could not follow such indirect conversations between Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and Vidura, and thus when she inquired from her son about the purport of the conversation, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira replied that from the talks of Vidura it was understood that there was a hint of fire in the house where they were proceeding. Later on, Vidura came in disguise to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and informed them that the housekeeper was going to set fire to the house on the fourteenth night of the waning moon. It was an intrigue of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra that the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas might die all together with their mother. And by his warning the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas escaped through a tunnel underneath the earth so that their escape was also unknown to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, so much so that after setting the fire, the Kauravas were so certain of the death of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas that Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra performed the last rites of death with great cheerfulness. And during the mourning period all the members of the palace became overwhelmed with lamentation, but Vidura did not become so, because of his knowledge that the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were alive somewhere. There are many such instances of calamities, and in each of them Vidura gave protection to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas on one hand, and on the other he tried to restrain his brother Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra from such intriguing policies. Therefore, he was always partial to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, just as a bird protects its eggs by its wing."

        "purport": " Vidura went out from the palace to detach himself from household affairs, especially political intrigues. As referred to hereinbefore, he was practically insulted by Duryodhana\u2019s calling him a son of a \u015b\u016bdr\u0101\u1e47\u012b, although it was not out of place to talk loosely in the case of one\u2019s grandmother. Vidura\u2019s mother, although a \u015b\u016bdr\u0101\u1e47\u012b, was the grandmother of Duryodhana, and funny talks are sometimes allowed between grandmother and grandchildren. But because the remark was an actual fact, it was unpalatable talk to Vidura, and it was accepted as a direct insult. He therefore decided to quit his paternal house and prepare for the renounced order of life. This preparatory stage is called v\u0101naprastha-\u0101\u015brama, or retired life for traveling and visiting the holy places on the surface of the earth. In the holy places of India, like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Hardwar, Jagann\u0101tha Pur\u012b, and Pray\u0101ga, there are many great devotees, and there are still free kitchen houses for persons who desire to advance spiritually. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was inquisitive to learn whether Vidura maintained himself by the mercy of the free kitchen houses (chatras)."

Similarly, the Lord\u2019s omnipresence is perceived and manifested by His unalloyed devotees like Vidura, just as electricity is manifested in an electric bulb. A pure devotee like Vidura always feels the presence of the Lord everywhere. He sees everything in the potency of the Lord and the Lord in everything. The holy places all over the earth are meant for purifying the polluted consciousness of the human being by an atmosphere surcharged with the presence of the Lord\u2019s unalloyed devotees. If anyone visits a holy place, he must search out the pure devotees residing in such holy places, take lessons from them, try to apply such instructions in practical life and thus gradually prepare oneself for the ultimate salvation, going back to Godhead. To go to some holy place of pilgrimage does not mean only to take a bath in the Ganges or Yamun\u0101 or to visit the temples situated in those places. One should also find representatives of Vidura who have no desire in life save and except to serve the Personality of Godhead. The Personality of Godhead is always with such pure devotees because of their unalloyed service, which is without any tinge of fruitive action or utopian speculation. They are in the actual service of the Lord, specifically by the process of hearing and chanting. The pure devotees hear from the authorities and chant, sing and write of the glories of the Lord. Mah\u0101muni Vy\u0101sadeva heard from N\u0101rada, and then he chanted in writing; \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b studied from his father, and he described it to Par\u012bk\u1e63it; that is the way of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. So by their actions the pure devotees of the Lord can render any place into a place of pilgrimage, and the holy places are worth the name only on their account. Such pure devotees are able to rectify the polluted atmosphere of any place, and what to speak of a holy place rendered unholy by the questionable actions of interested persons who try to adopt a professional life at the cost of the reputation of a holy place."

The Y\u0101davas and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were always rapt in the thought of the Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His different transcendental activities, were all pure devotees of the Lord like Vidura. Vidura left home in order to devote himself completely to the service of the Lord, but the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the Y\u0101davas were always rapt in the thought of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus there is no difference in their pure devotional qualities. Either remaining at home or leaving home, the real qualification of a pure devotee is to become rapt in the thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably, i.e., knowing well that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Absolute Personality of Godhead. Ka\u1e41sa, Jar\u0101sandha, \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la and other demons like them were also always rapt in the thought of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but they were absorbed in a different way, namely unfavorably, or thinking Him to be a powerful man only. Therefore, Ka\u1e41sa and \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la are not on the same level as pure devotees like Vidura, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the Y\u0101davas. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was also always rapt in the thought of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His associates at Dv\u0101rak\u0101. Otherwise he could not have asked all about them from Vidura. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was therefore on the same level of devotion as Vidura, although engaged in the state affairs of the kingdom of the world."

        "purport": " Saintly persons like Vidura must be treated as well as a denizen from heaven. In those days denizens of heavenly planets used to visit homes like that of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, and sometimes persons like Arjuna and others used to visit higher planets. N\u0101rada is a spaceman who can travel unrestrictedly, not only within the material universes but also in the spiritual universes. Even N\u0101rada used to visit the palace of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and what to speak of other celestial demigods. It is only the spiritual culture of the people concerned that makes interplanetary travel possible, even in the present body. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira therefore received Vidura in the manner of reception offered to the demigods. Mah\u0101tm\u0101 Vidura had already adopted the renounced order of life, and therefore he did not return to his paternal palace to enjoy some material comforts. He accepted out of his own mercy what was offered to him by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, but the purpose of living in the palace was to deliver his elder brother, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, who was too much materially attached. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra lost all his state and descendants in the fight with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, and still, due to his sense of helplessness, he did not feel ashamed to accept the charity and hospitality of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. On the part of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, it was quite in order to maintain his uncle in a befitting manner, but acceptance of such magnanimous hospitality by Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was not at all desirable. He accepted it because he thought that there was no alternative. Vidura particularly came to enlighten Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and to give him a lift to the higher status of spiritual cognition. It is the duty of enlightened souls to deliver the fallen ones, and Vidura came for that reason. But talks of spiritual enlightenment are so refreshing that while instructing Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, Vidura attracted the attention of all the members of the family, and all of them took pleasure in hearing him patiently. This is the way of spiritual realization. The message should be heard attentively, and if spoken by a realized soul, it will act on the dormant heart of the conditioned soul. And by continuously hearing, one can attain the perfect stage of self-realization."

        "purport": " Vidura, born in the womb of a \u015b\u016bdra woman, was forbidden even to be a party of royal heritage along with his brothers Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. Then how could he occupy the post of a preacher to instruct such learned kings and k\u1e63atriyas as Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira? The first answer is that even though it is accepted that he was a \u015b\u016bdra by birth, because he renounced the world for spiritual enlightenment by the authority of \u1e5a\u1e63i Maitreya and was thoroughly educated by him in transcendental knowledge, he was quite competent to occupy the post of an \u0101c\u0101rya, or spiritual preceptor. According to \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, anyone who is conversant in the transcendental knowledge, or the science of Godhead, be he a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or a \u015b\u016bdra, a householder or a sanny\u0101s\u012b, is eligible to become a spiritual master. Even in the ordinary moral codes (maintained by C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, the great politician and moralist) there is no harm in taking lessons from a person who may be by birth less than a \u015b\u016bdra. This is one part of the answer. The other is that Vidura was not actually a \u015b\u016bdra. He was to play the part of a so-called \u015b\u016bdra for one hundred years, being cursed by Ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bka Muni. He was the incarnation of Yamar\u0101ja, one of the twelve mah\u0101janas, on the level with such exalted personalities as Brahm\u0101, N\u0101rada, \u015aiva, Kapila, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Prahl\u0101da, etc. Being a mah\u0101jana, it is the duty of Yamar\u0101ja to preach the cult of devotion to the people of the world, as N\u0101rada, Brahm\u0101, and other mah\u0101janas do. But Yamar\u0101ja is always busy in his Plutonic kingdom punishing the doers of sinful acts. Yamar\u0101ja is deputed by the Lord to a particular planet, some hundreds of thousands of miles away from the planet of earth, to take away the corrupt souls after death and convict them in accordance with their respective sinful activities. Thus Yamar\u0101ja has very little time to take leave from his responsible office of punishing the wrongdoers. There are more wrongdoers than righteous men. Therefore Yamar\u0101ja has to do more work than other demigods who are also authorized agents of the Supreme Lord. But he wanted to preach the glories of the Lord, and therefore by the will of the Lord he was cursed by Ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bka Muni to come into the world in the incarnation of Vidura and work very hard as a great devotee. Such a devotee is neither a \u015b\u016bdra nor a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. He is transcendental to such divisions of mundane society, just as the Personality of Godhead assumes His incarnation as a hog, but He is neither a hog nor a Brahm\u0101. He is above all mundane creatures. The Lord and His different authorized devotees sometimes have to play the role of many lower creatures to claim the conditioned souls, but both the Lord and His pure devotees are always in the transcendental position. When Yamar\u0101ja thus incarnated himself as Vidura, his post was officiated by Aryam\u0101, one of the many sons of Ka\u015byapa and Aditi. The \u0100dityas are sons of Aditi, and there are twelve \u0100dityas. Aryam\u0101 is one of the twelve \u0100dityas, and therefore it was quite possible for him to take charge of the office of Yamar\u0101ja during his one hundred years\u2019 absence in the form of Vidura. The conclusion is that Vidura was never a \u015b\u016bdra, but was greater than the purest type of br\u0101hma\u1e47a."

Our duration of life is measured, and no one is able to enhance it even by a second against the scheduled time ordained by the supreme will. Such valuable time, especially for the human being, should be cautiously spent because even a second passed away imperceptibly cannot be replaced, even in exchange for thousands of golden coins amassed by hard labor. Every second of human life is meant for making an ultimate solution to the problems of life, i.e., repetition of birth and death and revolving in the cycle of 8,400,000 different species of life. The material body, which is subject to birth and death, diseases and old age, is the cause of all sufferings of the living being, otherwise the living being is eternal; he is never born, nor does he ever die. Foolish persons forget this problem. They do not know at all how to solve the problems of life, but become engrossed in temporary family affairs not knowing that eternal time is passing away imperceptibly and that their measured duration of life is diminishing every second, without any solution to the big problem, namely repetition of birth and death, disease and old age. This is called illusion. But such illusion cannot work on one who is awake in the devotional service of the Lord. Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and his brothers the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were all engaged in the service of the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they had very little attraction for the illusory happiness of this material world. As we have discussed previously, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was fixed in the service of the Lord Mukunda (the Lord, who can award salvation), and therefore he had no attraction even for such comforts of life as are available in the kingdom of heaven, because even the happiness obtained on the planet Brahmaloka is also temporary and illusory. Because the living being is eternal, he can be happy only in the eternal abode of the kingdom of God (paravyoma), from which no one returns to this region of repeated birth and death, disease and old age. Therefore, any comfort of life or any material happiness which does not warrant an eternal life is but illusion for the eternal living being. One who understands this factually is learned, and such a learned person can sacrifice any amount of material happiness to achieve the desired goal known as brahma-sukham, or absolute happiness. Real transcendentalists are hungry for this happiness, and as a hungry man cannot be made happy by all comforts of life minus foodstuff, so the man hungry for eternal absolute happiness cannot be satisfied by any amount of material happiness. Therefore, the instruction described in this verse cannot be applied to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira or his brothers and mother. It was meant for persons like Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, for whom Vidura came especially to impart lessons."

        "purport": " Cruel death cares for none, be he Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra or even Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira; therefore spiritual instruction, as was given to old Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, was equally applicable to younger Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. As a matter of fact, everyone in the royal palace, including the King and his brothers and mother, was raptly attending the lectures. But it was known to Vidura that his instructions were especially meant for Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, who was too materialistic. The word r\u0101jan is especially addressed to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra significantly. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was the eldest son of his father, and therefore according to law he was to be installed on the throne of Hastin\u0101pura. But because he was blind from birth, he was disqualified from his rightful claim. But he could not forget the bereavement, and his disappointment was somewhat compensated after the death of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, his younger brother. His younger brother left behind him some minor children, and Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra became the natural guardian of them, but at heart he wanted to become the factual king and hand the kingdom over to his own sons, headed by Duryodhana. With all these imperial ambitions, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra wanted to become a king, and he contrived all sorts of intrigues in consultation with his brother-in-law \u015aakuni. But everything failed by the will of the Lord, and at the last stage, even after losing everything, men and money, he wanted to remain as king, being the eldest uncle of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, as a matter of duty, maintained Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra in royal honor, and Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was happily passing away his numbered days in the illusion of being a king or the royal uncle of King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Vidura, as a saint and as the duty-bound affectionate youngest brother of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, wanted to awaken Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra from his slumber of disease and old age. Vidura therefore sarcastically addressed Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra as the \u201cKing,\u201d which he was actually not. Everyone is the servant of eternal time, and therefore no one can be king in this material world. King means the person who can order. The celebrated English king wanted to order time and tide, but the time and tide refused to obey his order. Therefore one is a false king in the material world, and Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was particularly reminded of this false position and of the factual fearful happenings which had already approached him at that time. Vidura asked him to get out immediately, if he wanted to be saved from the fearful situation which was approaching him fast. He did not ask Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira in that way because he knew that a king like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira is aware of all the fearful situations of this flimsy world and would take care of himself, in due course, even though Vidura might not be present at that time."

Even in the days of so-called scientific advancement of knowledge, there is no remedial measure either for old age or for death. Old age is the notice of the arrival of death served by cruel time, and no one can refuse to accept either summon calls or the supreme judgment of eternal time. This is explained before Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra because he might ask Vidura to find out some remedial measure for the imminent fearful situation, as he had ordered many times before. Before ordering, however, Vidura informed Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra that there was no remedial measure by anyone or from any source in this material world. And because there is no such thing in the material world, death is identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as it is said by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.34). Death cannot be checked by anyone or from any source within this material world. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu wanted to be immortal and underwent a severe type of penance by which the whole universe trembled, and Brahm\u0101 himself approached him to dissuade Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu from such a severe type of penance. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu asked Brahm\u0101 to award him the blessings of immortality, but Brahm\u0101 said that he himself was subject to death, even in the topmost planet, so how could he award him the benediction of immortality? So there is death even in the topmost planet of this universe, and what to speak of other planets, which are far, far inferior in quality to Brahmaloka, the residing planet of Brahm\u0101. Wherever there is the influence of eternal time, there is this set of tribulations, namely birth, disease, old age and death, and all of them are invincible."

Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no powerful living being within the universe who can overcome the influence of time. Many poets have written verses lamenting the influence of time.

The signs pointed out by Vidura in the body of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra were signs of apak\u1e63aya, or dwindling of the material body before the last stroke of death. The body is born, it develops, stays, creates other bodies, dwindles and then vanishes. But foolish men want to make a permanent settlement of the perishable body and think that their estate, children, society, country, etc., will give them protection. With such foolish ideas, they become overtaken by such temporary engagements and forget altogether that they must give up this temporary body and take a new one, again to arrange for another term of society, friendship and love, again to perish ultimately. They forget their permanent identity and become foolishly active for impermanent occupations, forgetting altogether their prime duty.

        "purport": " A s\u0101dhu should never flatter kings or rich men to live comfortably at their cost. A s\u0101dhu is to speak to the householders about the naked truth of life so that they may come to their senses about the precarious life in material existence. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra is a typical example of an attached old man in household life. He had become a pauper in the true sense, yet he wanted to live comfortably in the house of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, of whom Bh\u012bma especially is mentioned because personally he killed two prominent sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, namely Duryodhana and Du\u1e25\u015b\u0101sana. These two sons were very much dear to him for their notorious and nefarious activities, and Bh\u012bma is particularly pointed out because he killed these two pet sons. Why was Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra living there at the house of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas? Because he wanted to continue his life comfortably, even at the risk of all humiliation. Vidura, therefore, was astonished how powerful is the urge to continue life. This sense of continuing one\u2019s life indicates that a living being is eternally a living entity and does not want to change his bodily habitation. The foolish man does not know that a particular term of bodily existence is awarded to him to undergo a term of imprisonment, and the human body is awarded, after many, many births and deaths, as a chance for self-realization to go back home, back to Godhead. But persons like Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra try to make plans to live there in a comfortable position with profit and interest, for they do not see things as they are. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra is blind and continues to hope to live comfortably in the midst of all kinds of reverses of life. A s\u0101dhu like Vidura is meant to awaken such blind persons and thus help them go back to Godhead, where life is eternal. Once going there, no one wants to come back to this material world of miseries. We can just imagine how responsible a task is entrusted to a s\u0101dhu like Mah\u0101tm\u0101 Vidura."

The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a, or the miserly man, has no estimation of his material body, but the br\u0101hma\u1e47a has a true estimation of himself and the material body. The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a, having a wrong estimation of his material body, wants to enjoy sense gratification with his utmost strength, and even in old age he wants to become a young man by medical treatment or otherwise. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra is addressed herein as a k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a because without any estimation of his material body he wants to live at any cost. Vidura is trying to open his eyes to see that he cannot live more than his term and that he must prepare for death. Since death is inevitable, why should he accept such a humiliating position for living? It is better to take the right path, even at the risk of death. Human life is meant for finishing all kinds of miseries of material existence, and life should be so regulated that one can achieve the desired goal. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, due to his wrong conception of life, had already spoiled eighty percent of his achieved energy, so it behooved him to utilize the remaining days of his miserly life for the ultimate good.

Therefore, one who has spoiled his life without such cultural activities is advised to leave home without knowledge of friends and relatives and, being thus freed from all obligations of family, society, country, etc., give up the body at some unknown destination so that others may not know where and how he has met his death. Dh\u012bra means one who is not disturbed, even when there is sufficient provocation. One cannot give up a comfortable family life due to his affectionate relation with wife and children. Self-realization is obstructed by such undue affection for family, and if anyone is at all able to forget such a relation, he is called undisturbed, or dh\u012bra. This is, however, the path of renunciation based on a frustrated life, but stabilization of such renunciation is possible only by association with bona fide saints and self-realized souls by which one can be engaged in the loving devotional service of the Lord. Sincere surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is possible by awakening the transcendental sense of service. This is made possible by association with pure devotees of the Lord.

The idea is that the renounced order of life, after a frustrated life of sentiment in the material world, may be the stepping stone on the path of self-realization, but real perfection of the path of liberation is attained when one is practiced to depend fully on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who lives in everyone\u2019s heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101. One may live in the darkest jungle alone out of home, but a steadfast devotee knows very well that he is not alone. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is with him, and He can protect His sincere devotee in any awkward circumstance. One should therefore practice devotional service at home, hearing and chanting the holy name, quality, form, pastimes, entourage, etc., in association with pure devotees, and this practice will help one awaken God consciousness in proportion to one\u2019s sincerity of purpose. One who desires material benefit by such devotional activities can never depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although He sits in everyone\u2019s heart. Nor does the Lord give any direction to persons who worship Him for material gain. Such materialistic devotees may be blessed by the Lord with material benefits, but they cannot reach the stage of the first-class human being, as above mentioned.

        "purport": " One can compensate for a life of frustration by becoming a dh\u012bra, or leaving home for good without communicating with relatives, and Vidura advised his eldest brother to adopt this way without delay because very quickly the Age of Kali was approaching. A conditioned soul is already degraded by the material association, and still in the Kali-yuga the good qualities of a man will deteriorate to the lowest standard. He was advised to leave home before Kali-yuga approached because the atmosphere which was created by Vidura, his valuable instructions on the facts of life, would fade away due to the influence of the age which was fast approaching. To become narottama, or a first-class human being depending completely on the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not possible for any ordinary man. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.28) that a person who is completely relieved of all taints of sinful acts can alone depend on the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was advised by Vidura at least to become a dh\u012bra in the beginning if it were impossible for him to become a sanny\u0101s\u012b or a narottama. Persistently endeavoring on the line of self-realization helps a person to rise to the conditions of a narottama from the stage of a dh\u012bra. The dh\u012bra stage is attained after prolonged practice of the yoga system, but by the grace of Vidura one can attain the stage immediately simply by willing to adopt the means of the dh\u012bra stage, which is the preparatory stage for sanny\u0101sa. The sanny\u0101sa stage is the preparatory stage of paramaha\u1e41sa, or the first-grade devotee of the Lord."

Thus he immediately left home to set out on the path of liberation, as directed by his younger brother Vidura.",
        "purport": " Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, the great preacher of the principles of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, has stressed the importance of association with s\u0101dhus, pure devotees of the Lord. He said that even by a moment\u2019s association with a pure devotee, one can achieve all perfection. We are not ashamed to admit that this fact was experienced in our practical life. Were we not favored by His Divine Grace \u015ar\u012bmad Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, by our first meeting for a few minutes only, it would have been impossible for us to accept this mighty task of describing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam in English. Without seeing him at that opportune moment, we could have become a very great business magnate, but never would we have been able to walk the path of liberation and be engaged in the factual service of the Lord under instructions of His Divine Grace. And here is another practical example by the action of Vidura\u2019s association with Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was tightly bound in a network of material affinities related to politics, economy and family attachment, and he did everything in his power to achieve so-called success in his planned projects, but he was frustrated from the beginning to the end so far as his material activities were concerned. And yet, despite his life of failure, he achieved the greatest of all success in self-realization by the forceful instructions of a pure devotee of the Lord, who is the typical emblem of a s\u0101dhu. The scriptures enjoin, therefore, that one should associate with s\u0101dhus only, rejecting all other kinds of association, and by doing so one will have ample opportunity to hear the s\u0101dhus, who can cut to pieces the bonds of illusory affection in the material world. It is a fact that the material world is a great illusion because everything appears to be a tangible reality but at the next moment evaporates like the dashing foam of the sea or a cloud in the sky. A cloud in the sky undoubtedly appears to be a reality because it rains, and due to rains so many temporary green things appear, but in the ultimate issue, everything disappears, namely the cloud, rain and green vegetation, all in due course. But the sky remains, and the varieties of sky or luminaries also remain forever. Similarly, the Absolute Truth, which is compared to the sky, remains eternally, and the temporary cloudlike illusion comes and goes away. Foolish living beings are attracted by the temporary cloud, but intelligent men are more concerned with the eternal sky with all its variegatedness."

        "purport": " Saubalin\u012b, or G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b, daughter of King Subala and wife of King Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, was ideal as a wife devoted to her husband. The Vedic civilization especially prepares chaste and devoted wives, of whom G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b is one amongst many mentioned in history. Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b was also a daughter of a great king, but she followed her husband, Lord R\u0101macandra, into the forest. Similarly, as a woman G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b could have remained at home or at her father\u2019s house, but as a chaste and gentle lady she followed her husband without consideration. Instructions for the renounced order of life were imparted to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra by Vidura, and G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b was by the side of her husband. But he did not ask her to follow him because he was at that time fully determined, like a great warrior who faces all kinds of dangers in the battlefield. He was no longer attracted to so-called wife or relatives, and he decided to start alone, but as a chaste lady G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b decided to follow her husband till the last moment. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra accepted the order of v\u0101naprastha, and at this stage the wife is allowed to remain as a voluntary servitor, but in the sanny\u0101sa stage no wife can stay with her former husband. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is considered to be a dead man civilly, and therefore the wife becomes a civil widow without connection with her former husband. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra did not deny his faithful wife, and she followed her husband at her own risk. The sanny\u0101s\u012bs accept a rod as the sign of the renounced order of life. There are two types of sanny\u0101s\u012bs. Those who follow the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy, headed by \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, accept only one rod (eka-da\u1e47\u1e0da), but those who follow the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avite philosophy accept three combined rods (tri-da\u1e47\u1e0da). The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs are ekada\u1e47\u1e0di-sv\u0101m\u012bs, whereas the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs are known as trida\u1e47\u1e0di-sv\u0101m\u012bs, or more distinctly, trida\u1e47\u1e0di-gosv\u0101m\u012bs, in order to be distinguished from the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers. The ekada\u1e47\u1e0di-sv\u0101m\u012bs are mostly fond of the Him\u0101layas, but the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs are fond of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and Pur\u012b. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs are narottamas, whereas the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs are dh\u012bras. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was advised to follow the dh\u012bras because at that stage it was difficult for him to become a narottama."

The householders are required to rise early in the morning, and after bathing they should offer respects to the Deities at home by prayers, by offering fuel in the sacred fire, by giving the br\u0101hma\u1e47as in charity land, cows, grains, gold, etc., and at last offering to the elderly members due respects and obeisances. One who is not prepared to practice injunctions prescribed in the \u015b\u0101stras cannot be a good man simply by book knowledge. Modern householders are practiced to different modes of life, namely to rise late and then take bed tea without any sort of cleanliness and without any purificatory practices as mentioned above. The household children are taken to practice what the parents practice, and therefore the whole generation glides towards hell. Nothing good can be expected from them unless they associate with s\u0101dhus. Like Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the materialistic person may take lessons from a s\u0101dhu like Vidura and thus be cleansed of the effects of modern life. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, however, could not find in the palace his two uncles, namely Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Vidura, along with G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b, the daughter of King Subala. He was anxious to see them and therefore asked Sa\u00f1jaya, the private secretary of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra."

The fight was executed by the will of the Lord, but the effects of family aggrievement, as they had thought of it before, had come to be true. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was always conscious of the great plight of his uncle Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and aunt G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b, and therefore he took all possible care of them in their old age and aggrieved conditions. When, therefore, he could not find his uncle and aunt in the palace, naturally his doubts arose, and he conjectured that they had gone down to the water of the Ganges. He thought himself ungrateful because when the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were fatherless, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra had given them all royal facilities to live, and in return he had killed all Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s sons in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. As a pious man, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira took into account all his unavoidable misdeeds, and he never thought of the misdeeds of his uncle and company. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra had suffered the effects of his own misdeeds by the will of the Lord, but Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was thinking only of his own unavoidable misdeeds. That is the nature of a good man and devotee of the Lord. A devotee never finds fault with others, but tries to find his own and thus rectify them as far as possible."

        "purport": " That great souls cheat others may be astonishing to know, but it is a fact that great souls cheat others for a great cause. It is said that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also advised Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to tell a lie before Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, and it was also for a great cause. The Lord wanted it, and therefore it was a great cause. Satisfaction of the Lord is the criterion of one who is bona fide, and the highest perfection of life is to satisfy the Lord by one\u2019s occupational duty. That is the verdict of G\u012bt\u0101 and Bh\u0101gavatam.* Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Vidura, followed by G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b, did not disclose their determination to Sa\u00f1jaya, although he was constantly with Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra as his personal assistant. Sa\u00f1jaya never thought that Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra could perform any act without consulting him. But Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s going away from home was so confidential that it could not be disclosed even to Sa\u00f1jaya. San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b also cheated the keeper of the prison house while going away to see \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, and similarly Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b also cheated his priest and left home for good to satisfy the Lord. To satisfy the Lord, anything is good, for it is in relation with the Absolute Truth. We also had the same opportunity to cheat the family members and leave home to engage in the service of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Such cheating was necessary for a great cause, and there is no loss for any party in such transcendental fraud."

Such confidential devotees of the Lord are very much dear to the Lord because they travel everywhere to preach the glories of the Lord in different capacities and try their utmost to convert the nondevotees of the Lord into devotees in order to bring them to the platform of sanity. Actually a living being cannot be a nondevotee of the Lord because of his constitutional position, but when one becomes a nondevotee or nonbeliever, it is to be understood that the person concerned is not in a sound condition of life. The confidential devotees of the Lord treat such illusioned living beings, and therefore they are most pleasing in the eyes of the Lord. The Lord says in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that no one is dearer to Him than one who actually preaches the glories of the Lord to convert the nonbelievers and nondevotees.

Beginning from Brahm\u0101j\u012b, the leader of this universe, down to the insignificant ant, all are abiding by the order of the Supreme Lord. Thus the constitutional position of the living being is subordination under the control of the Lord. The foolish living being, especially man, artificially rebels against the law of the Supreme and thus becomes chastised as an asura, or lawbreaker. A living being is placed in a particular position by the order of the Supreme Lord, and he is again shifted from that place by the order of the Supreme Lord or His authorized agents. Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, Indra, Candra, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira or, in modern history, Napoleon, Akbar, Alexander, Gandhi, Shubhash and Nehru all are servants of the Lord, and they are placed in and removed from their respective positions by the supreme will of the Lord. None of them is independent. Even though such men or leaders rebel so as not to recognize the supremacy of the Lord, they are put under still more rigorous laws of the material world by different miseries. Only the foolish man, therefore, says that there is no God. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was being convinced of this naked truth because he was greatly overwhelmed by the sudden departure of his old uncles and aunt. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was placed in that position according to his past deeds; he had already suffered or enjoyed the benefits accrued to him in the past, but due to his good luck, somehow or other he had a good younger brother, Vidura, and by his instruction he left to achieve salvation by closing all accounts in the material world. Ordinarily one cannot change the course of one\u2019s due happiness and distress by plan. Everyone has to accept them as they come under the subtle arrangement of k\u0101la, or invincible time. There is no use trying to counteract them. The best thing is, therefore, that one should endeavor to achieve salvation, and this prerogative is given only to man because of his developed condition of mental activities and intelligence. Only for man are there different Vedic instructions for attainment of salvation during the human form of existence. One who misuses this opportunity of advanced intelligence is verily condemned and put into different types of miseries, either in this present life or in the future. That is the way the Supreme controls everyone."

        "translation": "As a cow, bound through the nose by a long rope, is conditioned, so also human beings are bound by different Vedic injunctions and are conditioned to obey the orders of the Supreme.",
        "purport": " Every living being, whether a man or an animal or a bird, thinks that he is free by himself, but actually no one is free from the severe laws of the Lord. The laws of the Lord are severe because they cannot be disobeyed in any circumstance. The man-made laws may be evaded by cunning outlaws, but in the codes of the supreme lawmaker there is not the slightest possibility of neglecting the laws. A slight change from the course of God-made law can bring about a massive danger to be faced by the lawbreaker. Such laws of the Supreme are generally known as the codes of religion, under different conditions, but the principle of religion everywhere is one and the same, namely, to obey the orders of the Supreme God, the codes of religion. That is the condition of material existence. All living beings in the material world have taken up the risk of conditioned life by their own selection and are thus entrapped by the laws of material nature. The only way to get out of the entanglement is to agree to obey the Supreme. But instead of becoming free from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, foolish human beings become bound up by different nomenclatures, being designated as br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas, \u015b\u016bdras, Hindus, Mohammedans, Indians, Europeans, Americans, Chinese and many others, and thus they carry out the orders of the Supreme Lord under the influence of respective scriptural or legislative injunctions. The statutory laws of the state are imperfect imitation replicas of religious codes. The secular state, or the godless state, allows the citizens to break the laws of God, but restricts them from disobeying the laws of the state; the result is that the people in general suffer more by breaking the laws of God than by obeying the imperfect laws made by man. Every man is imperfect by constitution under conditions of material existence, and there is not the least possibility that even the most materially advanced man can enact perfect legislation. On the other hand, there is no such imperfection in the laws of God. If leaders are educated in the laws of God, there is no necessity of a makeshift legislative council of aimless men. There is necessity of change in the makeshift laws of man, but there is no change in the God-made laws because they are made perfect by the all-perfect Personality of Godhead. The codes of religion, scriptural injunctions, are made by liberated representatives of God in consideration of different conditions of living, and by carrying out the orders of the Lord, the conditioned living beings gradually become free from the clutches of material existence. The factual position of the living being is, however, that he is the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord. In his liberated state he renders service to the Lord in transcendental love and thus enjoys a life of full freedom, even sometimes on an equal level with the Lord or sometimes more than the Lord. But in the conditioned material world, every living being wants to be the Lord of other living beings, and thus by the illusion of m\u0101y\u0101 this mentality of lording it over becomes a cause of further extension of conditional life. So in the material world the living being is still more conditioned, until he surrenders unto the Lord by reviving his original state of eternal servitorship. That is the last instruction of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and all other recognized scriptures of the world."

        "translation": "As a player sets up and disperses his playthings according to his own sweet will, so the supreme will of the Lord brings men together and separates them.",
        "purport": " We must know for certain that the particular position in which we are now set up is an arrangement of the supreme will in terms of our own acts in the past. The Supreme Lord is present as the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 in the heart of every living being, as it is said in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.23), and therefore he knows everything of our activities in every stage of our lives. He rewards the reactions of our actions by placing us in some particular place. A rich man gets his son born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but the child who came as the rich man\u2019s son deserved such a place, and therefore he is placed there by the will of the Lord. And at a particular moment when the child has to be removed from that place, he is also carried by the will of the Supreme, even if the child or the father does not wish to be separated from the happy relation. The same thing happens in the case of a poor man also. Neither rich man nor poor man has any control over such meetings or separations of living beings. The example of a player and his playthings should not be misunderstood. One may argue that since the Lord is bound to award the reactionary results of our own actions, the example of a player cannot be applied. But it is not so. We must always remember that the Lord is the supreme will, and He is not bound by any law. Generally the law of karma is that one is awarded the result of one\u2019s own actions, but in special cases, by the will of the Lord, such resultant actions are changed also. But this change can be effected by the will of the Lord only, and no other. Therefore, the example of the player cited in this verse is quite appropriate, for the Supreme Will is absolutely free to do whatever He likes, and because He is all-perfect, there is no mistake in any of His actions or reactions. These changes of resultant actions are especially rendered by the Lord when a pure devotee is involved. It is assured in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.30-31) that the Lord saves a pure devotee who has surrendered unto Him without reservation from all sorts of reactions of sins, and there is no doubt about this. There are hundreds of examples of reactions changed by the Lord in the history of the world. If the Lord is able to change the reactions of one\u2019s past deeds, then certainly He is not Himself bound by any action or reaction of His own deeds. He is perfect and transcendental to all laws."

        "purport": " The actual fact is that every living being is an individual part and parcel of the Supreme Being, and his constitutional position is subordinate cooperative service. Either in his conditional material existence or in his liberated position of full knowledge and eternity, the living entity is eternally under the control of the Supreme Lord. But those who are not conversant with factual knowledge put forward many speculative propositions about the real position of the living entity. It is admitted, however, by all schools of philosophy that the living being is eternal and that the covering body of the five material elements is perishable and temporary. The eternal living entity transmigrates from one material body to another by the law of karma, and material bodies are perishable by their fundamental structures. Therefore there is nothing to be lamented in the case of the soul\u2019s being transferred into another body, or the material body\u2019s perishing at a certain stage. There are others also who believe in the merging of the spirit soul in the Supreme Spirit when it is uncovered by the material encagement, and there are others also who do not believe in the existence of spirit or soul, but believe in tangible matter. In our daily experience we find so many transformations of matter from one form to another, but we do not lament such changing features. In either of the above cases, the force of divine energy is uncheckable; no one has any hand in it, and thus there is no cause of grief."

        "purport": " The world\u2019s movements for freedom through political, economic, social, and cultural propaganda can do no benefit to anyone, for they are controlled by superior power. A conditioned living being is under the full control of material nature, represented by eternal time and activities under the dictation of different modes of nature. There are three material modes of nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. Unless one is situated in the mode of goodness, one cannot see things as they are. The passionate and the ignorant cannot even see things as they are. Therefore a person who is passionate and ignorant cannot direct his activities on the right path. Only the man in the quality of goodness can help to a certain extent. Most persons are passionate and ignorant, and therefore their plans and projects can hardly do any good to others. Above the modes of nature is eternal time, which is called k\u0101la because it changes the shape of everything in the material world. Even if we are able to do something temporarily beneficial, time will see that the good project is frustrated in course of time. The only thing possible to be done is to get rid of eternal time, k\u0101la, which is compared to k\u0101la-sarpa, or the cobra snake, whose bite is always lethal. No one can be saved from the bite of a cobra. The best remedy for getting out of the clutches of the cobralike k\u0101la or its integrity, the modes of nature, is bhakti-yoga, as it is recommended in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26). The highest perfectional project of philanthropic activities is to engage everyone in the act of preaching bhakti-yoga all over the world because that alone can save the people from the control of m\u0101y\u0101, or the material nature represented by k\u0101la, karma and gu\u1e47a, as described above. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26) confirms this definitely."

        "translation": "Those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands; those devoid of legs are prey for the four-legged. The weak are the subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is food for another.",
        "purport": " A systematic law of subsistence in the struggle for existence is there by the supreme will, and there is no escape for anyone by any amount of planning. The living beings who have come to the material world against the will of the Supreme Being are under the control of a supreme power called m\u0101y\u0101-\u015bakti, the deputed agent of the Lord, and this daiv\u012b m\u0101y\u0101 is meant to pinch the conditioned souls by threefold miseries, one of which is explained here in this verse: the weak are the subsistence of the strong. No one is strong enough to protect himself from the onslaught of a stronger, and by the will of the Lord there are systematic categories of the weak, the stronger and the strongest. There is nothing to be lamented if a tiger eats a weaker animal, including a man, because that is the law of the Supreme Lord. But although the law states that a human being must subsist on another living being, there is the law of good sense also, for the human being is meant to obey the laws of the scriptures. This is impossible for other animals. The human being is meant for self-realization, and for that purpose he is not to eat anything which is not first offered to the Lord. The Lord accepts from His devotee all kinds of food preparations made of vegetables, fruits, leaves and grains. Fruits, leaves and milk in different varieties can be offered to the Lord, and after the Lord accepts the foodstuff, the devotee can partake of the pras\u0101da, by which all suffering in the struggle for existence will be gradually mitigated. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26). Even those who are accustomed to eat animals can offer foodstuff, not to the Lord directly, but to an agent of the Lord, under certain conditions of religious rites. Injunctions of the scriptures are meant not to encourage the eaters of animals, but to restrict them by regulative principles. The living being is the source of subsistence for other, stronger living beings. No one should be very anxious for his subsistence in any circumstances because there are living beings everywhere, and no living being starves for want of food at any place. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira is advised by N\u0101rada not to worry about his uncles\u2019 suffering for want of food, for they could live on vegetables available in the jungles as pras\u0101da of the Supreme Lord and thus realize the path of salvation. Exploitation of the weaker living being by the stronger is the natural law of existence; there is always an attempt to devour the weak in different kingdoms of living beings. There is no possibility of checking this tendency by any artificial means under material conditions; it can be checked only by awakening the spiritual sense of the human being by practice of spiritual regulations. The spiritual regulative principles, however, do not allow a man to slaughter weaker animals on one side and teach others peaceful coexistence. If man does not allow the animals peaceful coexistence, how can he expect peaceful existence in human society? The blind leaders must therefore understand the Supreme Being and then try to implement the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God, or R\u0101ma-r\u0101jya, is impossible without the awakening of God consciousness in the mass mind of the people of the world."

        "purport": " The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is one without a second, but He manifests Himself by different energies because He is by nature blissful. The living beings are also manifestations of His marginal energy, qualitatively one with the Lord, and there are innumerable living beings both within and without the external and internal energies of the Lord. Since the spiritual world is a manifestation of the Lord\u2019s internal energy, the living beings within that internal potency are qualitatively one with the Lord without contamination from the external potency. Although qualitatively one with the Lord, the living being, due to contamination of the material world, is pervertedly manifested, and therefore he experiences so-called happiness and distress in the material world. Such experiences are all ephemeral and do not affect the spirit soul. The perception of such ephemeral happiness and distress is due only to the forgetfulness of his qualities, which are equal to the Lord\u2019s. There is, however, a regular current from the Lord Himself, from within and without, by which to rectify the fallen condition of the living being. From within He corrects the desiring living beings as localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, and from without He corrects by His manifestations, the spiritual master and the revealed scriptures. One should look unto the Lord; one should not be disturbed by the so-called manifestations of happiness or distress, but he should try to cooperate with the Lord in His outward activities for correcting the fallen souls. By His order only, one should become a spiritual master and cooperate with the Lord. One should not become a spiritual master for one\u2019s personal benefit, for some material gain or as an avenue of business or occupation for earning livelihood. Bona fide spiritual masters who look unto the Supreme Lord to cooperate with Him are actually qualitatively one with the Lord, and the forgetful ones are perverted reflections only. Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is advised by N\u0101rada, therefore, not to be disturbed by the affairs of so-called happiness and distress, but to look only unto the Lord to execute the mission for which the Lord has descended. That was his prime duty."

The predominance of asuras in the world is occasionally rectified by the Lord when He eliminates them from the world and establishes a rule of devat\u0101s like the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas.

As referred to above, the conditioned living beings contact material association by their own choice, dictated by a strong desire to lord it over the resources of the material world and become imitation lords of all they survey. Everyone is trying to become an imitation God; there is keen competition amongst such imitation gods, and such competitors are generally known as asuras. When there are too many asuras in the world, then it becomes a hell for those who are devotees of the Lord. Due to the growth of the asuras, the mass of people who are generally devoted to the Lord by nature and the pure devotees of the Lord, including the demigods in higher planets, pray to the Lord for relief, and the Lord either descends personally from His abode or deputes some of His devotees to remodel the fallen condition of human society, or even animal society. Such disruptions take place not only in human society but also among animals, birds or other living beings, including the demigods in the higher planets. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descended personally to vanquish asuras like Ka\u1e41sa, Jar\u0101sandha and \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la, and during the reign of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira almost all these asuras were killed by the Lord. Now he was awaiting the annihilation of His own dynasty, called the Yadu-va\u1e41\u015ba, who appeared by His will in this world. He wanted to take them away before His own departure to His eternal abode. N\u0101rada, like Vidura, did not disclose the imminent annihilation of the Yadu dynasty, but indirectly gave a hint to the King and his brothers to wait till the incident happened and the Lord departed."

This helps one control the mind and the senses and frees one completely from thoughts of familial affection.",
        "purport": " The yoga system is a mechanical way to control the senses and the mind and divert them from matter to spirit. The preliminary processes are the sitting posture, meditation, spiritual thoughts, manipulation of air passing within the body, and gradual situation in trance, facing the Absolute Person, Param\u0101tm\u0101. Such mechanical ways of rising to the spiritual platform prescribe some regulative principles of taking bath daily three times, fasting as far as possible, sitting and concentrating the mind on spiritual matters and thus gradually becoming free from vi\u1e63aya, or material objectives. Material existence means to be absorbed in the material objective, which is simply illusory. House, country, family, society, children, property and business are some of the material coverings of the spirit, \u0101tm\u0101, and the yoga system helps one to become free from all these illusory thoughts and gradually turn towards the Absolute Person, Param\u0101tm\u0101. By material association and education, we learn simply to concentrate on flimsy things, but yoga is the process of forgetting them altogether. Modern so-called yog\u012bs and yoga systems manifest some magical feats, and ignorant persons are attracted by such false things, or they accept the yoga system as a cheap healing process for diseases of the gross body. But factually the yoga system is the process of learning to forget what we have acquired throughout the struggle for existence. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was all along engaged in improving family affairs by raising the standard of living of his sons or by usurping the property of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas for the sake of his own sons. These are common affairs for a man grossly materialistic and without knowledge of the spiritual force. He does not see how this can drag one from heaven to hell. By the grace of his younger brother Vidura, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was enlightened and could see his grossly illusory engagements, and by such enlightenment he was able to leave home for spiritual realization. \u015ar\u012b N\u0101radadeva was just foretelling the way of his spiritual progress in a place which was sanctified by the flow of the celestial Ganges. Drinking water only, without solid food, is also considered fasting. This is necessary for advancement of spiritual knowledge. A foolish man wants to be a cheap yog\u012b without observing the regulative principles. A man who has no control over the tongue at first can hardly become a yog\u012b. Yog\u012b and bhog\u012b are two opposite terms. The bhog\u012b, or the merry man who eats and drinks, cannot be a yog\u012b, for a yog\u012b is never allowed to eat and drink unrestrictedly. We may note with profit how Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra began his yoga system by drinking water only and sitting calmly in a place with a spiritual atmosphere, deeply absorbed in the thoughts of the Lord Hari, the Personality of Godhead."

Thus all his senses were being engaged in the service of the Lord. This process directly helps the devotee to get freedom from the contaminations of the three material modes of nature. Even the highest mode, the material mode of goodness, is also a cause of material bondage, and what to speak of the other qualities, namely passion and ignorance. Passion and ignorance increase the material propensities of hankering for material enjoyment, and a strong sense of lust provokes the accumulation of wealth and power. One who has conquered these two base mentalities and has raised himself to the platform of goodness, which is full of knowledge and morality, cannot also control the senses, namely the eyes, the tongue, the nose, the ear and touch. But one who has surrendered himself unto the lotus feet of Lord Hari, as above mentioned, can transcend all influences of the modes of material nature and be fixed in the service of the Lord. The bhakti-yoga process, therefore, directly applies the senses to the loving service of the Lord. This prohibits the performer from engaging in material activities. This process of turning the senses from material attachment to the loving transcendental service of the Lord is called praty\u0101h\u0101ra, and the very process is called pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, ultimately ending in sam\u0101dhi, or absorption in pleasing the Supreme Lord Hari by all means."

This covers his pure spiritual identity. By the yogic process, when his pure identity is realized in self-realization, one has to revert to the original position by amalgamating the five gross elements and the subtle elements, mind and intelligence, into the mahat-tattva again. Thus getting freed from the clutches of the mahat-tattva, he has to merge in the existence of the Supersoul. In other words, he has to realize that qualitatively he is nondifferent from the Supersoul, and thus he transcends the material sky by his pure identical intelligence and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. This is the highest perfectional development of spiritual identity, which was attained by Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra by the grace of Vidura and the Lord. The Lord\u2019s mercy was bestowed upon him by his personal contact with Vidura, and when he was actually practicing the instructions of Vidura, the Lord helped him to attain the highest perfectional stage. A pure devotee of the Lord does not live on any planet of the material sky, nor does he feel any contact with material elements. His so-called material body does not exist, being surcharged with the spiritual current of the Lord\u2019s identical interest, and thus he is permanently freed from all contaminations of the sum total of the mahat-tattva. He is always in the spiritual sky, which he attains by being transcendental to the sevenfold material coverings by the effect of his devotional service. The conditioned souls are within the coverings, whereas the liberated soul is far beyond the cover."

The material modes of nature (the gu\u1e47as) have their different modes of activities, but above the material modes of nature is a spiritual mode, which is absolute. Nirgu\u1e47a means without reaction. The spiritual mode and its effect are identical; therefore the spiritual quality is distinguished from its material counterpart by the word nirgu\u1e47a. After complete suspension of the material modes of nature, one is admitted to the spiritual sphere, and action dictated by the spiritual modes is called devotional service, or bhakti.

        "purport": " G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b was an ideal chaste lady, a life companion of her husband, and therefore when she saw her husband burning in the fire of mystic yoga along with his cottage of leaves, she despaired. She left home after losing her one hundred sons, and in the forest she saw that her most beloved husband was also burning. Now she actually felt alone, and therefore she entered the fire of her husband and followed her husband to death. This entering of a chaste lady into the fire of her dead husband is called the sat\u012b rite, and the action is considered to be most perfect for a woman. In a later age, this sat\u012b rite became an obnoxious criminal affair because the ceremony was forced upon even an unwilling woman. In this fallen age it is not possible for any lady to follow the sat\u012b rite as chastely as it was done by G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b and others in past ages. A chaste wife like G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b would feel the separation of her husband to be more burning than actual fire. Such a lady can observe the sat\u012b rite voluntarily, and there is no criminal force by anyone. When the rite became a formality only and force was applied upon a lady to follow the principle, actually it became criminal, and therefore the ceremony was to be stopped by state law. This prophecy of N\u0101rada Muni to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira forbade him to go to his widowed aunt."

Of course it was only due to Vidura that his brother attained the desirable goal of life. Vidura was therefore glad to learn about it. But he was sorry that he could not make his brother turn into a pure devotee. This was not done by Vidura because of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s being inimical to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were all devotees of the Lord. An offense at the feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is more dangerous than an offense at the lotus feet of the Lord. Vidura was certainly very liberal to bestow mercy upon his brother Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, whose past life was very materialistic. But ultimately the result of such mercy certainly depended on the will of the Supreme Lord in the present life; therefore Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra attained liberation only, and after many such liberated states of life one can attain to the stage of devotional service. Vidura was certainly very mortified by the death of his brother and sister-in-law, and the only remedy to mitigate such lamentation was to go out to pilgrimage. Thus Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira had no chance to call back Vidura, his surviving uncle."
