        "purport": " Perfect vision of the Absolute Truth is possible only by the linking process of devotional service. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One can perfectly realize the Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead only by the process of devotional service, and one can enter into the kingdom of God by such perfect knowledge. Imperfect realization of the Absolute by the partial approach of the impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 does not permit anyone to enter into the kingdom of God. \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada advised \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva to become absorbed in transcendental meditation on the Personality of Godhead and His activities. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva did not take notice of the effulgence of Brahman because that is not absolute vision. The absolute vision is the Personality of Godhead, as it is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19): v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti. In the Upani\u1e63ads also it is confirmed that V\u0101sudeva, the Personality of Godhead, is covered by the golden glowing hira\u1e47mayena p\u0101tre\u1e47a veil of impersonal Brahman, and when that curtain is removed by the mercy of the Lord the real face of the Absolute is seen. The Absolute is mentioned here as the puru\u1e63a, or person. The Absolute Personality of Godhead is mentioned in so many Vedic literatures, and in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the puru\u1e63a is confirmed as the eternal and original person. The Absolute Personality of Godhead is the perfect person. The Supreme Person has manifold energies, out of which the internal, external and marginal energies are specifically important. The energy mentioned here is the external energy, as will be clear from the statements of her activities. The internal energy is there along with the Absolute Person as the moonlight is there with the moon. The external energy is compared to darkness because it keeps the living entities in the darkness of ignorance. The word ap\u0101\u015brayam suggests that this energy of the Lord is under full control. The internal potency or superior energy is also called m\u0101y\u0101, but it is spiritual m\u0101y\u0101, or energy exhibited in the absolute realm. When one is under the shelter of this internal potency, the darkness of material ignorance is at once dissipated. And even those who are \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma, or fixed in trance, take shelter of this m\u0101y\u0101, or internal energy. Devotional service, or bhakti-yoga, is the function of the internal energy; thus there is no place for the inferior energy, or material energy, just as there is no place for darkness in the effulgence of spiritual light. Such internal energy is even superior to the spiritual bliss attainable in the conception of impersonal Brahman. It is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the impersonal Brahman effulgence is also an emanation from the Absolute Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The parama-puru\u1e63a cannot be anyone except \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, as will be explained in the later \u015blokas."

        "translation": "Due to this external energy, the living entity, although transcendental to the three modes of material nature, thinks of himself as a material product and thus undergoes the reactions of material miseries.",
        "purport": " The root cause of suffering by the materialistic living beings is pointed out with remedial measures which are to be undertaken and also the ultimate perfection to be gained. All this is mentioned in this particular verse. The living being is by constitution transcendental to material encagement, but he is now imprisoned by the external energy, and therefore he thinks himself one of the material products. And due to this unholy contact, the pure spiritual entity suffers material miseries under the modes of material nature. The living entity misunderstands himself to be a material product. This means that the present perverted way of thinking, feeling and willing, under material conditions, is not natural for him. But he has his normal way of thinking, feeling and willing. The living being in his original state is not without thinking, willing and feeling power. It is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the actual knowledge of the conditioned soul is now covered by nescience. Thus the theory that a living being is absolute impersonal Brahman is refuted herein. This cannot be, because the living entity has his own way of thinking in his original unconditional state also. The present conditional state is due to the influence of the external energy, which means that the illusory energy takes the initiative while the Supreme Lord is aloof. The Lord does not desire that a living being be illusioned by external energy. The external energy is aware of this fact, but still she accepts a thankless task of keeping the forgotten soul under illusion by her bewildering influence. The Lord does not interfere with the task of the illusory energy because such performances of the illusory energy are also necessary for reformation of the conditioned soul. An affectionate father does not like his children to be chastised by another agent, yet he puts his disobedient children under the custody of a severe man just to bring them to order. But the all-affectionate Almighty Father at the same time desires relief for the conditioned soul, relief from the clutches of the illusory energy. The king puts the disobedient citizens within the walls of the jail, but sometimes the king, desiring the prisoners\u2019 relief, personally goes there and pleads for reformation, and on his doing so the prisoners are set free. Similarly, the Supreme Lord descends from His kingdom upon the kingdom of the illusory energy and personally gives relief in the form of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, wherein He personally suggests that although the ways of the illusory energy are very stiff to overcome, one who surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord is set free by the order of the Supreme. This surrendering process is the remedial measure for getting relief from the bewildering ways of the illusory energy. The surrendering process is completed by the influence of association. The Lord has suggested, therefore, that by the influence of the speeches of saintly persons who have actually realized the Supreme, conditioned souls are engaged in His transcendental loving service. They get a taste for hearing about the Lord, and by such hearing only are they gradually elevated to the platform of respect, devotion and attachment for the Lord. The whole thing is completed by the surrendering process. Herein also the same suggestion is made by the Lord in His incarnation of Vy\u0101sadeva. This means that the conditioned souls are being reclaimed by the Lord both ways, namely by the process of punishment by the external energy of the Lord, and by Himself as the spiritual master within and without. Within the heart of every living being the Lord Himself as the Supersoul (Param\u0101tm\u0101) becomes the spiritual master, and from without He becomes the spiritual master in the shape of scriptures, saints and the initiator spiritual master. This is still more explicitly explained in the next \u015bloka. Personal superintendence of the illusory energy is confirmed in the Vedas (the Kena Upani\u1e63ad) in relation to the demigods\u2019 controlling power. Herein also it is clearly stated that the living entity is controlled by the external energy in a personal capacity. The living being thus subject to the control of the external energy is differently situated. It is clear, however, from the present statement of the Bh\u0101gavatam that the same external energy is situated in the inferior position before the Personality of Godhead, or the perfect being. The perfect being, or the Lord, cannot be approached even by the illusory energy, who can only work on the living entities. Therefore it is sheer imagination that the Supreme Lord is illusioned by the illusory energy and thus becomes a living being. If the living being and the Lord were in the same category, then it would have been quite possible for Vy\u0101sadeva to see it, and there would have been no question of material distress on the part of the illusioned being, for the Supreme Being is fully cognizant. So there are so many unscrupulous imaginations on the part of the monists to endeavor to put both the Lord and the living being in the same category. Had the Lord and the living beings been the same, then \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b would not have taken the trouble to describe the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, for they would all be manifestations of the illusory energy. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the summum bonum remedy for suffering humanity in the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva therefore first of all diagnosed the actual disease of the conditioned souls, i.e., their being illusioned by the external energy. He also saw the perfect Supreme Being, from whom the illusory energy is far removed, though He saw both the diseased conditioned souls and also the cause of the disease. And the remedial measures are suggested in the next verse. Both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living beings are undoubtedly qualitatively one, but the Lord is the controller of the illusory energy, whereas the living entity is controlled by the illusory energy. Thus the Lord and the living beings are simultaneously one and different. Another point is distinct herein: that eternal relation between the Lord and the living being is transcendental, otherwise the Lord would not have taken the trouble to reclaim the conditioned souls from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. In the same way, the living entity is also required to revive his natural love and affection for the Lord, and that is the highest perfection of the living entity. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam treats the conditioned soul with an aim to that goal of life."

He also saw His different plenary portions and parts of the plenary portions, namely His different incarnations also, and he specifically observed the unwanted miseries of the conditioned souls, who are bewildered by the external energy. And at last he saw the remedial measure for the conditioned souls, namely the process of devotional service. It is a great transcendental science and begins with the process of hearing and chanting the name, fame, glory, etc., of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Revival of the dormant affection or love of Godhead does not depend on the mechanical system of hearing and chanting, but it solely and wholly depends on the causeless mercy of the Lord. When the Lord is fully satisfied with the sincere efforts of the devotee, He may endow him with His loving transcendental service. But even with the prescribed forms of hearing and chanting, there is at once mitigation of the superfluous and unwanted miseries of material existence. Such mitigation of material affection does not wait for development of transcendental knowledge. Rather, knowledge is dependent on devotional service for the ultimate realization of the Supreme Truth."

        "translation": "Simply by giving aural reception to this Vedic literature, the feeling for loving devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, sprouts up at once to extinguish the fire of lamentation, illusion and fearfulness.",
        "purport": " There are various senses, of which the ear is the most effective. This sense works even when a man is deep asleep. One can protect himself from the hands of an enemy while awake, but while asleep one is protected by the ear only. The importance of hearing is mentioned here in connection with attaining the highest perfection of life, namely getting free from three material pangs. Everyone is full of lamentation at every moment, he is after the mirage of illusory things, and he is always afraid of his supposed enemy. These are the primary symptoms of the material disease. And it is definitely suggested herein that simply by hearing the message of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam one gets attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and as soon as this is effected the symptoms of the material disease disappear. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva saw the all-perfect Personality of Godhead, and in this statement the all-perfect Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is clearly confirmed. The ultimate result of devotional service is to develop genuine love for the Supreme Personality. Love is a word which is often used in relation with man and woman. And love is the only word that can be properly used to indicate the relation between Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the living entities. The living entities are mentioned as prak\u1e5bti in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and in Sanskrit prak\u1e5bti is a feminine object. The Lord is always described as the parama-puru\u1e63a, or the supreme male personality. Thus the affection between the Lord and the living entities is something like that between the male and the female. Therefore the term love of Godhead is quite appropriate. Loving devotional service to the Lord begins with hearing about the Lord. There is no difference between the Lord and the subject matter heard about Him. The Lord is absolute in all respects, and thus there is no difference between Him and the subject matter heard about Him. Therefore, hearing about Him means immediate contact with Him by the process of vibration of the transcendental sound. And the transcendental sound is so effective that it acts at once by removing all material affections mentioned above. As mentioned before, a living entity develops a sort of complexity by material association, and the illusory encagement of the material body is accepted as an actual fact. Under such false complexity, the living beings under different categories of life become illusioned in different ways. Even in the most developed stage of human life, the same illusion prevails in the form of many isms and divides the loving relation with the Lord and thereby divides the loving relation between man and man. By hearing the subject matter of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam this false complexity of materialism is removed, and real peace in society begins, which politicians aspire for so eagerly in so many political situations. The politicians want a peaceful situation between man and man, and nation and nation, but at the same time, because of too much attachment for material domination, there is illusion and fearfulness. Therefore the politicians\u2019 peace conferences cannot bring about peace in society. It can only be done by hearing the subject matter described in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The foolish politicians may go on holding peace and summit conferences for hundreds of years, but they will fail to achieve success. Until we reach the stage of reestablishing our lost relation with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the illusion of accepting the body as the self will prevail, and thus fearfulness will also prevail. As for the validity of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are hundreds and thousands of evidences from revealed scriptures, and there are hundreds and thousands of evidences from personal experiences of devotees in various places like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Navadv\u012bpa and Pur\u012b. Even in the Kaumud\u012b dictionary the synonyms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are given as \u201cthe son of Ya\u015bod\u0101\u201d and \u201cthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Parabrahman.\u201d The conclusion is that simply by hearing the Vedic literature \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, one can have direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thereby one can attain the highest perfection of life by transcending worldly miseries, illusion and fearfulness. These are practical tests for one who has actually given a submissive hearing to the readings of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

This Brahma-s\u016btra, or Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, is meant for those who are already engaged in self-realization. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is so made that one becomes at once engaged in the path of self-realization simply by hearing the topics. Although it is especially meant for the paramaha\u1e41sas, or those who are totally engaged in self-realization, it works into the depths of the hearts of those who may be worldly men. Worldly men are all engaged in sense gratification. But even such men will find in this Vedic literature a remedial measure for their material diseases. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was a liberated soul from the very beginning of his birth, and his father taught him \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Amongst mundane scholars, there is some diversity of opinion as to the date of compilation of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. It is, however, certain from the text of the Bh\u0101gavatam that it was compiled before the disappearance of King Par\u012bk\u1e63it and after the departure of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was ruling the world as the King of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a, he chastised the personality of Kali. According to revealed scriptures and astrological calculation, the Age of Kali is in its five thousandth year. Therefore, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was compiled not less than five thousand years ago. Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was compiled before \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and the Pur\u0101\u1e47as were compiled before Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. That is an estimation of the date of compilation of the different Vedic literatures. The synopsis of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was given before the detailed description under instruction of N\u0101rada. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the science for following the path of niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga. The path of prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga was condemned by N\u0101rada. That path is the natural inclination for all conditioned souls. The theme of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the cure of the materialistic disease of the human being, or stopping completely the pangs of material existence."

This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls.",
        "purport": " Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu explained this \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma \u015bloka very vividly before His chief devotee \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b. He points out eleven factors in the \u015bloka, namely (1) \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma, (2) munaya\u1e25, (3) nirgrantha, (4) api, (5) ca, (6) urukrama, (7) kurvanti, (8) ahaituk\u012bm, (9) bhaktim, (10) ittham-bh\u016bta-gu\u1e47a\u1e25 and (11) hari\u1e25. According to the Vi\u015bva-prak\u0101\u015ba Sanskrit dictionary, there are seven synonyms for the word \u0101tm\u0101, which are as follows: (1) Brahman (the Absolute Truth), (2) body, (3) mind, (4) endeavor, (5) endurance, (6) intelligence and (7) personal habits. The word munaya\u1e25 refers to (1) those who are thoughtful, (2) those who are grave and silent, (3) ascetics, (4) the persistent, (5) mendicants, (6) sages and (7) saints. The word nirgrantha conveys these ideas: (1) one who is liberated from nescience, (2) one who has no connection with scriptural injunction, i.e., who is freed from the obligation of the rules and regulations mentioned in the revealed scriptures like ethics, Vedas, philosophy, psychology and metaphysics (in other words the fools, illiterate, urchins, etc., who have no connection with regulative principles), (3) a capitalist, and also (4) one who is penniless. According to the \u015aabda-ko\u015ba dictionary, the affix ni is used in the sense of (1) certainty, (2) counting, (3) building, and (4) forbiddance, and the word grantha is used in the sense of wealth, thesis, vocabulary, etc. The word urukrama means \u201cthe one whose activities are glorious.\u201d Krama means \u201cstep.\u201d This word urukrama specifically indicates the Lord\u2019s incarnation as V\u0101mana, who covered the whole universe by immeasurable steps. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is powerful, and His activities are so glorious that He has created the spiritual world by His internal potency and the material world by His external potency. By His all-pervading features He is everywhere present as the Supreme Truth, and in His personal feature He is always present in His transcendental abode of Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where He displays His transcendental pastimes in all variegatedness. His activities cannot be compared to anyone else\u2019s, and therefore the word urukrama is just applicable to Him only. According to Sanskrit verbal arrangement, kurvanti refers to doing things for someone else. Therefore, it means that the \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101mas render devotional service unto the Lord not for personal interest but for the pleasure of the Lord, Urukrama. Hetu means \u201ccausal.\u201d There are many causes for one\u2019s sense satisfaction, and they can be chiefly classified as material enjoyment, mystic powers and liberation, which are generally desired by progressive persons. As far as material enjoyments are concerned, they are innumerable, and the materialists are eager to increase them more and more because they are under the illusory energy. There is no end to the list of material enjoyments, nor can anyone in the material universe have all of them. As far as the mystic powers are concerned, they are eight in all (such as to become the minutest in form, to become weightless, to have anything one desires, to lord it over the material nature, to control other living beings, to throw earthly globes in outer space, etc.). These mystic powers are mentioned in the Bh\u0101gavatam. The forms of liberation are five in number. Therefore, unalloyed devotion means service to the Lord without desire for the above-mentioned personal benefits. And the powerful Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can be fully satisfied by such unalloyed devotees free from all sorts of desires for personal benefit. Unalloyed devotional service of the Lord progresses in different stages. Practice of devotional service in the material field is of eighty-one different qualities, and above such activities is the transcendental practice of devotional service, which is one and is called s\u0101dhana-bhakti. When unalloyed practice of s\u0101dhana-bhakti is matured into transcendental love for the Lord, the transcendental loving service of the Lord begins gradually developing into nine progressive stages of loving service under the headings of attachment, love, affection, feelings, affinity, adherence, following, ecstasy, and intense feelings of separation. The attachment of an inactive devotee develops up to the stage of transcendental love of God. Attachment of an active servitor develops up to the stage of adherence, and that for a friendly devotee develops up to the stage of following, and the same is also the case for the parental devotees. Devotees in conjugal love develop ecstasy up to the stage of intense feelings of separation. These are some of the features of unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. According to Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya, the import of the word ittham-bh\u016bta is \u201ccomplete bliss.\u201d Transcendental bliss in the realization of impersonal Brahman becomes comparable to the scanty water contained in the pit made by a cow\u2019s hoof. It is nothing compared with the ocean of bliss of the vision of the Personality of Godhead. The personal form of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so attractive that it comprehends all attraction, all bliss and all tastes (rasas). These attractions are so strong that no one wants to exchange them for material enjoyment, mystic powers and liberation. There is no need of logical arguments in support of this statement, but out of one\u2019s own nature one becomes attracted by the qualities of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We must know for certain that the qualities of the Lord have nothing to do with mundane qualities. All of them are full of bliss, knowledge and eternity. There are innumerable qualities of the Lord, and one is attracted by one quality while another is attracted by another. Great sages, such as the four bachelor-devotees Sanaka, San\u0101tana, Sananda and Sanat-kum\u0101ra, were attracted by the fragrance of flowers and tulas\u012b leaves anointed with the pulp of sandalwood offered at the lotus feet of the Lord. Similarly, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was already situated in the liberated stage, yet he was attracted by the pastimes of the Lord. This proves that the quality of His pastimes has nothing to do with material affinity. Similarly, the young cowherd damsels were attracted by the bodily features of the Lord, and Rukmi\u1e47\u012b was attracted by hearing about the glories of the Lord. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attracts even the mind of the goddess of fortune. He attracts, in special cases, the minds of all young girls. He attracts the minds of the elderly ladies by parental affection. He attracts the minds of the males in the humors of servitude and friendship. The word hari conveys various meanings, but the chief import of the word is that He (the Lord) vanquishes everything inauspicious and takes away the mind of the devotee by awarding pure transcendental love. By remembering the Lord in acute distress one can be free from all varieties of miseries and anxieties. Gradually the Lord vanquishes all obstacles on the path of devotional service of a pure devotee, and the result of nine devotional activities, such as hearing and chanting, becomes manifested. By His personal features and transcendental attributes, the Lord attracts all psychological activities of a pure devotee. Such is the attractive power of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The attraction is so powerful that a pure devotee never hankers for any one of the four principles of religion. These are the attractive features of the transcendental attributes of the Lord. And adding to this the words api and ca, one can increase the imports unlimitedly. According to Sanskrit grammar there are seven synonyms for the word api. So by interpreting each and every word of this \u015bloka, one can see unlimited numbers of transcendental qualities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that attract the mind of a pure devotee."

        "purport": " According to Brahma-vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47a, \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was a liberated soul even within the womb of his mother. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva knew that the child, after his birth, would not stay at home. Therefore he (Vy\u0101sadeva) impressed upon him the synopsis of the Bh\u0101gavatam so that the child could be made attached to the transcendental activities of the Lord. After his birth, the child was still more educated in the subject of the Bh\u0101gavatam by recitation of the actual poems. The idea is that generally the liberated souls are attached to the feature of impersonal Brahman with a monistic view of becoming one with the supreme whole. But by the association of pure devotees like Vy\u0101sadeva, even the liberated soul becomes attracted to the transcendental qualities of the Lord. By the mercy of \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada, \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva was able to narrate the great epic of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and by the mercy of Vy\u0101sadeva, \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was able to grasp the import. The transcendental qualities of the Lord are so attractive that \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b became detached from being completely absorbed in impersonal Brahman and positively took up the personal activity of the Lord. Practically he was thrown from the impersonal conception of the Absolute, thinking within himself that he had simply wasted so much time in devoting himself to the impersonal feature of the Supreme, or in other words, he realized more transcendental bliss with the personal feature than the impersonal. And from that time, not only did he himself become very dear to the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-janas, or the devotees of the Lord, but also the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-janas became very dear to him. The devotees of the Lord, who do not wish to kill the individuality of the living entities and who desire to become personal servitors of the Lord, do not very much like the impersonalists, and similarly the impersonalists, who desire to become one with the Supreme, are unable to evaluate the devotees of the Lord. Thus from time immemorial these two transcendental pilgrims have sometimes been competitors. In other words, each of them likes to keep separate from the other because of the ultimate personal and impersonal realizations. Therefore it appears that \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b also had no liking for the devotees. But since he himself became a saturated devotee, he desired always the transcendental association of the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-janas, and the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-janas also liked his association, since he became a personal Bh\u0101gavata. Thus both the son and the father were completely cognizant of transcendental knowledge in Brahman, and afterwards both of them became absorbed in the personal features of the Supreme Lord. The question as to how \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was attracted by the narration of the Bh\u0101gavatam is thus completely answered by this \u015bloka."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind to the fallen souls that He personally incarnates Himself amongst the different kinds of living entities and takes part with them in daily activities. Any historical fact old or new which has a connection with the activities of the Lord is to be understood as a transcendental narration of the Lord. Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all the supplementary literatures like the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata are simply stories or historical facts. But with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a they become transcendental, and when we hear of them we at once become transcendentally related with the Lord. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is also a Pur\u0101\u1e47a, but the special significance of this Pur\u0101\u1e47a is that the activities of the Lord are central and not just supplementary historical facts. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is thus recommended by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu as the spotless Pur\u0101\u1e47a. There is a class of less intelligent devotees of the Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a who desire to relish at once the activities of the Lord narrated in the Tenth Canto without first understanding the primary cantos. They are under the false impression that the other cantos are not concerned with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus more foolishly than intelligently they take to the reading of the Tenth Canto. These readers are specifically told herein that the other cantos of the Bh\u0101gavatam are as important as the Tenth Canto. No one should try to go into the matters of the Tenth Canto without having thoroughly understood the purport of the other nine cantos. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His pure devotees like the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are on the same plane. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not without His devotees of all the rasas, and the pure devotees like the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are not without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotees and the Lord are interlinked, and they cannot be separated. Therefore talks about them are all k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, or topics of the Lord."

Brahm\u0101j\u012b fled in fear of his life. As far as arka\u1e25 is concerned, there is a reference in the V\u0101mana Pur\u0101\u1e47a. There was a demon by the name Vidyunm\u0101l\u012b who was gifted with a glowing golden airplane which traveled to the back of the sun, and night disappeared because of the glowing effulgence of this plane. Thus the sun-god became angry, and with his virulent rays he melted the plane. This enraged Lord \u015aiva. Lord \u015aiva then attacked the sun-god, who fled away and at last fell down at K\u0101\u015b\u012b (V\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b), and the place became famous as Lol\u0101rka."

The all-pervasive Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plenary portion or expansion. The Lord expands Himself in innumerable forms of Godhead and living beings, along with His different energies. But \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original primeval Lord from whom everything emanates. The all-pervasive feature of the Lord experienced within the manifested world is also a partial representation of the Lord. Param\u0101tm\u0101, therefore, is included within Him. He is the Absolute Personality of Godhead. He has nothing to do with the actions and reactions of the material manifestation because He is far above the material creation. Darkness is a perverse representation of the sun, and therefore the existence of darkness depends on the existence of the sun, but in the sun proper there is no trace of darkness. As the sun is full of light only, similarly the Absolute Personality of Godhead, beyond the material existence, is full of bliss. He is not only full of bliss, but also full of transcendental variegatedness. Transcendence is not at all static, but full of dynamic variegatedness. He is distinct from the material nature, which is complicated by the three modes of material nature. He is parama, or the chief. Therefore He is absolute. He has manifold energies, and through His diverse energies He creates, manifests, maintains and destroys the material world. In His own abode, however, everything is eternal and absolute. The world is not conducted by the energies or powerful agents by themselves, but by the potent all-powerful with all energies."

Subtle material science is not spiritual, but it has a direct relationship with the spiritual method, which is still subtler. A chanter of hymns knew how to apply the weapon as well as how to retract it. That was perfect knowledge. But the son of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, who made use of this subtle science, did not know how to retract.

It is foolish also to think that natural laws are ultimately powerful. Material nature\u2019s law works under the direction of the Lord, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord says there that natural laws work under His supervision. The world can be destroyed only by the will of the Lord and not by the whims of tiny politicians. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desired that the weapons released by both Drau\u1e47i and Arjuna be withdrawn, and it was carried out by Arjuna at once.

The son of a high court judge is not virtually a high court judge, but there is no harm in addressing a high court judge\u2019s son as a relative of the honorable justice. Therefore, as by birth only one does not become a high court judge, so also one does not become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a simply by birthright but by acquiring the necessary qualifications of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. As the high court judgeship is a post for the qualified man, so also the post of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is attainable by qualification only. The \u015b\u0101stra enjoins that if good qualifications are seen in a person born in a family other than that of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the qualified man has to be accepted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and similarly if a person born in the family of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is void of brahminical qualification, then he must be treated as a non-br\u0101hma\u1e47a or, in better terms, a relative of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme authority of all religious principles, the Vedas, has personally pointed out these differences, and He is about to explain the reason for this in the following \u015blokas."

        "purport": " A life for a life is just punishment for a person who cruelly and shamelessly lives at the cost of another\u2019s life. Political morality is to punish a person by a death sentence in order to save a cruel person from going to hell. That a murderer is condemned to a death sentence by the state is good for the culprit because in his next life he will not have to suffer for his act of murder. Such a death sentence for the murderer is the lowest possible punishment offered to him, and it is said in the sm\u1e5bti-\u015b\u0101stras that men who are punished by the king on the principle of a life for a life are purified of all their sins, so much so that they may be eligible for being promoted to the planets of heaven. According to Manu, the great author of civic codes and religious principles, even the killer of an animal is to be considered a murderer because animal food is never meant for the civilized man, whose prime duty is to prepare himself for going back to Godhead. He says that in the act of killing an animal, there is a regular conspiracy by the party of sinners, and all of them are liable to be punished as murderers exactly like a party of conspirators who kill a human being combinedly. He who gives permission, he who kills the animal, he who sells the slaughtered animal, he who cooks the animal, he who administers distribution of the foodstuff, and at last he who eats such cooked animal food are all murderers, and all of them are liable to be punished by the laws of nature. No one can create a living being despite all advancement of material science, and therefore no one has the right to kill a living being by one\u2019s independent whims. For the animal-eaters, the scriptures have sanctioned restricted animal sacrifices only, and such sanctions are there just to restrict the opening of slaughterhouses and not to encourage animal-killing. The procedure under which animal sacrifice is allowed in the scriptures is good both for the animal sacrificed and the animal-eaters. It is good for the animal in the sense that the sacrificed animal is at once promoted to the human form of life after being sacrificed at the altar, and the animal-eater is saved from grosser types of sins (eating meats supplied by organized slaughterhouses which are ghastly places for breeding all kinds of material afflictions to society, country and the people in general). The material world is itself a place always full of anxieties, and by encouraging animal slaughter the whole atmosphere becomes polluted more and more by war, pestilence, famine and many other unwanted calamities."

In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord Himself has claimed Arjuna as His dearmost friend. Every living being is thus related with the Supreme Lord by some sort of affectionate relation, either as servant or as friend or as parent or as an object of conjugal love. Everyone thus can enjoy the company of the Lord in the spiritual realm if he at all desires and sincerely tries for it by the process of bhakti-yoga."

But when he was brought before \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Draupad\u012b, she, although begrieved for the murder of her sons, and although the murderer was present before her, could not withdraw the due respect generally offered to a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or to the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. This is due to her mild nature as a woman. Women as a class are no better than boys, and therefore they have no discriminatory power like that of a man. A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 proved himself to be an unworthy son of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya or of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and for this reason he was condemned by the greatest authority, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and yet a mild woman could not withdraw her natural courtesy for a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Even to date, in a Hindu family a woman shows proper respect to the br\u0101hma\u1e47a caste, however fallen and heinous a brahma-bandhu may be.

But, anyway, we should not give up our reason and discriminatory power just to be gentle. One must have good discriminatory power to judge a thing on its merit. We should not follow the mild nature of a woman and thereby accept that which is not genuine. A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 may be respected by a good-natured woman, but that does not mean that he is as good as a genuine br\u0101hma\u1e47a."

        "purport": " As soon as A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 was brought before Draupad\u012b, she thought it intolerable that a br\u0101hma\u1e47a should be arrested like a culprit and brought before her in that condition, especially when the br\u0101hma\u1e47a happened to be a teacher\u2019s son. Arjuna arrested A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 knowing perfectly well that he was the son of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also knew him to be so, but both of them condemned the murderer without consideration of his being the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. According to revealed scriptures, a teacher or spiritual master is liable to be rejected if he proves himself unworthy of the position of a guru or spiritual master. A guru is called also an \u0101c\u0101rya, or a person who has personally assimilated all the essence of \u015b\u0101stras and has helped his disciples to adopt the ways. A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 failed to discharge the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or teacher, and therefore he was liable to be rejected from the exalted position of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. On this consideration, both Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna were right in condemning A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101. But to a good lady like Draupad\u012b, the matter was considered not from the angle of \u015b\u0101stric vision, but as a matter of custom. By custom, A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 was offered the same respect as offered to his father. It was so because generally the people accept the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a as a real br\u0101hma\u1e47a, by sentiment only. Factually the matter is different. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is accepted on the merit of qualification and not on the merit of simply being the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. But in spite of all this, Draupad\u012b desired that A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 be at once released, and it was all the same a good sentiment for her. This means that a devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulation personally, but still such devotees are never unkind to others, even to the enemy. These are the characteristics of one who is a pure devotee of the Lord."

        "purport": " Dhanur-veda, or military science, was taught by Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya with all its confidential secrets of throwing and controlling by Vedic hymns. Gross military science is dependent on material weapons, but finer than that is the art of throwing the arrows saturated with Vedic hymns, which act more effectively than gross material weapons like machine guns or atomic bombs. The control is by Vedic mantras, or the transcendental science of sound. It is said in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Da\u015baratha, the father of Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101ma, used to control arrows by sound only. He could pierce his target with his arrow by only hearing the sound, without seeing the object. So this is a finer military science than that of the gross material military weapons used nowadays. Arjuna was taught all this, and therefore Draupad\u012b wished that Arjuna feel obliged to \u0100c\u0101rya Dro\u1e47a for all these benefits. And in the absence of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, his son was his representative. That was the opinion of the good lady Draupad\u012b. It may be argued why Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, a rigid br\u0101hma\u1e47a, should be a teacher in military science. But the reply is that a br\u0101hma\u1e47a should become a teacher, regardless of what his department of knowledge is. A learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a should become a teacher, a priest and a recipient of charity. A bona fide br\u0101hma\u1e47a is authorized to accept such professions."

The feeling of equality was there because Draupad\u012b spoke out of her personal experience. A barren woman cannot understand the grief of a mother.

Both Bh\u012bma and Draupad\u012b held opposite views about killing A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101. Bh\u012bma wanted him to be immediately killed, whereas Draupad\u012b wanted to save him. We can imagine Bh\u012bma ready to kill while Draupad\u012b is obstructing him. And in order to prevent both of them, the Lord discovered another two arms. Originally, the primeval Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a displays only two arms, but in His N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a feature He exhibits four.

Therefore, if \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called catur-bhuja\u1e25, there is no contradiction. If need be He can display hundreds of arms, as He exhibited in His vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa shown to Arjuna. Therefore, one who can display hundreds and thousands of arms can also manifest four whenever needed. When Arjuna was perplexed about what to do with A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the very dear friend of Arjuna, voluntarily took up the matter just to make a solution. And He was smiling also."

And according to the rulings of Manu, an aggressor, even though he be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a (and what to speak of an unworthy son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a), is to be killed. Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya was certainly a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in the true sense of the term, but because he stood in the battlefield he was killed. But although A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 was an aggressor, he stood without any fighting weapons. The ruling is that an aggressor, when he is without weapon or chariot, cannot be killed. All these were certainly perplexities. Besides that, Arjuna had to keep the promise he had made before Draupad\u012b just to pacify her. And he also had to satisfy both Bh\u012bma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who advised killing him. This dilemma was present before Arjuna, and the solution was awarded by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."
