When the Lord descends to the earth along with His eternal, ever-liberated associates, He not only displays the divine energy possessed by Himself, but also empowers His associate devotees with the required energy to execute His mission of incarnation. It is also stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.5) that the Lord and His eternal associates descend to the earth many times, but the Lord remembers all the different roles of incarnations, whereas the associates, by His supreme will, forget them. Similarly, the Lord takes away with Him all His associates when He disappears from the earth. The power and energy which were bestowed upon Arjuna were required for fulfillment of the mission of the Lord, but when His mission was fulfilled, the emergency powers were withdrawn from Arjuna because the astounding powers of Arjuna, which were astonishing even to the denizens of heaven, were no longer required, and they were not meant for going back home, back to Godhead. If endowment of powers and withdrawal of powers by the Lord are possible even for a great devotee like Arjuna, or even the demigods in heaven, then what to speak of the ordinary living beings who are but figs compared to such great souls. The lesson is, therefore, that no one should be puffed up for his powers borrowed from the Lord. The sane man should rather feel obliged to the Lord for such benefactions and must utilize such power for the service of the Lord. Such power can be withdrawn at any time by the Lord, so the best use of such power and opulence is to engage them in the service of the Lord."

        "translation": "Only by His merciful strength was I able to vanquish all the lusty princes assembled at the palace of King Drupada for the selection of the bridegroom. With my bow and arrow I could pierce the fish target and thereby gain the hand of Draupad\u012b.",
        "purport": " Draupad\u012b was the most beautiful daughter of King Drupada, and when she was a young girl almost all the princes desired her hand. But Drupada Mah\u0101r\u0101ja decided to hand over his daughter to Arjuna only and therefore contrived a peculiar way. There was a fish hanging on the inner roof of the house under the protection of a wheel. The condition was that out of the princely order, one must be able to pierce the fish\u2019s eyes through the wheel of protection, and no one would be allowed to look up at the target. On the ground there was a waterpot in which the target and wheel were reflected, and one had to fix his aim towards the target by looking at the trembling water in the pot. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Drupada well knew that only Arjuna or alternately Kar\u1e47a could successfully carry out the plan. But still he wanted to hand his daughter to Arjuna. And in the assembly of the princely order, when Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna, the brother of Draupad\u012b, introduced all the princes to his grown-up sister, Kar\u1e47a was also present in the game. But Draupad\u012b tactfully avoided Kar\u1e47a as the rival of Arjuna, and she expressed her desires through her brother Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna that she was unable to accept anyone who was less than a k\u1e63atriya. The vai\u015byas and the \u015b\u016bdras are less important than the k\u1e63atriyas. Kar\u1e47a was known as the son of a carpenter, a \u015b\u016bdra. So Draupad\u012b avoided Kar\u1e47a by this plea. When Arjuna, in the dress of a poor br\u0101hma\u1e47a, pierced the difficult target, everyone was astonished, and all of them, especially Kar\u1e47a, offered a stiff fight to Arjuna, but as usual by the grace of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he was able to emerge very successful in the princely fight and thus gain the valuable hand of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101, or Draupad\u012b. Arjuna was lamentingly remembering the incident in the absence of the Lord, by whose strength only he was so powerful."

And only by His grace was the demon named Maya saved from the blazing Kh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava Forest, and thus we could build our assembly house of wonderful architectural workmanship, where all the princes assembled during the performance of R\u0101jas\u016bya-yaj\u00f1a and paid you tributes.",
        "purport": " The demon Maya D\u0101nava was an inhabitant of the forest Kh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava, and when the Kh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava Forest was set on fire, he asked protection from Arjuna. Arjuna saved his life, and as a result of this the demon felt obliged. He reciprocated by building a wonderful assembly house for the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, which attracted the extraordinary attention of all state princes. They felt the supernatural power of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and thus without grudge all of them submitted and paid tributes to the Emperor. The demons possess wonderful and supernatural powers to create material wonders. But they are always disturbing elements of the society. The modern demons are the harmful material scientists who create some material wonders for disturbance in the society. For example, the creation of nuclear weapons has caused some panic in human society. Maya was also a materialist like that, and he knew the art of creating such wonderful things. And yet Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to kill him. When he was chased both by the fire and by the wheel of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he took shelter of such a devotee as Arjuna, who saved him from the wrath of the fire of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Devotees are therefore more merciful than the Lord, and in devotional service the mercy of a devotee is more valuable than the mercy of the Lord. Both the fire and the Lord ceased from chasing the demon as soon as both of them saw that the demon was given shelter by such a devotee as Arjuna. This demon, feeling obliged to Arjuna, wanted to do him some service to show his gratefulness, but Arjuna declined to accept anything from him in exchange. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, being pleased with Maya for his taking shelter of a devotee, asked him to render service unto King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira by building a wonderful assembly house. The process is that by the grace of the devotee the mercy of the Lord is obtained, and by the mercy of the Lord a chance to serve the Lord\u2019s devotee is obtained. The club of Bh\u012bmasena was also a gift of Maya D\u0101nava."

These kings had been brought for sacrifice in Jar\u0101sandha\u2019s Mah\u0101bhairava-yaj\u00f1a, but they were thus released. Later they paid tribute to Your Majesty.",
        "purport": " Jar\u0101sandha was a very powerful king of Magadha, and the history of his birth and activities is also very interesting. His father, King B\u1e5bhadratha, was also a very prosperous and powerful king of Magadha, but he had no son, although he married two daughters of the King of K\u0101\u015b\u012b. Being disappointed in not getting a son from either of the two queens, the King, along with his wives, left home to live in the forest for austerities, but in the forest he was benedicted by one great \u1e5b\u1e63i to have a son, and he gave him one mango to be eaten by the queens. The queens did so and were very soon pregnant. The King was very happy to see the queens bearing children, but when the ripe time approached, the queens delivered one child in two parts, one from each of the queens\u2019 wombs. The two parts were thrown in the forest, where a great she-demon used to live, and she was glad to have some delicate flesh and blood from the newly born child. Out of curiosity she joined the two parts, and the child became complete and regained life. The she-demon was known as Jar\u0101, and being compassionate on the childless King, she went to the King and presented him with the nice child. The King was very pleased with the she-demon and wanted to reward her according to her desire. The she-demon expressed her desire that the child be named after her, and thus the child was surnamed Jar\u0101sandha, or one who was joined by Jar\u0101, the she-demon. In fact, this Jar\u0101sandha was born as one of the parts and parcels of the demon Vipracitti. The saint by whose benedictions the queens bore the child was called Candra Kau\u015bika, who foretold of the child before his father B\u1e5bhadratha. Since Jar\u0101sandha possessed demoniac qualities from birth, naturally he became a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva, the lord of all ghostly and demoniac men. R\u0101va\u1e47a was a great devotee of \u015aiva, and so also Jar\u0101sandha. He used to sacrifice all arrested kings before Lord Mah\u0101bhairava (\u015aiva), and by his military power he defeated many small kings and arrested them to butcher before Mah\u0101bhairava. There are many devotees of Lord Mah\u0101bhairava, or K\u0101labhairava, in the province of Bihar, formerly called Magadha. Jar\u0101sandha was a relative of Ka\u1e41sa, the maternal uncle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore after Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s death King Jar\u0101sandha became a great enemy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and there were many fights between Jar\u0101sandha and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to kill him, but He also wanted that those who served as military men for Jar\u0101sandha might not be killed. Therefore a plan was adopted to kill him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Bh\u012bma and Arjuna together went to Jar\u0101sandha in the dress of poor br\u0101hma\u1e47as and begged charity from King Jar\u0101sandha. Jar\u0101sandha never refused charity to any br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and he performed many sacrifices also, yet he was not on a par with devotional service. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Bh\u012bma and Arjuna asked Jar\u0101sandha for the facility of fighting him, and it was settled that Jar\u0101sandha would fight with Bh\u012bma only. So all of them were both guests and combatants of Jar\u0101sandha, and Bh\u012bma and Jar\u0101sandha fought every day for several days. Bh\u012bma became disappointed, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave him hints about Jar\u0101sandha\u2019s being joined together as an infant, and thus Bh\u012bma dissected him again and so killed him. All the kings who were detained in the concentration camp to be killed before Mah\u0101bhairava were thus released by Bh\u012bma. Feeling thus obliged to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, they paid tribute to King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira."

But when she was lost in a bet, Du\u1e25\u015b\u0101sana touched her glorified hair to insult her. Draupad\u012b then fell down at the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a decided that all the wives of Du\u1e25\u015b\u0101sana and company should have their hair loosened as a result of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Thus after the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, after all the sons and grandsons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra died in battle, all the wives of the family were obliged to loosen their hair as widows. In other words, all the wives of the Kuru family became widows because of Du\u1e25\u015b\u0101sana\u2019s insulting a great devotee of the Lord. The Lord can tolerate insults upon Himself by any miscreant because the father tolerates even insults from the son. But He never tolerates insults upon His devotees. By insulting a great soul, one has to forgo all the results of pious acts and benedictions also."

At that time He [Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], simply by accepting the remnants of food, saved us. By His accepting food thus, the assembly of munis, while bathing in the river, felt sumptuously fed. And all the three worlds were also satisfied.",
        "purport": " Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni: A powerful mystic br\u0101hma\u1e47a determined to observe the principles of religion with great vows and under strict austerities. His name is associated with many historical events, and it appears that the great mystic could be both easily satisfied and easily annoyed, like Lord \u015aiva. When he was satisfied, he could do tremendous good to the servitor, but if he was dissatisfied he could bring about the greatest calamity. Kum\u0101r\u012b Kunt\u012b, at her father\u2019s house, used to minister all kinds of services to all great br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and being satisfied with her good reception Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni benedicted her with a power to call any demigod she desired. It is understood that he was a plenary incarnation of Lord \u015aiva, and thus he could be either easily satisfied or annoyed. He was a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva, and by Lord \u015aiva\u2019s order he accepted the priesthood of King \u015avetaketu because of the King\u2019s performance of sacrifice for one hundred years. Sometimes he used to visit the parliamentary assembly of the heavenly kingdom of Indradeva. He could travel in space by his great mystic powers, and it is understood that he traveled a great distance through space, even up to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets beyond material space. He traveled all these long distances within one year, during his quarrel with King Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, the great devotee and Emperor of the world. He had about ten thousand disciples, and wherever he visited and became a guest of the great k\u1e63atriya kings, he used to be accompanied by a number of followers. Once he visited the house of Duryodhana, the enemy cousin of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Duryodhana was intelligent enough to satisfy the br\u0101hma\u1e47a by all means, and the great \u1e5b\u1e63i wanted to give some benediction to Duryodhana. Duryodhana knew his mystic powers, and he knew also that the mystic br\u0101hma\u1e47a, if dissatisfied, could cause some havoc, and thus he designed to engage the br\u0101hma\u1e47a to show his wrath upon his enemy cousins, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. When the \u1e5b\u1e63i wanted to award some benediction to Duryodhana, the latter wished that he should visit the house of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, who was the eldest and chief among all his cousins. But by his request he would go to him after he had finished his meals with his Queen, Draupad\u012b. Duryodhana knew that after Draupad\u012b\u2019s dinner it would be impossible for Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to receive such a large number of br\u0101hma\u1e47a guests, and thus the \u1e5b\u1e63i would be annoyed and would create some trouble for his cousin Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. That was the plan of Duryodhana. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni agreed to this proposal, and he approached the King in exile, according to the plan of Duryodhana, after the King and Draupad\u012b had finished their meals. On his arrival at the door of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, he was at once well received, and the King requested him to finish his noontime religious rites in the river, for by that time the foodstuff would be prepared. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, along with his large number of disciples, went to take a bath in the river, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was in great anxiety about the guests. As long as Draupad\u012b had not taken her meals, food could be served to any number of guests, but the \u1e5b\u1e63i, by the plan of Duryodhana, reached there after Draupad\u012b had finished her meals. When the devotees are put into difficulty, they have an opportunity to recollect the Lord with rapt attention. So Draupad\u012b was thinking of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in that dangerous position, and the all-pervading Lord could at once know the dangerous position of His devotees. He therefore came there on the scene and asked Draupad\u012b to give whatever food she might have in her stock. On her being so requested by the Lord, Draupad\u012b was sorrowful because the Supreme Lord asked her for some food and she was unable to supply it at that time. She said to the Lord that the mysterious dish which she had received from the sun-god could supply any amount of food if she herself had not eaten. But on that day she had already taken her meals, and thus they were in danger. By expressing her difficulties she began to cry before the Lord as only a woman would do in such a position. The Lord, however, asked Draupad\u012b to bring up the cooking pots to see if there was any particle of foodstuff left, and on Draupad\u012b\u2019s doing so, the Lord found some particle of vegetable sticking to the pot. The Lord at once picked it up and ate it. After doing so, the Lord asked Draupad\u012b to call for her guests, the company of Durv\u0101s\u0101. Bh\u012bma was sent to call them from the river. Bh\u012bma said, \u201cWhy are you delaying, sirs? Come on, the food is ready for you.\u201d But the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, because of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s accepting a little particle of food, felt sumptuously fed, even while they were in the water. They thought that since Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira must have prepared many valuable dishes for them and since they were not hungry and could not eat, the King would feel very sorry, so it was better not to go there. Thus they decided to go away. This incident proves that the Lord is the greatest mystic, and therefore He is known as Yoge\u015bvara. Another instruction is that every householder must offer food to the Lord, and the result will be that everyone, even a company of guests numbering ten thousand, will be satisfied because of the Lord\u2019s being satisfied. That is the way of devotional service."

Thus he [Lord \u015aiva] became pleased with me and awarded me his own weapon. Other demigods also delivered their respective weapons to me, and in addition I was able to reach the heavenly planets in this present body and was allowed a half-elevated seat.",
        "purport": " By the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all the demigods, including Lord \u015aiva, were pleased with Arjuna. The idea is that one who is favored by Lord \u015aiva or any other demigod may not necessarily be favored by the Supreme Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. R\u0101va\u1e47a was certainly a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva, but he could not be saved from the wrath of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord R\u0101macandra. And there are many instances like that in the histories of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. But here is an instance where we can see that Lord \u015aiva became pleased even in the fight with Arjuna. The devotees of the Supreme Lord know how to respect the demigods, but the devotees of the demigods sometimes foolishly think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is no greater than the demigods. By such a conception, one becomes an offender and ultimately meets with the same end as R\u0101va\u1e47a and others. The instances described by Arjuna during his friendly dealings with Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are instructive for all who may be convinced by the lessons that one can achieve all favors simply by pleasing the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas the devotees or worshipers of the demigods may achieve only partial benefits, which are also perishable, just as the demigods themselves are. Another significance of the present verse is that Arjuna, by the grace of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was able to reach the heavenly planet even with the selfsame body and was honored by the heavenly demigod Indradeva, being seated with him half elevated. One can reach the heavenly planets by the pious acts recommended in the \u015b\u0101stras in the category of fruitive activities. And as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.21), when the reactions of such pious acts are spent, the enjoyer is again degraded to this earthly planet. The moon is also on the level with the heavenly planets, and only persons who have performed virtues only \u2014 performing sacrifices, giving charity and undergoing severe austerities \u2014 can be allowed to enter into the heavenly planets after the duration of life of the body. Arjuna was allowed to enter into the heavenly planets in the selfsame body simply by the grace of the Lord, otherwise it is not possible to do so. The present attempts to enter into the heavenly planets by the modern scientists will certainly prove futile because such scientists are not on the level of Arjuna. They are ordinary human beings, without any assets of sacrifice, charity or austerities. The material body is influenced by the three modes of material nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. The present population is more or less influenced by the modes of passion and ignorance, and the symptoms for such influence are exhibited in their becoming very lusty and greedy. Such degraded fellows can hardly approach the higher planetary systems. Above the heavenly planets there are many other planets also, which only those who are influenced by goodness can reach. In heavenly and other planets within the universe, the inhabitants are all highly intelligent, many more times than the human beings, and they are all pious in the higher and highest mode of goodness. They are all devotees of the Lord, and although their goodness is not unadulterated, still they are known as demigods possessing the maximum amount of good qualities possible within the material world."

Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, a small child of only five years, became the object of envy for his great father, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, only because of his becoming a pure devotee of the Lord. The demon father employed all his weapons to kill the devotee son, Prahl\u0101da, but by the grace of the Lord he was saved from all sorts of dangerous actions by his father. He was thrown in a fire, in boiling oil, from the top of a hill, underneath the legs of an elephant, and he was administered poison. At last the father himself took up a chopper to kill his son, and thus N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva appeared and killed the heinous father in the presence of the son. Thus no one can kill the devotee of the Lord. Similarly, Arjuna was also saved by the Lord, although all dangerous weapons were employed by his great opponents like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma. Kar\u1e47a: Born of Kunt\u012b by the sun-god prior to her marriage with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, Kar\u1e47a took his birth with bangles and earrings, extraordinary signs for an undaunted hero. In the beginning his name was Vasusena, but when he grew up he presented his natural bangles and earrings to Indradeva, and thenceforward he became known as Vaikartana. After his birth from the maiden Kunt\u012b, he was thrown in the Ganges. Later he was picked up by Adhiratha, and he and his wife R\u0101dh\u0101 brought him up as their own offspring. Kar\u1e47a was very charitable, especially toward the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. There was nothing he could not spare for a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. In the same charitable spirit he gave in charity his natural bangles and earrings to Indradeva, who, being very much satisfied with him, gave him in return a great weapon called \u015aakti. He was admitted as one of the students of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, and from the very beginning there was some rivalry between him and Arjuna. Seeing his constant rivalry with Arjuna, Duryodhana picked him up as his companion, and this gradually grew into greater intimacy. He was also present in the great assembly of Draupad\u012b\u2019s svaya\u1e41vara function, and when he attempted to exhibit his talent in that meeting, Draupad\u012b\u2019s brother declared that Kar\u1e47a could not take part in the competition because of his being the son of a \u015b\u016bdra carpenter. Although he was refused in the competition, still when Arjuna was successful in piercing the fish target on the ceiling and Draupad\u012b bestowed her garland upon Arjuna, Kar\u1e47a and the other disappointed princes offered an unusual stumbling block to Arjuna while he was leaving with Draupad\u012b. Specifically, Kar\u1e47a fought with him very valiantly, but all of them were defeated by Arjuna. Duryodhana was very much pleased with Kar\u1e47a because of his constant rivalry with Arjuna, and when he was in power he enthroned Kar\u1e47a in the state of A\u1e45ga. Being baffled in his attempt to win Draupad\u012b, Kar\u1e47a advised Duryodhana to attack King Drupada, for after defeating him both Arjuna and Draupad\u012b could be arrested. But Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya rebuked them for this conspiracy, and they refrained from the action. Kar\u1e47a was defeated many times, not only by Arjuna but also by Bh\u012bmasena. He was the king of the kingdom of Bengal, Orissa and Madras combined. Later on he took an active part in the R\u0101jas\u016bya sacrifice of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, and when there was gambling between the rival brothers, designed by \u015aakuni, Kar\u1e47a took part in the game, and he was very pleased when Draupad\u012b was offered as a bet in the gambling. This fed his old grudge. When Draupad\u012b was in the game he was very enthusiastic to declare the news, and it is he who ordered Du\u1e25\u015b\u0101sana to take away the garments of both the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and Draupad\u012b. He asked Draupad\u012b to select another husband because, being lost by the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, she was rendered a slave of the Kurus. He was always an enemy of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and whenever there was an opportunity, he tried to curb them by all means. During the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, he foresaw the conclusive result, and he expressed his opinion that due to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s being the chariot driver of Arjuna, the battle should be won by Arjuna. He always differed with Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, and sometimes he was proud enough to say that within five days he could finish up the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, if Bh\u012b\u1e63ma would not interfere with his plan of action. But he was much mortified when Bh\u012b\u1e63ma died. He killed Gha\u1e6dotkaca with the \u015aakti weapon obtained from Indradeva. His son, V\u1e5b\u1e63asena, was killed by Arjuna. He killed the largest number of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava soldiers. At last there was a severe fight with Arjuna, and it was he only who was able to knock off the helmet of Arjuna. But it so happened that the wheel of his chariot stuck in the battlefield mud, and when he got down to set the wheel right, Arjuna took the opportunity and killed him, although he requested Arjuna not to do so. Napt\u0101, or Bh\u016bri\u015brav\u0101: Bh\u016bri\u015brav\u0101 was the son of Somadatta, a member of the Kuru family. His other brother was \u015aalya. Both the brothers and the father attended the svaya\u1e41vara ceremony of Draupad\u012b. All of them appreciated the wonderful strength of Arjuna due to his being the devotee friend of the Lord, and thus Bh\u016bri\u015brav\u0101 advised the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra not to pick any quarrel or fight with them. All of them also attended the R\u0101jas\u016bya-yaj\u00f1a of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. He possessed one ak\u1e63auhi\u1e47\u012b regiment of army, cavalry, elephants and chariots, and all these were employed in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra on behalf of Duryodhana\u2019s party. He was counted by Bh\u012bma as one of the y\u016btha-patis. In the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra he was especially engaged in a fight with S\u0101tyaki, and he killed ten sons of S\u0101tyaki. Later on, Arjuna cut off his hands, and he was ultimately killed by S\u0101tyaki. After his death he merged into the existence of Vi\u015bvadeva. Trigarta, or Su\u015barm\u0101: Son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja V\u1e5bddhak\u1e63etra, he was the King of Trigartade\u015ba, and he was also present in the svaya\u1e41vara ceremony of Draupad\u012b. He was one of the allies of Duryodhana, and he advised Duryodhana to attack the Matsyade\u015ba (Darbha\u1e45ga). During the time of cow-stealing in Vir\u0101\u1e6da-nagara, he was able to arrest Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Vir\u0101\u1e6da, but later Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Vir\u0101\u1e6da was released by Bh\u012bma. In the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra he also fought very valiantly, but at the end he was killed by Arjuna. Jayadratha: Another son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja V\u1e5bddhak\u1e63etra. He was the King of Sindhude\u015ba (modern Sind Pakistan). His wife\u2019s name was Du\u1e25\u015bal\u0101. He was also present in the svaya\u1e41vara ceremony of Draupad\u012b, and he desired very strongly to have her hand, but he failed in the competition. But since then he always sought the opportunity to get in touch with Draupad\u012b. When he was going to marry in the \u015aalyade\u015ba, on the way to K\u0101myavana he happened to see Draupad\u012b again and was too much attracted to her. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and Draupad\u012b were then in exile, after losing their empire in gambling, and Jayadratha thought it wise to send news to Draupad\u012b in an illicit manner through Ko\u1e6di\u015ba\u1e63ya, one of his associates. Draupad\u012b at once refused vehemently the proposal of Jayadratha, but being so much attracted by the beauty of Draupad\u012b, he tried again and again. Every time he was refused by Draupad\u012b. He tried to take her away forcibly on his chariot, and at first Draupad\u012b gave him a good dashing, and he fell like a cut-root tree. But he was not discouraged, and he was able to force Draupad\u012b to sit on the chariot. This incident was seen by Dhaumya Muni, and he strongly protested the action of Jayadratha. He also followed the chariot, and through Dh\u0101treyik\u0101 the matter was brought to the notice of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas then attacked the soldiers of Jayadratha and killed them all, and at last Bh\u012bma caught hold of Jayadratha and beat him very severely, almost dead. Then all but five hairs were cut off his head and he was taken to all the kings and introduced as the slave of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. He was forced to admit himself to be the slave of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira before all the princely order, and in the same condition he was brought before Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was kind enough to order him released, and when he admitted to being a tributary prince under Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Queen Draupad\u012b also desired his release. After this incident, he was allowed to return to his country. Being so insulted, he went to Ga\u1e45gotri in the Him\u0101layas and undertook a severe type of penance to please Lord \u015aiva. He asked his benediction to defeat all the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, at least one at a time. Then the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra began, and he took sides with Duryodhana. In the first day\u2019s fight he was engaged with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Drupada, then with Vir\u0101\u1e6da and then with Abhimanyu. While Abhimanyu was being killed, mercilessly surrounded by seven great generals, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas came to his help, but Jayadratha, by the mercy of Lord \u015aiva, repulsed them with great ability. At this, Arjuna took a vow to kill him, and on hearing this, Jayadratha wanted to leave the warfield and asked permission from the Kauravas for this cowardly action. But he was not allowed to do so. On the contrary, he was obliged to fight with Arjuna, and while the fight was going on Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reminded Arjuna that the benediction of \u015aiva upon Jayadratha was that whoever would cause his head to fall on the ground would die at once. He therefore advised Arjuna to throw the head of Jayadratha directly onto the lap of his father, who was engaged in penances at the Samanta-pa\u00f1caka pilgrimage. This was actually done by Arjuna. Jayadratha\u2019s father was surprised to see a severed head on his lap, and he at once threw it to the ground. The father immediately died, his forehead being cracked in seven pieces."

        "purport": " The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the object of worship both by impersonalists and by the devotees of the Lord. The impersonalists worship His glowing effulgence, emanating from His transcendental body of eternal form, bliss and knowledge, and the devotees worship Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are below even the impersonalists consider Him to be one of the great historical personalities. The Lord, however, descends to attract all by His specific transcendental pastimes, and thus He plays the part of the most perfect master, friend, son and lover. His transcendental relation with Arjuna was in friendship, and the Lord therefore played the part perfectly, as He did with His parents, lovers and wives. While playing in such a perfect transcendental relation, the devotee forgets, by the internal potency of the Lord, that his friend or son is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although sometimes the devotee is bewildered by the acts of the Lord. After the departure of the Lord, Arjuna was conscious of his great friend, but there was no mistake on the part of Arjuna, nor any ill estimation of the Lord. Intelligent men are attracted by the transcendental acting of the Lord with a pure, unalloyed devotee like Arjuna. In the warfield, scarcity of water is a well-known fact. Water is very rare there, and both the animals and men, working strenuously on the warfield, constantly require water to quench their thirst. Especially wounded soldiers and generals feel very thirsty at the time of death, and it sometimes so happens that simply for want of water one has to die unavoidably. But such scarcity of water was solved in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra by means of boring the ground. By God\u2019s grace, water can be easily obtained from any place if there is facility for boring the ground. The modern system works on the same principle of boring the ground, but modern engineers are still unable to dig immediately wherever necessary. It appears, however, from the history as far back as the days of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, that big generals like Arjuna could at once supply water even to the horses, and what to speak of men, by drawing water from underneath the hard ground simply by penetrating the stratum with a sharp arrow, a method still unknown to the modern scientists."

In these Pur\u0101\u1e47as it is said that once the fair denizens of heaven pleased A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101vakra Muni by their service and were blessed by the muni to have the Supreme Lord as their husband. A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101vakra Muni was curved in eight joints of his body, and thus he used to move in a peculiar curved manner. The daughters of the demigods could not check their laughter upon seeing the movements of the muni, and the muni, being angry at them, cursed them that they would be kidnapped by rogues, even if they would get the Lord as their husband. Later on, the girls again satisfied the muni by their prayers, and the muni blessed them that they would regain their husband even after being robbed by the rogues. So, in order to keep the words of the great muni, the Lord Himself kidnapped His wives from the protection of Arjuna, otherwise they would have at once vanished from the scene as soon as they were touched by the rogues. Besides that, some of the gop\u012bs who prayed to become wives of the Lord returned to their respective positions after their desire was fulfilled. After the departure of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He wanted all His entourage back to Godhead, and they were called back under different conditions only."

In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is confirmed that the law of nature is executed under the direction of the Lord.

And whenever there is upheaval in the world, it is also due to the supreme will of the Lord. Not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Lord. Whenever, therefore, there is disobedience of the established rules enacted by the Lord, there is war between men and nations. The surest way to the path of peace, therefore, is dovetailing everything to the established rule of the Lord. The established rule is that whatever we do, whatever we eat, whatever we sacrifice or whatever we give in charity must be done to the full satisfaction of the Lord. No one should do anything, eat anything, sacrifice anything or give anything in charity against the will of the Lord. Discretion is the better part of valor, and one must learn how to discriminate between actions which may be pleasing to the Lord and those which may not be pleasing to the Lord. An action is thus judged by the Lord\u2019s pleasure or displeasure. There is no room for personal whims; we must always be guided by the pleasure of the Lord. Such action is called yoga\u1e25 karmasu kau\u015balam, or actions performed which are linked with the Supreme Lord. That is the art of doing a thing perfectly."

        "purport": " Herein Arjuna refers to the instruction of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which was imparted to him by the Lord on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. The Lord left behind Him the instructions of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 not for the benefit of Arjuna alone, but also for all time and in all lands. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the essence of all Vedic wisdom. It is nicely presented by the Lord Himself for all who have very little time to go through the vast Vedic literatures like the Upani\u1e63ads, Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras. It is put within the study of the great historical epic Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, which was especially prepared for the less intelligent class, namely the women, the laborers and those who are worthless descendants of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and higher sections of the vai\u015byas. The problem which arose in the heart of Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra was solved by the teachings of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Again, after the departure of the Lord from the vision of earthly people, when Arjuna was face to face with being vanquished in his acquired power and prominence, he wanted again to remember the great teachings of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 just to teach all concerned that the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 can be consulted in all critical times, not only for solace from all kinds of mental agonies, but also for the way out of great entanglements which may embarrass one in some critical hour. The merciful Lord left behind Him the great teachings of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 so that one can take the instructions of the Lord even when He is not visible to material eyesight. Material senses cannot have any estimation of the Supreme Lord, but by His inconceivable power the Lord can incarnate Himself to the sense perception of the conditioned souls in a suitable manner through the agency of matter, which is also another form of the Lord\u2019s manifested energy. Thus the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or any authentic scriptural sound representation of the Lord, is also the incarnation of the Lord. There is no difference between the sound representation of the Lord and the Lord Himself. One can derive the same benefit from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as Arjuna did in the personal presence of the Lord. The faithful human being who is desirous of being liberated from the clutches of material existence can very easily take advantage of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and with this in view, the Lord instructed Arjuna as if Arjuna were in need of it. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, five important factors of knowledge have been delineated pertaining to (1) the Supreme Lord, (2) the living being, (3) nature, (4) time and space and (5) the process of activity. Out of these, the Supreme Lord and the living being are qualitatively one. The difference between the two has been analyzed as the difference between the whole and the part and parcel. Nature is inert matter displaying the interaction of three different modes, and eternal time and unlimited space are considered to be beyond the existence of the material nature. Activities of the living being are different varieties of aptitudes which can entrap or liberate the living being within and without material nature. All these subject matters are concisely discussed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and later the subject matters are elaborated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam for further enlightenment. Out of the five subjects, the Supreme Lord, the living entity, nature, and time and space are eternal, but the living entity, nature and time are under the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is absolute and completely independent of any other control. The Supreme Lord is the supreme controller. The material activity of the living being is beginningless, but it can be rectified by transferral into the spiritual quality. Thus it can cease its material qualitative reactions. Both the Lord and the living entity are cognizant, and both have the sense of identification, of being conscious as a living force. But the living being under the condition of material nature, called mahat-tattva, misidentifies himself as being different from the Lord. The whole scheme of Vedic wisdom is targeted to the aim of eradicating such a misconception and thus liberating the living being from the illusion of material identification. When such an illusion is eradicated by knowledge and renunciation, the living beings are responsible actors and enjoyers also. The sense of enjoyment in the Lord is real, but such a sense in the living being is a sort of wishful desire only. This difference in consciousness is the distinction of the two identities, namely the Lord and the living being. Otherwise there is no difference between the Lord and the living being. The living being is therefore eternally one and different simultaneously. The whole instruction of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 stands on this principle. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord and the living beings are both described as san\u0101tana, or eternal, and the Lord\u2019s abode, far beyond the material sky, is also described as san\u0101tana. The living being is invited to live in the san\u0101tana existence of the Lord, and the process which can help a living being to approach the Lord\u2019s abode, where the liberated activity of the soul is exhibited, is called san\u0101tana-dharma. One cannot, however, reach the eternal abode of the Lord without being free from the misconception of material identification, and the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives us the clue how to achieve this stage of perfection. The process of being liberated from the misconception of material identification is called, in different stages, fruitive activity, empiric philosophy and devotional service, up to transcendental realization. Such transcendental realization is made possible by dovetailing all the above items in relation with the Lord. Prescribed duties of the human being, as directed in the Vedas, can gradually purify the sinful mind of the conditioned soul and raise him to the stage of knowledge. The purified stage of acquiring knowledge becomes the basis of devotional service to the Lord. As long as one is engaged in researching the solution of the problems of life, his knowledge is called j\u00f1\u0101na, or purified knowledge, but on realizing the actual solution of life, one becomes situated in the devotional service of the Lord. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 begins with the problems of life by discriminating the soul from the elements of matter and proves by all reason and argument that the soul is indestructible in all circumstances and that the outer covering of matter, the body and the mind, change for another term of material existence, which is full of miseries. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is therefore meant for terminating all different types of miseries, and Arjuna took shelter of this great knowledge, which had been imparted to him during the Kuruk\u1e63etra battle."

Only those instructions began to eliminate the tinges of material contamination in the mind of Arjuna. The Lord is like the sun; the sun\u2019s appearance means immediate dissipation of darkness, or ignorance, and the Lord\u2019s appearance within the mind of the devotee can at once drive away the miserable material effects. Lord Caitanya has therefore recommended constant chanting of the name of the Lord for protection from all contamination of the material world. The feeling of separation from the Lord is undoubtedly painful to the devotee, but because it is in connection with the Lord, it has a specific transcendental effect which pacifies the heart. Feelings of separation are also sources of transcendental bliss, and they are never comparable to contaminated material feelings of separation."

        "purport": " A conditioned soul is enwrapped in his fruitive activities by the force of eternal time. But the Supreme Lord, when He incarnates on the earth, is not influenced by k\u0101la, or the material conception of past, present and future. The activities of the Lord are eternal, and they are manifestations of His \u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101, or internal potency. All pastimes or activities of the Lord are spiritual in nature, but to the laymen they appear to be on the same level with material activities. It so appeared that Arjuna and the Lord were engaged in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra as the other party was also engaged, but factually the Lord was executing His mission of incarnation and association with His eternal friend Arjuna. Therefore such apparently material activities of Arjuna did not drive him away from his transcendental position, but on the contrary revived his consciousness of the songs of the Lord, as He sang them personally. This revival of consciousness is assured by the Lord in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.65) as follows: One should think of the Lord always; the mind should not forget Him. One should become a devotee of the Lord and offer obeisances unto Him. One who lives in that fashion becomes undoubtedly endowed with the blessing of the Lord by achieving the shelter of His lotus feet. There is nothing to doubt about this eternal truth. Because Arjuna was His confidential friend, the secret was disclosed to him. Arjuna had no desire to fight with his relatives, but he fought for the mission of the Lord. He was always engaged in the execution of His mission only, and therefore after the Lord\u2019s departure he remained in the same transcendental position, even though it appeared that he forgot all the instructions of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One should, therefore, adjust the activities of life in pace with the mission of the Lord, and by doing this one is sure to return back home, back to Godhead. This is the highest perfection of life."

        "translation": "Because of his possessing spiritual assets, the doubts of duality were completely cut off. Thus he was freed from the three modes of material nature and placed in transcendence. There was no longer any chance of his becoming entangled in birth and death, for he was freed from material form.",
        "purport": " Doubts of duality begin from the misconception of the material body, which is accepted as the self by less intelligent persons. The most foolish part of our ignorance is our identifying this material body with the self. Everything in relation with the body is ignorantly accepted as our own. Doubts due to misconceptions of \u201cmyself\u201d and \u201cmine\u201d \u2014 in other words, \u201cmy body,\u201d \u201cmy relatives,\u201d \u201cmy property,\u201d \u201cmy wife,\u201d \u201cmy children,\u201d \u201cmy wealth,\u201d \u201cmy country,\u201d \u201cmy community\u201d and hundreds and thousands of similar illusory contemplations \u2014 cause bewilderment for the conditioned soul. By assimilating the instructions of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one is sure to be released from such bewilderment because real knowledge is knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is everything, including one\u2019s self. Everything is a manifestation of His potency as part and parcel. The potency and the potent are nondifferent, so the conception of duality is at once mitigated by attainment of perfect knowledge. As soon as Arjuna took up the instructions of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, expert as he was, he could at once eradicate the material conception of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his eternal friend. He could realize that the Lord was still present before him by His instruction, by His form, by His pastimes, by His qualities and everything else related to Him. He could realize that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his friend, was still present before him by His transcendental presence in different nondual energies, and there was no question of attainment of the association of the Lord by another change of body under the influence of time and space. By attainment of absolute knowledge, one can be in association with the Lord constantly, even in this present life, simply by hearing, chanting, thinking of and worshiping the Supreme Lord. One can see Him, one can feel His presence even in this present life, simply by understanding the advaya-j\u00f1\u0101na Lord, or the Absolute Lord, through the process of devotional service, which begins with hearing about Him. Lord Caitanya says that simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord one can at once wash off the dust on the mirror of pure consciousness, and as soon as the dust is removed, one is at once freed from all material conditions. To become free from material conditions means to liberate the soul. As soon as one is, therefore, situated in absolute knowledge, his material conception of life is removed, or he emerges from a false conception of life. Thus the function of the pure soul is revived in spiritual realization. This practical realization of the living being is made possible due to his becoming free from the reaction of the three modes of material nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. By the grace of the Lord, a pure devotee is at once raised to the place of the Absolute, and there is no chance of the devotee\u2019s becoming materially entangled again in conditioned life. One is not able to feel the presence of the Lord in all circumstances until one is endowed with the required transcendental vision made possible by devotional service prescribed in the revealed scriptures. Arjuna had attained this stage long before on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and when he apparently felt the absence of the Lord, he at once took shelter of the instructions of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and thus again he was placed in his original position. This is the position of vi\u015boka, or the stage of being freed from all grief and anxieties."

He began to deliberate on the Lord\u2019s way of appearance and departure. The mission of the Lord\u2019s appearance and disappearance in the mortal universe is completely dependent on His supreme will. He is not forced to appear or disappear by any superior energy, as the living beings appear and disappear, being forced by the laws of nature. Whenever the Lord likes, He can appear Himself from anywhere and everywhere without disturbing His appearance and disappearance in any other place. He is like the sun. The sun appears and disappears on its own accord at any place without disturbing its presence in other places. The sun appears in the morning in India without disappearing from the Western Hemisphere. The sun is present everywhere and anywhere all over the solar system, but it so appears that in a particular place the sun appears in the morning and also disappears at some fixed time in the evening. The time limitation even of the sun is of no concern, and so what to speak of the Supreme Lord who is the creator and controller of the sun. Therefore, in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated that anyone who factually understands the transcendental appearance and disappearance of the Lord by His inconceivable energy becomes liberated from the laws of birth and death and is placed in the eternal spiritual sky where the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are. There such liberated persons can eternally live without the pangs of birth, death, old age and disease. In the spiritual sky the Lord and those who are eternally engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are all eternally young because there is no old age and disease and there is no death. Because there is no death there is no birth. It is concluded, therefore, that simply by understanding the Lord\u2019s appearance and disappearance in truth, one can attain the perfectional stage of eternal life. Therefore, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira also began to consider going back to Godhead. The Lord appears on the earth or any other mortal planet along with His associates who live with Him eternally, and the members of the Yadu family who were engaged in supplementing the pastimes of the Lord are no other than His eternal associates, and so also Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and his brothers and mother, etc. Since the appearance and disappearance of the Lord and His eternal associates are transcendental, one should not be bewildered by the external features of appearance and disappearance."

        "purport": " The setting of the sun does not mean the end of the sun. It means that the sun is out of our sight. Similarly, the end of the mission of the Lord on a particular planet or universe only means that He is out of our sight. The end of the Yadu dynasty also does not mean that it is annihilated. It disappears, along with the Lord, out of our sight. As Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira decided to prepare to go back to Godhead, so also Kunt\u012b decided, and thus she fully engaged herself in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord which guarantees one a passport for going back to Godhead after quitting this present material body. The beginning of devotional service to the Lord is the beginning of spiritualizing the present body, and thus an unalloyed devotee of the Lord loses all material contact in the present body. The abode of the Lord is not a myth, as is thought by the unbelievers or ignorant people, but one cannot reach there by any material means like a sputnik or space capsule. But one can certainly reach there after leaving this present body, and one must prepare himself to go back to Godhead by practicing devotional service. That guarantees a passport for going back to Godhead, and Kunt\u012b adopted it."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura suggests that the \u1e5b\u1e63is like \u015aaunaka and others who were hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b at Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya were not happy to hear about the Yadus\u2019 dying in the madness of intoxication. To give them relief from this mental agony, S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b assured them that the Lord caused the members of the Yadu dynasty to relinquish their bodies by which they had to take away the burden of the world. The Lord and His eternal associates appeared on earth to help the administrative demigods in eradicating the burden of the world. He therefore called for some of the confidential demigods to appear in the Yadu family and serve Him in His great mission. After the mission was fulfilled, the demigods, by the will of the Lord, relinquished their corporeal bodies by fighting amongst themselves in the madness of intoxication. The demigods are accustomed to drinking the soma-rasa beverage, and therefore the drinking of wine and intoxication are not unknown to them. Sometimes they were put into trouble for indulging in intoxication. Once the sons of Kuvera fell in the wrath of N\u0101rada for being intoxicated, but afterwards they regained their original forms by the grace of the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We shall find this story in the Tenth Canto. For the Supreme Lord, both the asuras and the demigods are equal, but the demigods are obedient to the Lord, whereas the asuras are not. Therefore, the example of picking out a thorn by another thorn is quite befitting. One thorn, which causes pinpricks on the leg of the Lord, is certainly disturbing to the Lord, and the other thorn, which takes out the disturbing elements, certainly gives service to the Lord. So although every living being is a part and parcel of the Lord, still one who is a pinprick to the Lord is called an asura, and one who is a voluntary servitor of the Lord is called a devat\u0101, or demigod. In the material world the devat\u0101s and asuras are always contending, and the devat\u0101s are always saved from the hands of the asuras by the Lord. Both of them are under the control of the Lord. The world is full of two kinds of living beings, and the Lord\u2019s mission is always to protect the devat\u0101s and destroy the asuras, whenever there is such a need in the world, and to do good to both of them."

        "translation": "The Supreme Lord relinquished the body which He manifested to diminish the burden of the earth. Just like a magician, He relinquishes one body to accept different ones, like the fish incarnation and others.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is neither impersonal nor formless, but His body is nondifferent from Him, and therefore He is known as the embodiment of eternity, knowledge and bliss. In the B\u1e5bhad-vai\u1e63\u1e47ava Tantra it is clearly mentioned that anyone who considers the form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be made of material energy must be ostracized by all means. And if by chance the face of such an infidel is seen, one must clean himself by jumping in the river with his clothing. The Lord is described as am\u1e5bta, or deathless, because He has no material body. Under the circumstances, the Lord\u2019s dying or quitting His body is like the jugglery of a magician. The magician shows by his tricks that he is cut to pieces, burnt to ashes or made unconscious by hypnotic influences, but all are false shows only. Factually the magician himself is neither burnt to ashes nor cut to pieces, nor is he dead or unconscious at any stage of his magical demonstration. Similarly, the Lord has His eternal forms of unlimited variety, of which the fish incarnation, as was exhibited within this universe, is also one. Because there are innumerable universes, somewhere or other the fish incarnation must be manifesting His pastimes without cessation. In this verse, the particular word dhatte (\u201ceternally accepted,\u201d and not the word dhitv\u0101, \u201caccepted for the occasion\u201d) is used. The idea is that the Lord does not create the fish incarnation; He eternally has such a form, and the appearance and disappearance of such an incarnation serves particular purposes. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.24-25) the Lord says, \u201cThe impersonalists think that I have no form, that I am formless, but that at present I have accepted a form to serve a purpose, and now I am manifested. But such speculators are factually without sharp intelligence. Though they may be good scholars in the Vedic literatures, they are practically ignorant of My inconceivable energies and My eternal forms of personality. The reason is that I reserve the power of not being exposed to the nondevotees by My mystic curtain. The less intelligent fools are therefore unaware of My eternal form, which is never to be vanquished and is unborn.\u201d In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said that those who are envious and always angry at the Lord are unfit to know the actual and eternal form of the Lord. In the Bh\u0101gavatam also it is said that the Lord appeared like a thunderbolt to those who were wrestlers. \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la, at the time of being killed by the Lord, could not see Him as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being dazzled by the glare of the brahmajyoti. Therefore, the temporary manifestation of the Lord as a thunderbolt to the wrestlers appointed by Ka\u1e41sa, or the glaring appearance of the Lord before \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la, was relinquished by the Lord, but the Lord as a magician is eternally existent and is never vanquished in any circumstance. Such forms are temporarily shown to the asuras only, and when such exhibitions are withdrawn, the asuras think that the Lord is no more existent, just as the foolish audience thinks the magician to be burnt to ashes or cut to pieces. The conclusion is that the Lord has no material body, and therefore He is never to be killed or changed by His transcendental body."

So he wisely prepared himself to leave home, and he dressed accordingly.",
        "purport": " The present age is influenced by the specific qualities of Kali. Since the days of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, about five thousand years ago, the influence of the Age of Kali began manifesting, and from authentic scriptures it is learned that the Age of Kali is still to run on for 427,000 years. The symptoms of the Kali-yuga, as mentioned above, namely avarice, falsehood, diplomacy, cheating, nepotism, violence and all such things, are already in vogue, and no one can imagine what is going to happen gradually with further increase of the influence of Kali till the day of annihilation. We have already come to know that the influence of the Age of Kali is meant for godless so-called civilized man; those who are under the protection of the Lord have nothing to fear from this horrible age. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was a great devotee of the Lord, and there was no necessity of his being afraid of the Age of Kali, but he preferred to retire from active household life and prepare himself to go back home, back to Godhead. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are eternal companions of the Lord, and therefore they are more interested in the company of the Lord than anything else. Besides that, being an ideal king, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira wanted to retire just to set an example for others. As soon as there is some young fellow to look after the household affairs, one should at once retire from family life to uplift oneself to spiritual realization. One should not rot in the dark well of household life till one is dragged out by the will of Yamar\u0101ja. Modern politicians should take lessons from Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira about voluntary retirement from active life and should make room for the younger generation. Also retired old gentlemen should take lessons from him and leave home for spiritual realization before being forcefully dragged away to meet death."

Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira trained his grandson, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, who was equally qualified, in state administration in terms of the king\u2019s obligation to the citizens. Thus Par\u012bk\u1e63it was enthroned on the seat of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira prior to his departure back to Godhead. Concerning Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, the specific word used, vinayinam, is significant. Why was the King of Hastin\u0101pura, at least till the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, accepted as the Emperor of the world? The only reason is that the people of the world were happy because of the good administration of the emperor. The happiness of the citizens was due to the ample production of natural produce such as grains, fruits, milk, herbs, valuable stones, minerals and everything that the people needed. They were even free from all bodily miseries, anxieties of mind, and disturbances caused by natural phenomena and other living beings. Because everyone was happy in all respects, there was no resentment, although there were sometimes battles between the state kings for political reasons and supremacy. Everyone was trained to attain the highest goal of life, and therefore the people were also enlightened enough not to quarrel over trivialities. The influence of the Age of Kali gradually infiltrated the good qualities of both the kings and the citizens, and therefore a tense situation developed between the ruler and the ruled, but still even in this age of disparity between the ruler and the ruled, there can be spiritual emolument and God consciousness. That is a special prerogative."

Everyone\u2019s life must be so arranged that the last stage of life, say at least the last fifteen to twenty years prior to death, can be absolutely devoted to the devotional service of the Lord to attain the highest perfection of life. It is really foolishness to engage oneself all the days of one\u2019s life in material enjoyment and fruitive activities, because as long as the mind remains absorbed in fruitive work for material enjoyment, there is no chance of getting out from conditioned life, or material bondage. No one should follow the suicidal policy of neglecting one\u2019s supreme task of attaining the highest perfection of life, namely going back home, back to Godhead."

People are generally attached to various kinds of designations \u2014 the designations of family, society, country, occupation, wealth, position and many others. As long as one is attached to such designations, he is considered materially impure. The so-called leaders of men in the modern age are attached by national consciousness, but they do not know that such false consciousness is also another designation of the materially conditioned soul; one has to relinquish such designations before one can become eligible to go back to Godhead. Foolish people adore such men who die in national consciousness, but here is an example of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, a royal king who prepared himself to leave this world without such national consciousness.

There was no longer a need for material activities. Actually the activities of the mind cannot be stopped, for they are the reflection of the eternal soul, but the quality of the activities can be changed from matter to the transcendental service of the Lord. The material color of the mind is changed when one washes it clean of the contaminations of life-breathing and thereby frees it from the contamination of repeated births and deaths and situates it in pure spiritual life. All is manifested by the temporary embodiment of the material body, which is a production of the mind at the time of death, and if the mind is purified by practice of transcendental loving service to the Lord and is constantly engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, there is no more chance of the mind\u2019s producing another material body after death.

But the living entity is different from such material products. It is due to the living entity\u2019s forgetfulness of his eternal nature as eternal servitor of the Lord, and his false conception of being a so-called lord of the material nature, that he is obliged to enter into the existence of false sense enjoyment. Thus a concomitant generation of material energies is the principal cause of the mind\u2019s being materially affected. Thus the gross body of five elements is produced. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira reversed the action and merged the five elements of the body in the three modes of material nature. The qualitative distinction of the body as being good, bad or mediocre is extinguished, and again the qualitative manifestations become merged in the material energy, which is produced from a false sense of the pure living being. When one is thus inclined to become an associate of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, in one of the innumerable planets of the spiritual sky, especially in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, one has to think always that he is different from the material energy; he has nothing to do with it, and he has to realize himself as pure spirit, Brahman, qualitatively equal with the Supreme Brahman (Parame\u015bvara). Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, after distributing his kingdom to Par\u012bk\u1e63it and Vajra, did not think himself Emperor of the world or head of the Kuru dynasty. This sense of freedom from material relations, as well as freedom from the material encagement of the gross and subtle encirclement, makes one free to act as the servitor of the Lord, even though one is in the material world. This stage is called the j\u012bvan-mukta stage, or the liberated stage, even in the material world. That is the process of ending material existence. One must not only think that he is Brahman, but must act like Brahman. One who only thinks himself Brahman is an impersonalist. And one who acts like Brahman is the pure devotee."

We have discussed many times before that the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, as it was strictly followed by the inhabitants of the world, specifically by those who inhabited the \u0100ry\u0101varta province of the world, emphasizes the importance of leaving all household connections at a certain stage of life. The training and education was so imparted, and thus a respectable person like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira had to leave all family connection for self-realization and going back to Godhead. No king or respectable gentleman would continue family life till the end, because that was considered suicidal and against the interest of the perfection of human life. In order to be free from all family encumbrances and devote oneself cent percent in the devotional service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, this system is always recommended for everyone because it is the path of authority. The Lord instructs in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.62) that one must become a devotee of the Lord at least at the last stage of one\u2019s life. A sincere soul of the Lord like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira must abide by this instruction of the Lord for his own interest. The specific words brahma param indicate Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is corroborated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.13) by Arjuna with reference to great authorities like Asita, Devala, N\u0101rada and Vy\u0101sa. Thus Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, while leaving home for the north, constantly remembered Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within himself, following in the footsteps of his forefathers as well as the great devotees of all times."

According to the principles of san\u0101tana-dharma, one must retire from family life after half the duration of life is finished and must engage himself in self-realization. But the question of engaging oneself is not always decided. Sometimes retired men are bewildered about how to engage themselves for the last days of life. Here is a decision by authorities like the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. All of them engaged themselves in favorably culturing the devotional service of the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Sv\u0101m\u012b \u015ar\u012bdhara, dharma, artha, k\u0101ma and mok\u1e63a, or fruitive activities, philosophical speculations and salvation, as conceived by several persons, are not the ultimate goal of life. They are more or less practiced by persons who have no information of the ultimate goal of life. The ultimate goal of life is already indicated by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.64), and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were intelligent enough to follow it without hesitation."

        "translation": "Vidura, while on pilgrimage, left his body at Prabh\u0101sa. Because he was absorbed in thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he was received by the denizens of the Pit\u1e5bloka planet, where he returned to his original post.",
        "purport": " The difference between the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and Vidura is that the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are eternal associates of the Lord, the Personality of Godhead, whereas Vidura is one of the administrative demigods in charge of the Pit\u1e5bloka planet and is known as Yamar\u0101ja. Men are afraid of Yamar\u0101ja because it is he only who awards punishment to the miscreants of the material world, but those who are devotees of the Lord have nothing to fear from him. To the devotees he is a cordial friend, but to the nondevotees he is fear personified. As we have already discussed, it is understood that Yamar\u0101ja was cursed by Ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bka Muni to be degraded as a \u015b\u016bdra, and therefore Vidura was an incarnation of Yamar\u0101ja. As an eternal servitor of the Lord, he displayed his devotional activities very ardently and lived a life of a pious man, so much so that a materialistic man like Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra also got salvation by his instruction. So by his pious activities in the devotional service of the Lord he was able to always remember the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus he became washed of all contamination of a \u015b\u016bdra-born life. At the end he was again received by the denizens of Pit\u1e5bloka and posted in his original position. The demigods are also associates of the Lord without personal touch, whereas the direct associates of the Lord are in constant personal touch with Him. The Lord and His personal associates incarnate in many universes without cessation. The Lord remembers them all, whereas the associates forget due to their being very minute parts and parcels of the Lord; they are apt to forget such incidents due to being infinitesimal. This is corroborated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.5)."

        "purport": " When flying an airplane, one cannot take care of other planes. Everyone has to take care of his own plane, and if there is any danger, no other plane can help another in that condition. Similarly, at the end of life, when one has to go back home, back to Godhead, everyone has to take care of himself without help rendered by another. The help is, however, offered on the ground before flying in space. Similarly, the spiritual master, the father, the mother, the relatives, the husband and others can all render help during one\u2019s lifetime, but while crossing the sea one has to take care of himself and utilize the instructions formerly received. Draupad\u012b had five husbands, and no one asked Draupad\u012b to come; Draupad\u012b had to take care of herself without waiting for her great husbands. And because she was already trained, she at once took to concentration upon the lotus feet of Lord V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. The wives also got the same result as their husbands, in the same manner; that is to say, without changing their bodies they reached the destination of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura suggests that both Draupad\u012b and Subhadr\u0101, although her name is not mentioned herein, got the same result.
