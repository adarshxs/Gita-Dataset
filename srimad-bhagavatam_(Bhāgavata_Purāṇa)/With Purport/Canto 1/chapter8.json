        "purport": " The stringent laws of nature, under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot be altered by any living entity. The living entities are eternally under the subjugation of the almighty Lord. The Lord makes all the laws and orders, and these laws and orders are generally called dharma or religion. No one can create any religious formula. Bona fide religion is to abide by the orders of the Lord. The Lord\u2019s orders are clearly declared in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Everyone should follow Him only or His orders, and that will make all happy, both materially and spiritually. As long as we are in the material world, our duty is to follow the orders of the Lord, and if by the grace of the Lord we are liberated from the clutches of the material world, then in our liberated stage also we can render transcendental loving service unto the Lord. In our material stage we can see neither ourselves nor the Lord for want of spiritual vision. But when we are liberated from material affection and are situated in our original spiritual form we can see both ourselves and the Lord face to face. Mukti means to be reinstated in one\u2019s original spiritual status after giving up the material conception of life. Therefore, human life is specifically meant for qualifying ourselves for this spiritual liberty. Unfortunately, under the influence of illusory material energy, we accept this spot-life of only a few years as our permanent existence and thus become illusioned by possessing so-called country, home, land, children, wife, community, wealth, etc., which are false representations created by m\u0101y\u0101 (illusion). And under the dictation of m\u0101y\u0101, we fight with one another to protect these false possessions. By cultivating spiritual knowledge, we can realize that we have nothing to do with all this material paraphernalia. Then at once we become free from material attachment. This clearance of the misgivings of material existence at once takes place by association with the Lord\u2019s devotees, who are able to inject the transcendental sound into the depths of the bewildered heart and thus make one practically liberated from all lamentation and illusion. That is a summary of the pacifying measures for those affected by the reaction of stringent material laws, exhibited in the forms of birth, death, old age and disease, which are insoluble factors of material existence. The victims of war, namely the family members of the Kurus, were lamenting the problems of death, and the Lord pacified them on the basis of knowledge."

        "purport": " In the glorious days, or before the advent of the Age of Kali, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the cows, the women, the children and the old men were properly given protection. 1. The protection of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as maintains the institution of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama, the most scientific culture for attainment of spiritual life. 2. The protection of cows maintains the most miraculous form of food, i.e., milk, for maintaining the finer tissues of the brain for understanding higher aims of life. 3. The protection of women maintains the chastity of society, by which we can get a good generation for peace, tranquillity and progress of life. 4. The protection of children gives the human form of life its best chance to prepare the way of liberty from material bondage. Such protection of children begins from the very day of begetting a child by the purificatory process of garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, the beginning of pure life. 5. The protection of the old men gives them a chance to prepare themselves for better life after death. This complete outlook is based on factors leading to successful humanity as against the civilization of polished cats and dogs. The killing of the above-mentioned innocent creatures is totally forbidden because even by insulting them one loses one\u2019s duration of life. In the Age of Kali they are not properly protected, and therefore the duration of life of the present generation has shortened considerably. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated that when the women become unchaste for want of proper protection, there are unwanted children called var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara. To insult a chaste woman means to bring about disaster in the duration of life. Du\u1e25\u015b\u0101sana, a brother of Duryodhana, insulted Draupad\u012b, an ideal chaste lady, and therefore the miscreants died untimely. These are some of the stringent laws of the Lord mentioned above."

        "purport": " This is something like the preface to the performances of a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1a by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. The comparison of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to the King of heaven is significant. The King of heaven is thousands and thousands of times greater than Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira in opulence, yet the fame of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was not less. The reason is that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was a pure devotee of the Lord, and by His grace only was King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira on the level of the King of heaven, even though he performed only three yaj\u00f1as whereas the King of heaven performed hundreds. That is the prerogative of the devotee of the Lord. The Lord is equal to everyone, but a devotee of the Lord is more glorified because he is always in touch with the all-great. The sun rays are equally distributed, but still there are some places which are always dark. This is not due to the sun but to the receptive power. Similarly, those who are cent-percent devotees of the Lord get the full-fledged mercy of the Lord, which is always equally distributed everywhere."

Therefore the brahm\u0101stra, more effective and finer than the atomic weapons, was not as blind as the atomic bombs. When the atomic bombs are discharged they do not discriminate between the target and others. Mainly the atomic bombs do harm to the innocent because there is no control. The brahm\u0101stra is not like that. It marks out the target and proceeds accordingly without harming the innocent."

        "purport": " The brahm\u0101stra, the supreme weapon released by A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101, was something similar to the nuclear weapon but with more radiation and heat. This brahm\u0101stra is the product of a more subtle science, being the product of a finer sound, a mantra recorded in the Vedas. Another advantage of this weapon is that it is not blind like the nuclear weapon because it can be directed only to the target and nothing else. A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 released the weapon just to finish all the male members of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du\u2019s family; therefore in one sense it was more dangerous than the atomic bombs because it could penetrate even the most protected place and would never miss the target. Knowing all this, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at once took up His personal weapon to protect His devotees, who did not know anyone other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord has clearly promised that His devotees are never to be vanquished. And He behaves according to the quality or degree of the devotional service rendered by the devotees. Here the word ananya-vi\u1e63ay\u0101tman\u0101m is significant. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were cent-percent dependent on the protection of the Lord, although they were all great warriors themselves. But the Lord neglects even the greatest warriors and also vanquishes them in no time. When the Lord saw that there was no time for the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas to counteract the brahm\u0101stra of A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101, He took up His weapon even at the risk of breaking His own vow. Although the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was almost finished, still, according to His vow, He should not have taken up His own weapon. But the emergency was more important than the vow. He is better known as the bhakta-vatsala, or the lover of His devotee, and thus He preferred to continue as bhakta-vatsala than to be a worldly moralist who never breaks his solemn vow."

You are existing both within and without everything, yet You are invisible to all.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Kunt\u012bdev\u012b was quite aware that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Personality of Godhead, although He was playing the part of her nephew. Such an enlightened lady could not commit a mistake by offering obeisances unto her nephew. Therefore, she addressed Him as the original puru\u1e63a beyond the material cosmos. Although all living entities are also transcendental, they are neither original nor infallible. The living entities are apt to fall down under the clutches of material nature, but the Lord is never like that. In the Vedas, therefore, He is described as the chief among all living entities (nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m). Then again He is addressed as \u012b\u015bvara, or the controller. The living entities or the demigods like Candra and S\u016brya are also to some extent \u012b\u015bvara, but none of them is the supreme \u012b\u015bvara, or the ultimate controller. He is the parame\u015bvara, or the Supersoul. He is both within and without. Although He was present before \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Kunt\u012b as her nephew, He was also within her and everyone else. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15) the Lord says, \u201cI am situated in everyone\u2019s heart, and only due to Me one remembers, forgets and is cognizant, etc. Through all the Vedas I am to be known because I am the compiler of the Vedas, and I am the teacher of the Ved\u0101nta.\u201d Queen Kunt\u012b affirms that the Lord, although both within and without all living beings, is still invisible. The Lord is, so to speak, a puzzle for the common man. Queen Kunt\u012b experienced personally that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present before her, yet He entered within the womb of Uttar\u0101 to save her embryo from the attack of A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101\u2019s brahm\u0101stra. Kunt\u012b herself was puzzled about whether \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all-pervasive or localized. In fact, He is both, but He reserves the right of not being exposed to persons who are not surrendered souls. This checking curtain is called the m\u0101y\u0101 energy of the Supreme Lord, and it controls the limited vision of the rebellious soul. It is explained as follows."

        "purport": " In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a affirms that less intelligent persons mistake Him to be an ordinary man like us, and thus they deride Him. The same is confirmed herein by Queen Kunt\u012b. The less intelligent persons are those who rebel against the authority of the Lord. Such persons are known as asuras. The asuras cannot recognize the Lord\u2019s authority. When the Lord Himself appears amongst us, as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha or in His original form as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He performs many wonderful acts which are humanly impossible. As we shall find in the Tenth Canto of this great literature, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibited His humanly impossible activities even from the days of His lying on the lap of His mother. He killed the P\u016btan\u0101 witch, although she smeared her breast with poison just to kill the Lord. The Lord sucked her breast like a natural baby, and He sucked out her very life also. Similarly, He lifted the Govardhana Hill, just as a boy picks up a frog\u2019s umbrella, and stood several days continuously just to give protection to the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. These are some of the superhuman activities of the Lord described in the authoritative Vedic literatures like the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, Itih\u0101sas (histories) and Upani\u1e63ads. He has delivered wonderful instructions in the shape of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. He has shown marvelous capacities as a hero, as a householder, as a teacher and as a renouncer. He is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by such authoritative personalities as Vy\u0101sa, Devala, Asita, N\u0101rada, Madhva, \u015aa\u1e45kara, R\u0101m\u0101nuja, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b and all other authorities of the line. He Himself has declared as much in many places of the authentic literatures. And yet there is a class of men with demoniac mentality who are always reluctant to accept the Lord as the Supreme Absolute Truth. This is partially due to their poor fund of knowledge and partially due to their stubborn obstinacy, which results from various misdeeds in the past and present. Such persons could not recognize Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a even when He was present before them. Another difficulty is that those who depend more on their imperfect senses cannot realize Him as the Supreme Lord. Such persons are like the modern scientist. They want to know everything by their experimental knowledge. But it is not possible to know the Supreme Person by imperfect experimental knowledge. He is described herein as adhok\u1e63aja, or beyond the range of experimental knowledge. All our senses are imperfect. We claim to observe everything and anything, but we must admit that we can observe things under certain material conditions only, which are also beyond our control. The Lord is beyond the observation of sense perception. Queen Kunt\u012b accepts this deficiency of the conditioned soul, especially of the woman class, who are less intelligent. For less intelligent men there must be such things as temples, mosques or churches so that they may begin to recognize the authority of the Lord and hear about Him from authorities in such holy places. For less intelligent men, this beginning of spiritual life is essential, and only foolish men decry the establishment of such places of worship, which are required to raise the standard of spiritual attributes for the mass of people. For less intelligent persons, bowing down before the authority of the Lord, as generally done in the temples, mosques or churches, is as beneficial as it is for the advanced devotees to meditate upon Him by active service."

It is said in the Upani\u1e63ads that the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, is beyond the range of the thinking power of the greatest philosopher. He is unknowable by great learning or by the greatest brain. He is knowable only by one who has His mercy. Others may go on thinking about Him for years together, yet He is unknowable. This very fact is corroborated by the Queen, who is playing the part of an innocent woman. Women in general are unable to speculate like philosophers, but they are blessed by the Lord because they believe at once in the superiority and almightiness of the Lord, and thus they offer obeisances without reservation. The Lord is so kind that He does not show special favor only to one who is a great philosopher. He knows the sincerity of purpose. For this reason only, women generally assemble in great number in any sort of religious function. In every country and in every sect of religion it appears that the women are more interested than the men. This simplicity of acceptance of the Lord\u2019s authority is more effective than showy insincere religious fervor."

        "purport": " The Lord, being thus unapproachable by any material assets, out of unbounded and causeless mercy descends to the earth as He is in order to show His special mercy upon His unalloyed devotees and to diminish the upsurges of the demoniac persons. Queen Kunt\u012b specifically adores the incarnation or descent of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a above all other incarnations because in this particular incarnation He is more approachable. In the R\u0101ma incarnation He remained a king\u2019s son from His very childhood, but in the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although He was the son of a king, He at once left the shelter of His real father and mother (King Vasudeva and Queen Devak\u012b) just after His appearance and went to the lap of Ya\u015bod\u0101m\u0101y\u012b to play the part of an ordinary cowherd boy in the blessed Vrajabh\u016bmi, which is very sanctified because of His childhood pastimes. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is more merciful than Lord R\u0101ma. He was undoubtedly very kind to Kunt\u012b\u2019s brother Vasudeva and the family. Had He not become the son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, Queen Kunt\u012b could not claim Him to be her nephew and thus address K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in parental affection. But Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101 are more fortunate because they could relish the Lord\u2019s childhood pastimes, which are more attractive than all other pastimes. There is no parallel to His childhood pastimes as exhibited at Vrajabh\u016bmi, which are replicas of His eternal affairs in the original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, described as the cint\u0101ma\u1e47i-dh\u0101ma in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descended Himself at Vrajabh\u016bmi with all His transcendental entourage and paraphernalia. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore confirmed that no one is as fortunate as the residents of Vrajabh\u016bmi, and specifically the cowherd girls, who dedicated their everything for the satisfaction of the Lord. His pastimes with Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101 and His pastimes with the cowherd men and especially with the cowherd boys and the cows have caused Him to be known as Govinda. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Govinda is more inclined to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the cows, indicating thereby that human prosperity depends more on these two items, namely brahminical culture and cow protection. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is never satisfied where these are lacking."

This is claimed because women, \u015b\u016bdras (the laborer class) and the dvija-bandhus, or the wretched descendants of the higher three classes, are unfit by intelligence to understand transcendental subject matter concerning the spiritual name, fame, attributes, forms, etc., of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such persons, although they are unfit to enter into the spiritual affairs of the Lord, can see Him as the arc\u0101-vigraha, who descends to the material world just to distribute favors to the fallen souls, including the above-mentioned women, \u015b\u016bdras and dvija-bandhus. Because such fallen souls cannot see anything beyond matter, the Lord condescends to enter into each and every one of the innumerable universes as the Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who grows a lotus stem from the lotuslike depression in the center of His transcendental abdomen, and thus Brahm\u0101, the first living being in the universe, is born. Therefore, the Lord is known as the Pa\u1e45kajan\u0101bhi. The Pa\u1e45kajan\u0101bhi Lord accepts the arc\u0101-vigraha (His transcendental form) in different elements, namely a form within the mind, a form made of wood, a form made of earth, a form made of metal, a form made of jewel, a form made of paint, a form drawn on sand, etc. All such forms of the Lord are always decorated with garlands of lotus flowers, and there should be a soothing atmosphere in the temple of worship to attract the burning attention of the nondevotees always engaged in material wranglings. The meditators worship a form within the mind. Therefore, the Lord is merciful even to the women, \u015b\u016bdras and dvija-bandhus, provided they agree to visit the temple of worship in different forms made for them. Such temple visitors are not idolaters, as alleged by some men with a poor fund of knowledge. All the great \u0101c\u0101ryas established such temples of worship in all places just to favor the less intelligent, and one should not pose himself as transcending the stage of temple worship while one is actually in the category of the \u015b\u016bdras and the women or less. One should begin to see the Lord from His lotus feet, gradually rising to the thighs, waist, chest and face. One should not try to look at the face of the Lord without being accustomed to seeing the lotus feet of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Kunt\u012b, because of her being the aunt of the Lord, did not begin to see the Lord from the lotus feet because the Lord might feel ashamed, and thus Kunt\u012bdev\u012b, just to save a painful situation for the Lord, began to see the Lord just above His lotus feet, i.e., from the waist of the Lord, gradually rising to the face, and then down to the lotus feet. In the round, everything there is in order."

        "purport": " Devak\u012b, the mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and sister of King Ka\u1e41sa, was put into prison along with her husband, Vasudeva, because the envious King was afraid of being killed by Devak\u012b\u2019s eighth son (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a). He killed all the sons of Devak\u012b who were born before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a escaped the danger of child-slaughter because He was transferred to the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s foster father. Kunt\u012bdev\u012b, along with her children, was also saved from a series of dangers. But Kunt\u012bdev\u012b was shown far more favor because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not save the other children of Devak\u012b, whereas He saved the children of Kunt\u012bdev\u012b. This was done because Devak\u012b\u2019s husband, Vasudeva, was living, whereas Kunt\u012bdev\u012b was a widow, and there was none to help her except K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The conclusion is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a endows more favor to a devotee who is in greater dangers. Sometimes He puts His pure devotees in such dangers because in that condition of helplessness the devotee becomes more attached to the Lord. The more the attachment is there for the Lord, the more success is there for the devotee."

They were put into trouble by Duryodhana and his party due to the kingdom, and each and every time the sons of Kunt\u012b were saved by the Lord.

The Lord saved Draupad\u012b by supplying an immeasurable length of cloth, and Duryodhana\u2019s party failed to see her naked.

Constantly remembering the lotus feet of the Lord means preparing for liberation from birth and death. Therefore, even though there are so-called calamities, they are welcome because they give us an opportunity to remember the Lord, which means liberation. One who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, which are accepted as the most suitable boat for crossing the ocean of nescience, can achieve liberation as easily as one leaps over the holes made by the hoofs of a calf. Such persons are meant to reside in the abode of the Lord, and they have nothing to do with a place where there is danger in every step. This material world is certified by the Lord in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as a dangerous place full of calamities. Less intelligent persons prepare plans to adjust to those calamities without knowing that the nature of this place is itself full of calamities. They have no information of the abode of the Lord, which is full of bliss and without trace of calamity. The duty of the sane person, therefore, is to be undisturbed by worldly calamities, which are sure to happen in all circumstances. Suffering all sorts of unavoidable misfortunes, one should make progress in spiritual realization because that is the mission of human life. The spirit soul is transcendental to all material calamities; therefore, the so-called calamities are called false. A man may see a tiger swallowing him in a dream, and he may cry for this calamity. Actually there is no tiger and there is no suffering; it is simply a case of dreams. In the same way, all calamities of life are said to be dreams. If someone is lucky enough to get in contact with the Lord by devotional service, it is all gain. Contact with the Lord by any one of the nine devotional services is always a forward step on the path going back to Godhead."

One who is on the path of [material] progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great opulence, high education and bodily beauty, cannot approach You with sincere feeling.",
        "purport": " Being materially advanced means taking birth in an aristocratic family and possessing great wealth, an education and attractive personal beauty. All materialistic men are mad after possessing all these material opulences, and this is known as the advancement of material civilization. But the result is that by possessing all these material assets one becomes artificially puffed up, intoxicated by such temporary possessions. Consequently, such materially puffed up persons are incapable of uttering the holy name of the Lord by addressing Him feelingly, \u201cO Govinda, O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d It is said in the \u015b\u0101stras that by once uttering the holy name of the Lord, the sinner gets rid of a quantity of sins that he is unable to commit. Such is the power of uttering the holy name of the Lord. There is not the least exaggeration in this statement. Actually the Lord\u2019s holy name has such powerful potency. But there is a quality to such utterances also. It depends on the quality of feeling. A helpless man can feelingly utter the holy name of the Lord, whereas a man who utters the same holy name in great material satisfaction cannot be so sincere. A materially puffed up person may utter the holy name of the Lord occasionally, but he is incapable of uttering the name in quality. Therefore, the four principles of material advancement, namely (1) high parentage, (2) good wealth, (3) high education and (4) attractive beauty, are, so to speak, disqualifications for progress on the path of spiritual advancement. The material covering of the pure spirit soul is an external feature, as much as fever is an external feature of the unhealthy body. The general process is to decrease the degree of the fever and not to aggravate it by maltreatment. Sometimes it is seen that spiritually advanced persons become materially impoverished. This is no discouragement. On the other hand, such impoverishment is a good sign as much as the falling of temperature is a good sign. The principle of life should be to decrease the degree of material intoxication which leads one to be more and more illusioned about the aim of life. Grossly illusioned persons are quite unfit for entrance into the kingdom of God."

        "translation": "My obeisances are unto You, who are the property of the materially impoverished. You have nothing to do with the actions and reactions of the material modes of nature. You are self-satisfied, and therefore You are the most gentle and are master of the monists.",
        "purport": " A living being is finished as soon as there is nothing to possess. Therefore a living being cannot be, in the real sense of the term, a renouncer. A living being renounces something for gaining something more valuable. A student sacrifices his childish proclivities to gain better education. A servant gives up his job for a better job. Similarly, a devotee renounces the material world not for nothing but for something tangible in spiritual value. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b and \u015ar\u012bla Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and others gave up their worldly pomp and prosperity for the sake of the service of the Lord. They were big men in the worldly sense. The Gosv\u0101m\u012bs were ministers in the government service of Bengal, and \u015ar\u012bla Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b was the son of a big zamindar of his time. But they left everything to gain something superior to what they previously possessed. The devotees are generally without material prosperity, but they have a very secret treasure-house in the lotus feet of the Lord. There is a nice story about \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b. He had a touchstone, and this stone was left in a pile of refuse. A needy man took it, but later on wondered why the valuable stone was kept in such a neglected place. He therefore asked San\u0101tana for the most valuable thing, and then he was given the holy name of the Lord. Aki\u00f1cana means one who has nothing to give materially. A factual devotee, or mah\u0101tm\u0101, does not give anything material to anyone because he has already left all material assets. He can, however, deliver the supreme asset, namely the Personality of Godhead, because He is the only property of a factual devotee. The touchstone of San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, which was thrown in the rubbish, was not the property of the Gosv\u0101m\u012b, otherwise it would not have been kept in such a place. This specific example is given for the neophyte devotees just to convince them that material hankerings and spiritual advancement go ill together. Unless one is able to see everything as spiritual in relation with the Supreme Lord, one must always distinguish between spirit and matter. A spiritual master like \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, although personally able to see everything as spiritual, set this example for us only because we have no such spiritual vision. Advancement of material vision or material civilization is a great stumbling block for spiritual advancement. Such material advancement entangles the living being in the bondage of a material body followed by all sorts of material miseries. Such material advancement is called anartha, or things not wanted. Actually this is so. In the present context of material advancement one uses lipstick at a cost of fifty cents, and there are so many unwanted things which are all products of the material conception of life. By diverting attention to so many unwanted things, human energy is spoiled without achievement of spiritual realization, the prime necessity of human life. The attempt to reach the moon is another example of spoiling energy because even if the moon is reached, the problems of life will not be solved. The devotees of the Lord are called aki\u00f1canas because they have practically no material assets. Such material assets are all products of the three modes of material nature. They foil spiritual energy, and thus the less we possess such products of material nature, the more we have a good chance for spiritual progress. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no direct connection with material activities. All His acts and deeds, which are exhibited even in this material world, are spiritual and without affection for the modes of material nature. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that all His acts, even His appearance and disappearance in and out of the material world, are transcendental, and one who knows this perfectly shall not take his birth again in this material world, but will go back to Godhead. The material disease is due to hankering after and lording it over material nature. This hankering is due to an interaction of the three modes of nature, and neither the Lord nor the devotees have attachment for such false enjoyment. Therefore, the Lord and the devotees are called niv\u1e5btta-gu\u1e47a-v\u1e5btti. The perfect niv\u1e5btta-gu\u1e47a-v\u1e5btti is the Supreme Lord because He never becomes attracted by the modes of material nature, whereas the living beings have such a tendency. Some of them are entrapped by the illusory attraction of material nature. Because the Lord is the property of the devotees, and the devotees are the property of the Lord reciprocally, the devotees are certainly transcendental to the modes of material nature. That is a natural conclusion. Such unalloyed devotees are distinct from the mixed devotees who approach the Lord for mitigation of miseries and poverty or because of inquisitiveness and speculation. The unalloyed devotees and the Lord are transcendentally attached to one another. For others, the Lord has nothing to reciprocate, and therefore He is called \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma, self-satisfied. Self-satisfied as He is, He is the master of all monists who seek to merge into the existence of the Lord. Such monists merge within the personal effulgence of the Lord called the brahmajyoti, but the devotees enter into the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, which are never to be misunderstood as material."

She knew perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the primeval Lord who lives in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul, Param\u0101tm\u0101. Another name of the Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature of the Lord is k\u0101la, or eternal time. Eternal time is the witness of all our actions, good and bad, and thus resultant reactions are destined by Him. It is no use saying that we do not know why and for what we are suffering. We may forget the misdeed for which we may suffer at this present moment, but we must remember that Param\u0101tm\u0101 is our constant companion, and therefore He knows everything, past, present and future. And because the Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a destines all actions and reactions, He is the supreme controller also. Without His sanction not a blade of grass can move. The living beings are given as much freedom as they deserve, and misuse of that freedom is the cause of suffering. The devotees of the Lord do not misuse their freedom, and therefore they are the good sons of the Lord. Others, who misuse freedom, are put into miseries destined by the eternal k\u0101la. The k\u0101la offers the conditioned souls both happiness and miseries. It is all predestined by eternal time. As we have miseries uncalled-for, so we may have happiness also without being asked, for they are all predestined by k\u0101la. No one is therefore either an enemy or friend of the Lord. Everyone is suffering and enjoying the result of his own destiny. This destiny is made by the living beings in course of social intercourse. Everyone here wants to lord it over the material nature, and thus everyone creates his own destiny under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. He is all-pervading and therefore He can see everyone\u2019s activities. And because the Lord has no beginning or end, He is known also as the eternal time, k\u0101la."

        "purport": " The Lord\u2019s mercy upon the fallen souls is equally distributed. He has no one as the specific object of hostility. The very conception of the Personality of Godhead as a human being is misleading. His pastimes appear to be exactly like a human being\u2019s, but actually they are transcendental and without any tinge of material contamination. He is undoubtedly known as partial to His pure devotees, but in fact He is never partial, as much as the sun is never partial to anyone. By utilizing the sun rays, sometimes even the stones become valuable, whereas a blind man cannot see the sun, although there are enough sun rays before him. Darkness and light are two opposite conceptions, but this does not mean that the sun is partial in distributing its rays. The sun rays are open to everyone, but the capacities of the receptacles differ. Foolish people think that devotional service is flattering the Lord to get special mercy. Factually the pure devotees who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are not a mercantile community. A mercantile house renders service to someone in exchange for values. The pure devotee does not render service unto the Lord for such exchange, and therefore the full mercy of the Lord is open for him. Suffering men, needy men, inquisitive persons, or philosophers make temporary connections with the Lord to serve a particular purpose. When the purpose is served, there is no more relation with the Lord. A suffering man, if he is pious at all, prays to the Lord for his recovery. But as soon as the recovery is over, in most cases the suffering man no longer cares to keep any connection with the Lord. The mercy of the Lord is open for him, but he is reluctant to receive it. That is the difference between a pure devotee and a mixed devotee. Those who are completely against the service of the Lord are considered to be in abject darkness, those who ask for the Lord\u2019s favor only at the time of necessity are partial recipients of the mercy of the Lord, and those who are cent-percent engaged in the service of the Lord are full recipients of the mercy of the Lord. Such partiality in receiving the Lord\u2019s mercy is relative to the recipient, and it is not due to the partiality of the all-merciful Lord. When the Lord descends to this material world by His all-merciful energy, He plays like a human being, and therefore it appears that the Lord is partial to His devotees only, but that is not a fact. Despite such apparent manifestation of partiality, His mercy is equally distributed. In the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra all persons who died in the fight before the presence of the Lord got salvation without the necessary qualifications because death before the presence of the Lord purifies the passing soul from the effects of all sins, and therefore the dying man gets a place somewhere in the transcendental abode. Somehow or other if someone puts himself open in the sun rays, he is sure to get the requisite benefit both by heat and by ultraviolet rays. Therefore, the conclusion is that the Lord is never partial. It is wrong for the people in general to think of Him as partial."

        "translation": "My dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Ya\u015bod\u0101 took up a rope to bind You when You committed an offense, and Your perturbed eyes overflooded with tears, which washed the mascara from Your eyes. And You were afraid, though fear personified is afraid of You. This sight is bewildering to me.",
        "purport": " Here is another explanation of the bewilderment created by the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the Supreme in all circumstances, as already explained. Here is a specific example of the Lord\u2019s being the Supreme and at the same time a plaything in the presence of His pure devotee. The Lord\u2019s pure devotee renders service unto the Lord out of unalloyed love only, and while discharging such devotional service the pure devotee forgets the position of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord also accepts the loving service of His devotees more relishably when the service is rendered spontaneously out of pure affection, without anything of reverential admiration. Generally the Lord is worshiped by the devotees in a reverential attitude, but the Lord is meticulously pleased when the devotee, out of pure affection and love, considers the Lord to be less important than himself. The Lord\u2019s pastimes in the original abode of Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are exchanged in that spirit. The friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consider Him one of them. They do not consider Him to be of reverential importance. The parents of the Lord (who are all pure devotees) consider Him a child only. The Lord accepts the chastisements of the parents more cheerfully than the prayers of the Vedic hymns. Similarly, He accepts the reproaches of His fiancees more palatably than the Vedic hymns. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present in this material world to manifest His eternal pastimes of the transcendental realm of Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as an attraction for the people in general, He displayed a unique picture of subordination before His foster mother, Ya\u015bod\u0101. The Lord, in His naturally childish playful activities, used to spoil the stocked butter of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 by breaking the pots and distributing the contents to His friends and playmates, including the celebrated monkeys of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, who took advantage of the Lord\u2019s munificence. Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 saw this, and out of her pure love she wanted to make a show of punishment for her transcendental child. She took a rope and threatened the Lord that she would tie Him up, as is generally done in the ordinary household. Seeing the rope in the hands of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, the Lord bowed down His head and began to weep just like a child, and tears rolled down His cheeks, washing off the black ointment smeared about His beautiful eyes. This picture of the Lord is adored by Kunt\u012bdev\u012b because she is conscious of the Lord\u2019s supreme position. He is feared often by fear personified, yet He is afraid of His mother, who wanted to punish Him just in an ordinary manner. Kunt\u012b was conscious of the exalted position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas Ya\u015bod\u0101 was not. Therefore Ya\u015bod\u0101\u2019s position was more exalted than Kunt\u012b\u2019s. Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 got the Lord as her child, and the Lord made her forget altogether that her child was the Lord Himself. If mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 had been conscious of the exalted position of the Lord, she would certainly have hesitated to punish the Lord. But she was made to forget this situation because the Lord wanted to make a complete gesture of childishness before the affectionate Ya\u015bod\u0101. This exchange of love between the mother and the son was performed in a natural way, and Kunt\u012b, remembering the scene, was bewildered, and she could do nothing but praise the transcendental maternal love. Indirectly mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 is praised for her unique position of love, for she could control even the all-powerful Lord as her beloved child."

        "purport": " Because the Lord\u2019s appearance in this material world is bewildering, there are different opinions about the birth of the Unborn. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that He takes His birth in the material world, although He is the Lord of all creations and He is unborn. So there cannot be any denial of the birth of the Unborn because He Himself establishes the truth. But still there are different opinions as to why He takes His birth. That is also declared in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. He appears by His own internal potency to reestablish the principles of religion and to protect the pious and to annihilate the impious. That is the mission of the appearance of the Unborn. Still, it is said that the Lord is there to glorify the pious King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a certainly wanted to establish the kingdom of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas for the good of all in the world. When there is a pious king ruling over the world, the people are happy. When the ruler is impious, the people are unhappy. In the Age of Kali in most cases the rulers are impious, and therefore the citizens are also continuously unhappy. But in the case of democracy, the impious citizens themselves elect their representative to rule over them, and therefore they cannot blame anyone for their unhappiness. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nala was also celebrated as a great pious king, but he had no connection with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira is meant here to be glorified by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord had already glorified King Yadu, having taken birth in his family. Although He is known as Y\u0101dava, Yaduv\u012bra, Yadunandana, etc., He is always independent of such obligation. He is just like the sandalwood that grows in the Malaya hills. Trees can grow anywhere and everywhere, yet because the sandalwood trees grow mostly in the area of the Malaya hills, the name sandalwood and the Malaya hills are interrelated. Therefore, the conclusion is that the Lord is ever unborn like the sun, and yet He appears as the sun rises on the eastern horizon. As the sun is never the sun of the eastern horizon, so the Lord is no one\u2019s son, but He is the father of everything that be."

        "purport": " Brahm\u0101, or the first living being born just after the creation, is the direct son of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, first of all entered the material universe. Without spiritual contact, matter cannot create. This principle was followed from the very beginning of the creation. The Supreme Spirit entered the universe, and the first living being, Brahm\u0101, was born on a lotus flower grown out of the transcendental abdomen of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is therefore known as Padman\u0101bha. Brahm\u0101 is known as \u0101tma-bh\u016b because he was begotten directly from the father without any contact of mother Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b. Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b was present near N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, engaged in the service of the Lord, and still, without contact with Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a begot Brahm\u0101. That is the omnipotency of the Lord. One who foolishly considers N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a like other living beings should take a lesson from this. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is not an ordinary living being. He is the Personality of Godhead Himself, and He has all the potencies of all the senses in all parts of His transcendental body. An ordinary living being begets a child by sexual intercourse, and he has no other means to beget a child other than the one designed for him. But N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, being omnipotent, is not bound to any condition of energy. He is complete and independent to do anything and everything by His various potencies, very easily and perfectly. Brahm\u0101 is therefore directly the son of the father and was not put into the womb of a mother. Therefore he is known as \u0101tma-bh\u016b. This Brahm\u0101 is in charge of further creations in the universe, secondarily reflected by the potency of the Omnipotent. Within the halo of the universe there is a transcendental planet known as \u015avetadv\u012bpa, which is the abode of the K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature of the Supreme Lord. Whenever there is trouble in the universe that cannot be solved by the administrative demigods, they approach Brahm\u0101j\u012b for a solution, and if it is not to be solved even by Brahm\u0101j\u012b, then Brahm\u0101j\u012b consults and prays to the K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u for an incarnation and solution to the problems. Such a problem arose when Ka\u1e41sa and others were ruling over the earth and the earth became too much overburdened by the misdeeds of the asuras. Brahm\u0101j\u012b, along with other demigods, prayed at the shore of the K\u1e63\u012brodaka Ocean, and they were advised of the descent of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b. So some people say that the Lord appeared because of the prayers of Brahm\u0101j\u012b."

The way of religion is made by the Supreme Lord. No one can manufacture a new path of religion, as is the fashion for certain ambitious persons. The factual way of religion is to accept the Lord as the supreme authority and thus render service unto Him in spontaneous love. A living being cannot help but render service because he is constitutionally made for that purpose. The only function of the living being is to render service to the Lord. The Lord is great, and living beings are subordinate to Him. Therefore, the duty of the living being is just to serve Him only. Unfortunately the illusioned living beings, out of misunderstanding only, become servants of the senses by material desire. This desire is called avidy\u0101, or nescience. And out of such desire the living being makes different plans for material enjoyment centered about a perverted sex life. He therefore becomes entangled in the chain of birth and death by transmigrating into different bodies on different planets under the direction of the Supreme Lord. Unless, therefore, one is beyond the boundary of this nescience, one cannot get free from the threefold miseries of material life. That is the law of nature. The Lord, however, out of His causeless mercy, because He is more merciful to the suffering living beings than they can expect, appears before them and renovates the principles of devotional service comprised of hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, cooperating and surrendering unto Him. Adoption of all the above-mentioned items, or any one of them, can help a conditioned soul get out of the tangle of nescience and thus become liberated from all material sufferings created by the living being illusioned by the external energy. This particular type of mercy is bestowed upon the living being by the Lord in the form of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu."

        "purport": " The Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be seen by our present conditional vision. In order to see Him, one has to change his present vision by developing a different condition of life full of spontaneous love of Godhead. When \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was personally present on the face of the globe, not everyone could see Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Materialists like R\u0101va\u1e47a, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, Ka\u1e41sa, Jar\u0101sandha and \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la were highly qualified personalities by acquisition of material assets, but they were unable to appreciate the presence of the Lord. Therefore, even though the Lord may be present before our eyes, it is not possible to see Him unless we have the necessary vision. This necessary qualification is developed by the process of devotional service only, beginning with hearing about the Lord from the right sources. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is one of the popular literatures which are generally heard, chanted, repeated, etc., by the people in general, but in spite of such hearing, etc., sometimes it is experienced that the performer of such devotional service does not see the Lord face to face. The reason is that the first item, \u015brava\u1e47a, is very important. If hearing is from the right sources, it acts very quickly. Generally people hear from unauthorized persons. Such unauthorized persons may be very learned by academic qualifications, but because they do not follow the principles of devotional service, hearing from them becomes a sheer waste of time. Sometimes the texts are interpreted fashionably to suit their own purposes. Therefore, first one should select a competent and bona fide speaker and then hear from him. When the hearing process is perfect and complete, the other processes become automatically perfect in their own way. There are different transcendental activities of the Lord, and each and every one of them is competent to bestow the desired result, provided the hearing process is perfect. In the Bh\u0101gavatam the activities of the Lord begin from His dealings with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. There are many other pastimes of the Lord in connection with His dealings with the asuras and others. And in the Tenth Canto the sublime dealings with His conjugal associates, the gop\u012bs, as well as with His married wives at Dv\u0101rak\u0101 are mentioned. Since the Lord is absolute, there is no difference in the transcendental nature of each and every dealing of the Lord. But sometimes people, in an unauthorized hearing process, take more interest in hearing about His dealings with the gop\u012bs. Such an inclination indicates the lusty feelings of the hearer, so a bona fide speaker of the dealings of the Lord never indulges in such hearings. One must hear about the Lord from the very beginning, as in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam or any other scriptures, and that will help the hearer attain perfection by progressive development. One should not, therefore, consider that His dealings with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are less important than His dealings with the gop\u012bs. We must always remember that the Lord is always transcendental to all mundane attachment. In all the above-mentioned dealings of the Lord, He is the hero in all circumstances, and hearing about Him or about His devotees or combatants is conducive to spiritual life. It is said that the Vedas and Pur\u0101\u1e47as, etc., are all made to revive our lost relation with Him. Hearing of all these scriptures is essential."

        "translation": "O my Lord, You have executed all duties Yourself. Are you leaving us today, though we are completely dependent on Your mercy and have no one else to protect us, now when all kings are at enmity with us?",
        "purport": " The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are most fortunate because with all good luck they were entirely dependent on the mercy of the Lord. In the material world, to be dependent on the mercy of someone else is the utmost sign of misfortune, but in the case of our transcendental relation with the Lord, it is the most fortunate case when we can live completely dependent on Him. The material disease is due to thinking of becoming independent of everything. But the cruel material nature does not allow us to become independent. The false attempt to become independent of the stringent laws of nature is known as material advancement of experimental knowledge. The whole material world is moving on this false attempt of becoming independent of the laws of nature. Beginning from R\u0101va\u1e47a, who wanted to prepare a direct staircase to the planets of heaven, down to the present age, they are trying to overcome the laws of nature. They are trying now to approach distant planetary systems by electronic mechanical power. But the highest goal of human civilization is to work hard under the guidance of the Lord and become completely dependent on Him. The highest achievement of perfect civilization is to work with valor but at the same time depend completely on the Lord. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were the ideal executors of this standard of civilization. Undoubtedly they were completely dependent on the good will of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but they were not idle parasites of the Lord. They were all highly qualified both by personal character and by physical activities. Still they always looked for the mercy of the Lord because they knew that every living being is dependent by constitutional position. The perfection of life is, therefore, to become dependent on the will of the Lord, instead of becoming falsely independent in the material world. Those who try to become falsely independent of the Lord are called an\u0101tha, or without any guardian, whereas those who are completely dependent on the will of the Lord are called san\u0101tha, or those having someone to protect them. Therefore we must try to be san\u0101tha so that we can always be protected from the unfavorable condition of material existence. By the deluding power of the external material nature we forget that the material condition of life is the most undesirable perplexity. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 therefore directs us (7.19) that after many, many births one fortunate person becomes aware of the fact that V\u0101sudeva is all in all and that the best way of leading one\u2019s life is to surrender unto Him completely. That is the sign of a mah\u0101tm\u0101. All the members of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava family were mah\u0101tm\u0101s in household life. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was the head of these mah\u0101tm\u0101s, and Queen Kunt\u012bdev\u012b was the mother. The lessons of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and all the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, specifically the Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a, are therefore inevitably connected with the history of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava mah\u0101tm\u0101s. For them, separation from the Lord was just like the separation of a fish from water. \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Kunt\u012bdev\u012b, therefore, felt such separation like a thunderbolt, and the whole prayer of the Queen is to try to persuade the Lord to stay with them. After the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, although the inimical kings were killed, their sons and grandsons were still there to deal with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. It is not only the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas who were put into the condition of enmity, but all of us are always in such a condition, and the best way of living is to become completely dependent on the will of the Lord and thereby overcome all difficulties of material existence."

        "purport": " Human prosperity flourishes by natural gifts and not by gigantic industrial enterprises. The gigantic industrial enterprises are products of a godless civilization, and they cause the destruction of the noble aims of human life. The more we go on increasing such troublesome industries to squeeze out the vital energy of the human being, the more there will be unrest and dissatisfaction of the people in general, although a few only can live lavishly by exploitation. The natural gifts such as grains and vegetables, fruits, rivers, the hills of jewels and minerals, and the seas full of pearls are supplied by the order of the Supreme, and as He desires, material nature produces them in abundance or restricts them at times. The natural law is that the human being may take advantage of these godly gifts by nature and satisfactorily flourish on them without being captivated by the exploitative motive of lording it over material nature. The more we attempt to exploit material nature according to our whims of enjoyment, the more we shall become entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. If we have sufficient grains, fruits, vegetables and herbs, then what is the necessity of running a slaughterhouse and killing poor animals? A man need not kill an animal if he has sufficient grains and vegetables to eat. The flow of river waters fertilizes the fields, and there is more than what we need. Minerals are produced in the hills, and the jewels in the ocean. If the human civilization has sufficient grains, minerals, jewels, water, milk, etc., then why should it hanker after terrible industrial enterprises at the cost of the labor of some unfortunate men? But all these natural gifts are dependent on the mercy of the Lord. What we need, therefore, is to be obedient to the laws of the Lord and achieve the perfection of human life by devotional service. The indications by Kunt\u012bdev\u012b are just to the point. She desires that God\u2019s mercy be bestowed upon them so that natural prosperity be maintained by His grace."

        "purport": " A pure devotee of the Lord is ashamed to ask anything in self-interest from the Lord. But the householders are sometimes obliged to ask favors from the Lord, being bound by the tie of family affection. \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Kunt\u012bdev\u012b was conscious of this fact, and therefore she prayed to the Lord to cut off the affectionate tie from her own kinsmen, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are her own sons, and the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is are the members of her paternal family. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was equally related to both the families. Both the families required the Lord\u2019s help because both were dependent devotees of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Kunt\u012bdev\u012b wished \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to remain with her sons the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, but by His doing so her paternal house would be bereft of the benefit. All these partialities troubled the mind of Kunt\u012b, and therefore she desired to cut off the affectionate tie. A pure devotee cuts off the limited ties of affection for his family and widens his activities of devotional service for all forgotten souls. The typical example is the band of Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, who followed the path of Lord Caitanya. All of them belonged to the most enlightened and cultured rich families of the higher castes, but for the benefit of the mass of population they left their comfortable homes and became mendicants. To cut off all family affection means to broaden the field of activities. Without doing this, no one can be qualified as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a king, a public leader or a devotee of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead, as an ideal king, showed this by example. \u015ar\u012b R\u0101macandra cut off the tie of affection for His beloved wife to manifest the qualities of an ideal king. Such personalities as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a devotee, a king or a public leader must be very broad-minded in discharging their respective duties. \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Kunt\u012bdev\u012b was conscious of this fact, and being weak she prayed to be free from such bondage of family affection. The Lord is addressed as the Lord of the universe, or the Lord of the universal mind, indicating His all-powerful ability to cut the hard knot of family affection. Therefore, it is sometimes experienced that the Lord, out of His special affinity towards a weak devotee, breaks the family affection by force of circumstances arranged by His all-powerful energy. By doing so He causes the devotee to become completely dependent on Him and thus clears the path for his going back to Godhead."

        "purport": " Perfection of pure devotional service is attained when all attention is diverted towards the transcendental loving service of the Lord. To cut off the tie of all other affections does not mean complete negation of the finer elements, like affection for someone else. This is not possible. A living being, whoever he may be, must have this feeling of affection for others because this is a symptom of life. The symptoms of life, such as desire, anger, hankerings, feelings of attraction, etc., cannot be annihilated. Only the objective has to be changed. Desire cannot be negated, but in devotional service the desire is changed only for the service of the Lord in place of desire for sense gratification. The so-called affection for family, society, country, etc., consists of different phases of sense gratification. When this desire is changed for the satisfaction of the Lord, it is called devotional service. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can see that Arjuna desired not to fight with his brothers and relations just to satisfy his own personal desires. But when he heard the message of the Lord, \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, he changed his decision and served the Lord. And for his doing so, he became a famous devotee of the Lord, for it is declared in all the scriptures that Arjuna attained spiritual perfection by devotional service to the Lord in friendship. The fighting was there, the friendship was there, Arjuna was there, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was there, but Arjuna became a different person by devotional service. Therefore, the prayers of Kunt\u012b also indicate the same categorical changes in activities. \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Kunt\u012b wanted to serve the Lord without diversion, and that was her prayer. This unalloyed devotion is the ultimate goal of life. Our attention is usually diverted to the service of something which is nongodly or not in the program of the Lord. When the program is changed into the service of the Lord, that is to say when the senses are purified in relation with the service of the Lord, it is called pure unalloyed devotional service. \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Kunt\u012bdev\u012b wanted that perfection and prayed for it from the Lord. Her affection for the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is is not out of the range of devotional service because the service of the Lord and the service of the devotees are identical. Sometimes service to the devotee is more valuable than service to the Lord. But here the affection of Kunt\u012bdev\u012b for the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is was due to family relation. This tie of affection in terms of material relation is the relation of m\u0101y\u0101 because the relations of the body or the mind are due to the influence of the external energy. Relations of the soul, established in relation with the Supreme Soul, are factual relations. When Kunt\u012bdev\u012b wanted to cut off the family relation, she meant to cut off the relation of the skin. The skin relation is the cause of material bondage, but the relation of the soul is the cause of freedom. This relation of the soul to the soul can be established by the medium of the relation with the Supersoul. Seeing in the darkness is not seeing. But seeing by the light of the sun means to see the sun and everything else which was unseen in the darkness. That is the way of devotional service."

        "purport": " The pious King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was mortified because of the mass massacre of human beings in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, especially on his account. Duryodhana was there on the throne, and he was doing well in his administration, and in one sense there was no need of fighting. But on the principle of justice Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was to replace him. The whole clique of politics centered around this point, and all the kings and residents of the whole world became involved in this fight between the rival brothers. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was also there on the side of King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. It is said in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, \u0100di-parva (2.25) that 640,000,000 men were killed in the eighteen days of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and some hundreds of thousands were missing. Practically this was the greatest battle in the world within five thousand years. This mass killing simply to enthrone Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was too mortifying, so he tried to be convinced with evidences from histories by great sages like Vy\u0101sa and the Lord Himself that the fight was just because the cause was just. But Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira would not be satisfied, even though he was instructed by the greatest personalities of the time. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is designated herein as the performer of superhuman actions, but in this particular instance neither He nor Vy\u0101sa could convince King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Does it mean that He failed to be a superhuman actor? No, certainly not. The interpretation is that the Lord as \u012b\u015bvara, or the Supersoul in the hearts of both King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and Vy\u0101sa, performed still more superhuman action because the Lord desired it. As Supersoul of King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, He did not allow the King to be convinced by the words of Vy\u0101sa and others, including Himself, because He desired that the King hear instructions from the dying Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, who was another great devotee of the Lord. The Lord wanted that at the last stage of his material existence the great warrior Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva see Him personally and see his beloved grandchildren, King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, etc., now situated on the throne, and thus pass away very peacefully. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was not at all satisfied to fight against the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were his beloved fatherless grandchildren. But the k\u1e63atriyas are also very stern people, and therefore he was obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because he was maintained at the expense of Duryodhana. Besides this, the Lord also desired that King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira be pacified by the words of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva so that the world could see that Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva excelled all in knowledge, including the Lord Himself."

A k\u1e63atriya is bound to fight for the right cause, regardless of the opposite party. In such discharge of duty, one should not be disturbed by annihilation of the material body, which is only an external dress of the living soul. All this was perfectly known to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, but by the will of the Lord he became just like a common man because there was another great idea behind this delusion: the King would be instructed by Bh\u012b\u1e63ma as Arjuna was instructed by the Lord Himself."

        "purport": " The g\u1e5bhamedh\u012bs are those whose only business is to perform welfare work for the sake of material prosperity. Such material prosperity is sometimes hampered by sinful activities, for the materialist is sure to commit sins, even unintentionally, in the course of discharging material duties. To get relief from such sinful reactions, the Vedas prescribe several kinds of sacrifices. It is said in the Vedas that by performing the a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1a (horse sacrifice) one can get relief from even brahma-haty\u0101 (killing of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a). Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira Mah\u0101r\u0101ja performed this a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1a, but he thinks that even by performing such yaj\u00f1as it is not possible to get relief from the great sins committed. In war either the husband or the brother or even the father or sons go to fight. And when they are killed, a fresh enmity is created, and thus a chain of actions and reactions increases which is not possible to be counteracted even by thousands of a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1as. The way of work (karma) is like that. It creates one action and another reaction simultaneously and thus increases the chain of material activities, binding the performer in material bondage. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.27-28) the remedy is suggested that such actions and reactions of the path of work can be checked only when work is done on behalf of the Supreme Lord. The Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was actually fought by the will of the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as it is evident from His version, and only by His will was Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira placed on the throne of Hastin\u0101pura. Therefore, factually no sin whatsoever touched the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were only the order carriers of the Lord. For others, who declare war out of personal interest, the whole responsibility lies on them."

        "purport": " A\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1as or gomedha-yaj\u00f1as, sacrifices in which a horse or a bull is sacrificed, were not, of course, for the purpose of killing the animals. Lord Caitanya said that such animals sacrificed on the altar of yaj\u00f1a were rejuvenated and a new life was given to them. It was just to prove the efficacy of the hymns of the Vedas. By recitation of the hymns of the Vedas in the proper way, certainly the performer gets relief from the reactions of sins, but in case of such sacrifices improperly done under inexpert management, surely one has to become responsible for animal sacrifice. In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy there is no possibility of performing the yaj\u00f1as perfectly for want of expert br\u0101hma\u1e47as who are able to conduct such yaj\u00f1as. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira therefore gives a hint to performing sacrifices in the Age of Kali. In the Kali-yuga the only sacrifice recommended is the performance of hari-n\u0101ma-yaj\u00f1a inaugurated by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. But one should not indulge in animal killing and counteract it by performing the hari-n\u0101ma-yaj\u00f1a. Those who are devotees of the Lord never kill an animal for self-interest, and (as the Lord ordered Arjuna) they do not refrain from performing the duty of a k\u1e63atriya. The whole purpose, therefore, is served when everything is done for the will of the Lord. This is possible only for the devotees."
