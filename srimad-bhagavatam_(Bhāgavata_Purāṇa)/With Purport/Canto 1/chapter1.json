I meditate upon Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahm\u0101j\u012b, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.",
        "purport": " Obeisances unto the Personality of Godhead V\u0101sudeva directly indicate Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the divine son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b. This fact will be more explicitly explained in the text of this work. \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva asserts herein that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Personality of Godhead, and all others are His direct or indirect plenary portions or portions of the portion. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has even more explicitly explained the subject matter in his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sandarbha. And Brahm\u0101, the original living being, has explained the subject of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a substantially in his treatise named Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. In an Upani\u1e63ad in the S\u0101ma-veda, it is also stated that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the divine son of Devak\u012b. Therefore, in this prayer, the first proposition holds that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the primeval Lord, and if any transcendental nomenclature is to be understood as belonging to the Absolute Personality of Godhead, it must be the name indicated by the word K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which means the all-attractive. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, in many places, the Lord asserts Himself to be the original Personality of Godhead, and this is confirmed by Arjuna, and also by great sages like N\u0101rada, Vy\u0101sa, and many others. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, it is also stated that out of the innumerable names of the Lord, the name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the principal one. V\u0101sudeva indicates the plenary portion of the Personality of Godhead, and all the different forms of the Lord, being identical with V\u0101sudeva, are indicated in this text. The name V\u0101sudeva particularly indicates the divine son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always meditated upon by the paramaha\u1e41sas, who are the perfected ones among those in the renounced order of life. V\u0101sudeva, or Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the cause of all causes. Everything that exists emanates from the Lord. How this is so is explained in later chapters of this work. This work is described by Mah\u0101prabhu \u015ar\u012b Caitanya as the spotless Pur\u0101\u1e47a because it contains the transcendental narration of the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The history of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is also very glorious. It was compiled by \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva after he had attained maturity in transcendental knowledge. He wrote this under the instructions of \u015ar\u012b N\u0101radaj\u012b, his spiritual master. Vy\u0101sadeva compiled all Vedic literatures, containing the four divisions of the Vedas, the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras (or the Brahma-s\u016btras), the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and so on. But nevertheless he was not satisfied. His dissatisfaction was observed by his spiritual master, and thus N\u0101rada advised him to write on the transcendental activities of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These transcendental activities are described specifically in the Tenth Canto of this work. But, in order to reach to the very substance, one must proceed gradually by developing knowledge of the categories. It is natural that a philosophical mind wants to know about the origin of the creation. At night he sees the stars in the sky, and he naturally speculates about their inhabitants. Such inquiries are natural for man because man has a developed consciousness which is higher than that of the animals. The author of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam gives a direct answer to such inquiries. He says that the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all creations. He is not only the creator of the universe, but the destroyer as well. The manifested cosmic nature is created at a certain period by the will of the Lord. It is maintained for some time, and then it is annihilated by His will. Therefore, the supreme will is behind all cosmic activities. Of course, there are atheists of various categories who do not believe in a creator, but that is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The modern scientist, for example, has created space satellites, and by some arrangement or other, these satellites are thrown into outer space to fly for some time at the control of the scientist who is far away. Similarly, all the universes with innumerable stars and planets are controlled by the intelligence of the Personality of Godhead. In Vedic literatures, it is said that the Absolute Truth, Personality of Godhead, is the chief amongst all living personalities. All living beings, beginning from the first created being, Brahm\u0101, down to the smallest ant, are individual living beings. And above Brahm\u0101, there are even other living beings with individual capacities, and the Personality of Godhead is also a similar living being. And He is an individual as are the other living beings. But the Supreme Lord, or the supreme living being, has the greatest intelligence, and He possesses supermost inconceivable energies of all different varieties. If a man\u2019s brain can produce a space satellite, one can very easily imagine how brains higher than man can produce similarly wonderful things which are far superior. The reasonable person will easily accept this argument, but there are stubborn atheists who would never agree. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva, however, at once accepts the supreme intelligence as the parame\u015bvara. He offers his respectful obeisances unto the supreme intelligence addressed as the para or the parame\u015bvara or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And that parame\u015bvara is \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as admitted in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and other scriptures delivered by \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva and specifically in this \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that there is no other para-tattva (summum bonum) than Himself. Therefore, \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva at once worships the para-tattva, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whose transcendental activities are described in the Tenth Canto. Unscrupulous persons go immediately to the Tenth Canto and especially to the five chapters which describe the Lord\u2019s r\u0101sa dance. This portion of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the most confidential part of this great literature. Unless one is thoroughly accomplished in the transcendental knowledge of the Lord, one is sure to misunderstand the Lord\u2019s worshipable transcendental pastimes called r\u0101sa dance and His love affairs with the gop\u012bs. This subject matter is highly spiritual, and only the liberated persons who have gradually attained to the stage of paramaha\u1e41sa can transcendentally relish this r\u0101sa dance. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva therefore gives the reader the chance to gradually develop spiritual realization before actually relishing the essence of the pastimes of the Lord. Therefore, he purposely invokes a G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra, dh\u012bmahi. This G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people. When one is successful in chanting the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must therefore acquire brahminical qualities or be perfectly situated in the quality of goodness in order to chant the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra successfully and then attain to the stage of transcendentally realizing the Lord, His name, His fame, His qualities and so on. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the narration of the svar\u016bpa of the Lord manifested by His internal potency, and this potency is distinguished from the external potency which has manifested the cosmic world, which is within our experience. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva makes a clear distinction between the two in this \u015bloka. \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva says herein that the manifested internal potency is real, whereas the external manifested energy in the form of material existence is only temporary and illusory like the mirage in the desert. In the desert mirage there is no actual water. There is only the appearance of water. Real water is somewhere else. The manifested cosmic creation appears as reality. But reality, of which this is but a shadow, is in the spiritual world. Absolute Truth is in the spiritual sky, not the material sky. In the material sky everything is relative truth. That is to say, one truth depends on something else. This cosmic creation results from interaction of the three modes of nature, and the temporary manifestations are so created as to present an illusion of reality to the bewildered mind of the conditioned soul, who appears in so many species of life, including the higher demigods, like Brahm\u0101, Indra, Candra, and so on. In actuality, there is no reality in the manifested world. There appears to be reality, however, because of the true reality which exists in the spiritual world, where the Personality of Godhead eternally exists with His transcendental paraphernalia. The chief engineer of a complicated construction does not personally take part in the construction, but he knows every nook and corner because everything is done under his direction. He knows everything about the construction, both directly and indirectly. Similarly, the Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme engineer of this cosmic creation, knows every nook and corner, although affairs are being carried out by demigods. Beginning from Brahm\u0101 down to the insignificant ant, no one is independent in the material creation. The hand of the Lord is seen everywhere. All material elements as well as all spiritual sparks emanate from Him only. And whatever is created in this material world is but the interaction of two energies, the material and the spiritual, which emanate from the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A chemist can manufacture water in the chemical laboratory by mixing hydrogen and oxygen. But, in reality, the living entity works in the laboratory under the direction of the Supreme Lord. And the materials with which he works are also supplied by the Lord. The Lord knows everything directly and indirectly, and He is cognizant of all minute details, and He is fully independent. He is compared to a mine of gold, and the cosmic creations in so many different forms are compared to objects made from the gold, such as gold rings, necklaces and so on. The gold ring and the gold necklace are qualitatively one with the gold in the mine, but quantitatively the gold in the mine is different. Therefore, the Absolute Truth is simultaneously one and different. Nothing is absolutely equal with the Absolute Truth, but at the same time, nothing is independent of the Absolute Truth. Conditioned souls, beginning from Brahm\u0101, who engineers the entire universe, down to the insignificant ant, are all creating, but none of them is independent of the Supreme Lord. The materialist wrongly thinks that there is no creator other than his own self. This is called m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion. Because of his poor fund of knowledge, the materialist cannot see beyond the purview of his imperfect senses, and thus he thinks that matter automatically takes its own shape without the aid of a superior intelligence. This is refuted in this \u015bloka by \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva: \u201cSince the complete whole or the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, nothing can be independent of the body of the Absolute Truth.\u201d Whatever happens to the body quickly becomes known to the embodied. Similarly, the creation is the body of the absolute whole. Therefore, the Absolute knows everything directly and indirectly that happens in the creation. In the \u015bruti-mantra, it is also stated that the absolute whole or Brahman is the ultimate source of everything. Everything emanates from Him, and everything is maintained by Him. And at the end, everything enters into Him. That is the law of nature. In the sm\u1e5bti-mantra, the same is confirmed. It is said that the source from which everything emanates at the beginning of Brahm\u0101\u2019s millennium, and the reservoir to which everything ultimately enters, is the Absolute Truth, or Brahman. Material scientists take it for granted that the ultimate source of the planetary system is the sun, but they are unable to explain the source of the sun. Herein, the ultimate source is explained. According to the Vedic literatures, Brahm\u0101, who may be compared to the sun, is not the ultimate creator. It is stated in this \u015bloka that Brahm\u0101 was taught Vedic knowledge by the Personality of Godhead. One may argue that Brahm\u0101, being the original living being, could not be inspired because there was no other being living at that time. Herein it is stated that the Supreme Lord inspired the secondary creator, Brahm\u0101, in order that Brahm\u0101 could carry out his creative functions. So, the supreme intelligence behind all creations is the Absolute Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states that it is He only who superintends the creative energy, prak\u1e5bti, which constitutes the totality of matter. Therefore, \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva does not worship Brahm\u0101, but the Supreme Lord, who guides Brahm\u0101 in his creative activities. In this \u015bloka, the particular words abhij\u00f1a\u1e25 and svar\u0101\u1e6d are significant. These two words distinguish the Supreme Lord from all the other living entities. No other living entity is either abhij\u00f1a\u1e25 or svar\u0101\u1e6d. That is, no one is either fully cognizant or fully independent. Even Brahm\u0101 has to meditate upon the Supreme Lord in order to create. Then what to speak of great scientists like Einstein! The brains of such a scientist are certainly not the products of any human being. Scientists cannot manufacture such a brain, and what to speak of foolish atheists who defy the authority of the Lord? Even M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b impersonalists who flatter themselves that they can become one with the Lord are neither abhij\u00f1a\u1e25 nor svar\u0101\u1e6d. Such impersonalists undergo severe austerities to acquire knowledge to become one with the Lord. But ultimately they become dependent on some rich disciple who supplies them with money to build monasteries and temples. Atheists like R\u0101va\u1e47a or Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu had to undergo severe penances before they could flout the authority of the Lord. But ultimately, they were rendered helpless and could not save themselves when the Lord appeared before them as cruel death. This is also the case with the modern atheists who also dare to flout the authority of the Lord. Such atheists will be dealt with similarly, for history repeats itself. Whenever men neglect the authority of the Lord, nature and her laws are there to penalize them. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (Bg. 4.7) in the well-known verse yad\u0101 yad\u0101 hi dharmasya gl\u0101ni\u1e25. \u201cWhenever there is a decline of dharma and a rise of adharma, O Arjuna, then I incarnate Myself.\u201d That the Supreme Lord is all-perfect is confirmed in all \u015bruti-mantras. It is said in the \u015bruti-mantras that the all-perfect Lord threw a glance over matter and thus created all living beings. The living beings are parts and parcels of the Lord, and He impregnates the vast material creation with seeds of spiritual sparks, and thus the creative energies are set in motion to enact so many wonderful creations. An atheist may argue that God is no more expert than a watchmaker, but of course God is greater because He can create machines in duplicate male and female forms. The male and female forms of different types of machineries go on producing innumerable similar machines without God\u2019s further attention. If a man could manufacture such a set of machines that could produce other machines without his attention, then he could approach the intelligence of God. But that is not possible, for each machine has to be handled individually. Therefore, no one can create as well as God. Another name for God is asamordhva, which means that no one is equal to or greater than Him. Para\u1e41 satyam, or the Supreme Truth, is He who has no equal or superior. This is confirmed in the \u015bruti-mantras. It is said that before the creation of the material universe there existed the Lord only, who is master of everyone. That Lord instructed Brahm\u0101 in Vedic knowledge. That Lord has to be obeyed in all respects. Anyone who wants to get rid of the material entanglement must surrender unto Him. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Unless one surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, it is certain that he will be bewildered. When an intelligent man surrenders unto the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and knows completely that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the cause of all causes, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, then only can such an intelligent man become a mah\u0101tm\u0101, or great soul. But such a great soul is rarely seen. Only the mah\u0101tm\u0101s can understand that the Supreme Lord is the primeval cause of all creations. He is parama or ultimate truth because all other truths are relative to Him. He is omniscient. For Him, there is no illusion. Some M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b scholars argue that \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was not compiled by \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva. And some of them suggest that this book is a modern creation written by someone named Vopadeva. In order to refute such meaningless arguments, \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b points out that there is reference to the Bh\u0101gavatam in many of the oldest Pur\u0101\u1e47as. This first \u015bloka of the Bh\u0101gavatam begins with the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra. There is reference to this in the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a, which is the oldest Pur\u0101\u1e47a. In that Pur\u0101\u1e47a, it is said with reference to the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra in the Bh\u0101gavatam that there are many narrations of spiritual instructions beginning with the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra. And there is the history of V\u1e5btr\u0101sura. Anyone who makes a gift of this great work on a full moon day attains to the highest perfection of life by returning to Godhead. There is reference to the Bh\u0101gavatam in other Pur\u0101\u1e47as also, where it is clearly stated that this work was finished in twelve cantos, which include eighteen thousand \u015blokas. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a also there is reference to the Bh\u0101gavatam in a conversation between Gautama and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. The king was advised therein to read regularly \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam if he desired liberation from material bondage. Under the circumstances, there is no doubt about the authority of the Bh\u0101gavatam. Within the past five hundred years, many erudite scholars and \u0101c\u0101ryas like J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, Vallabh\u0101c\u0101rya, and many other distinguished scholars even after the time of Lord Caitanya made elaborate commentaries on the Bh\u0101gavatam. And the serious student would do well to attempt to go through them to better relish the transcendental messages. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura specifically deals with the original and pure sex psychology (\u0101di-rasa), devoid of all mundane inebriety. The whole material creation is moving under the principle of sex life. In modern civilization, sex life is the focal point for all activities. Wherever one turns his face, he sees sex life predominant. Therefore, sex life is not unreal. Its reality is experienced in the spiritual world. The material sex life is but a perverted reflection of the original fact. The original fact is in the Absolute Truth, and thus the Absolute Truth cannot be impersonal. It is not possible to be impersonal and contain pure sex life. Consequently, the impersonalist philosophers have given indirect impetus to the abominable mundane sex life because they have overstressed the impersonality of the ultimate truth. Consequently, man without information of the actual spiritual form of sex has accepted perverted material sex life as the all in all. There is a distinction between sex life in the diseased material condition and spiritual sex life. This \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam will gradually elevate the unbiased reader to the highest perfectional stage of transcendence. It will enable him to transcend the three modes of material activities: fruitive actions, speculative philosophy, and worship of functional deities as inculcated in Vedic verses."

        "translation": "Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful Bh\u0101gavatam, compiled by the great sage Vy\u0101sadeva [in his maturity], is sufficient in itself for God realization. What is the need of any other scripture? As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of Bh\u0101gavatam, by this culture of knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart.",
        "purport": " Religion includes four primary subjects, namely pious activities, economic development, satisfaction of the senses, and finally liberation from material bondage. Irreligious life is a barbarous condition. Indeed, human life begins when religion begins. Eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating are the four principles of animal life. These are common both to animals and to human beings. But religion is the extra function of the human being. Without religion, human life is no better than animal life. Therefore, in human societies there is some form of religion which aims at self-realization and which makes reference to man\u2019s eternal relationship with God. In the lower stages of human civilization, there is always competition to lord it over the material nature or, in other words, there is a continuous rivalry to satisfy the senses. Driven by such consciousness, man turns to religion. He thus performs pious activities or religious functions in order to gain something material. But if such material gains are obtainable in other ways, then so-called religion is neglected. This is the situation in modern civilization. Man is thriving economically, so at present he is not very interested in religion. Churches, mosques or temples are now practically vacant. Men are more interested in factories, shops, and cinemas than in religious places which were erected by their forefathers. This practically proves that religion is performed for some economic gains. Economic gains are needed for sense gratification. Often when one is baffled in the pursuit of sense gratification, he takes to salvation and tries to become one with the Supreme Lord. Consequently, all these states are simply different types of sense gratification. In the Vedas, the above-mentioned four activities are prescribed in the regulative way so that there will not be any undue competition for sense gratification. But \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is transcendental to all these sense gratificatory activities. It is purely transcendental literature which can be understood only by the pure devotees of the Lord who are transcendental to competitive sense gratification. In the material world there is keen competition between animal and animal, man and man, community and community, nation and nation. But the devotees of the Lord rise above such competitions. They do not compete with the materialist because they are on the path back to Godhead where life is eternal and blissful. Such transcendentalists are nonenvious and pure in heart. In the material world, everyone is envious of everyone else, and therefore there is competition. But the transcendental devotees of the Lord are not only free from material envy, but are well-wishers to everyone, and they strive to establish a competitionless society with God in the center. The contemporary socialist\u2019s conception of a competitionless society is artificial because in the socialist state there is competition for the post of dictator. From the point of view of the Vedas or from the point of view of common human activities, sense gratification is the basis of material life. There are three paths mentioned in the Vedas. One involves fruitive activities to gain promotion to better planets. Another involves worshiping different demigods for promotion to the planets of the demigods, and another involves realizing the Absolute Truth and His impersonal feature and becoming one with Him. The impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth is not the highest. Above the impersonal feature is the Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature, and above this is the personal feature of the Absolute Truth, or Bhagav\u0101n. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam gives information about the Absolute Truth in His personal feature. It is higher than impersonalist literatures and higher than the j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da division of the Vedas. It is even higher than the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da division, and even higher than the up\u0101san\u0101-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da division, because it recommends the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, there is competition to reach heavenly planets for better sense gratification, and there is similar competition in the j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da and the up\u0101san\u0101-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is superior to all of these because it aims at the Supreme Truth, which is the substance or the root of all categories. From \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam one can come to know the substance as well as the categories. The substance is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord, and all emanations are relative forms of energy. Nothing is apart from the substance, but at the same time the energies are different from the substance. This conception is not contradictory. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam explicitly promulgates this simultaneously-one-and-different philosophy of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, which begins with the \u201cjanm\u0101dy asya\u201d s\u016btra. This knowledge that the energy of the Lord is simultaneously one with and different from the Lord is an answer to the mental speculators\u2019 attempt to establish the energy as the Absolute. When this knowledge is factually understood, one sees the conceptions of monism and dualism to be imperfect. Development of this transcendental consciousness grounded in the conception of simultaneously-one-and-different leads one immediately to the stage of freedom from the threefold miseries. The threefold miseries are (1) those miseries which arise from the mind and body, (2) those miseries inflicted by other living beings, and (3) those miseries arising from natural catastrophes over which one has no control. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam begins with the surrender of the devotee unto the Absolute Person. The devotee is fully aware that he is one with the Absolute and at the same time in the eternal position of servant to the Absolute. In the material conception, one falsely thinks himself the lord of all he surveys, and therefore he is always troubled by the threefold miseries of life. But as soon as one comes to know his real position as transcendental servant, he at once becomes free from all miseries. As long as the living entity is trying to master material nature, there is no possibility of his becoming servant of the Supreme. Service to the Lord is rendered in pure consciousness of one\u2019s spiritual identity; by service one is immediately freed from material encumbrances. Over and above this, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is a personal commentation on the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra by \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva. It was written in the maturity of his spiritual life through the mercy of N\u0101rada. \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva is the authorized incarnation of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, there is no question as to his authority. He is the author of all other Vedic literatures, yet he recommends the study of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam above all others. In other Pur\u0101\u1e47as there are different methods set forth by which one can worship the demigods. But in the Bh\u0101gavatam only the Supreme Lord is mentioned. The Supreme Lord is the total body, and the demigods are the different parts of that body. Consequently, by worshiping the Supreme Lord, one does not need to worship the demigods. The Supreme Lord becomes fixed in the heart of the devotee immediately. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has recommended the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as the spotless Pur\u0101\u1e47a and distinguishes it from all other Pur\u0101\u1e47as. The proper method for receiving this transcendental message is to hear it submissively. A challenging attitude cannot help one realize this transcendental message. One particular word is used herein for proper guidance. This word is \u015bu\u015br\u016b\u1e63u. One must be anxious to hear this transcendental message. The desire to sincerely hear is the first qualification. Less fortunate persons are not at all interested in hearing this \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The process is simple, but the application is difficult. Unfortunate people find enough time to hear idle social and political conversations, but when invited to attend a meeting of devotees to hear \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam they suddenly become reluctant. Sometimes professional readers of the Bh\u0101gavatam immediately plunge into the confidential topics of the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, which they seemingly interpret as sex literature. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is meant to be heard from the beginning. Those who are fit to assimilate this work are mentioned in this \u015bloka: \u201cOne becomes qualified to hear \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam after many pious deeds.\u201d The intelligent person, with thoughtful discretion, can be assured by the great sage Vy\u0101sadeva that he can realize the Supreme Personality directly by hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Without undergoing the different stages of realization set forth in the Vedas, one can be lifted immediately to the position of paramaha\u1e41sa simply by agreeing to receive this message."

        "translation": "O expert and thoughtful men, relish \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures. It emanated from the lips of \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls.",
        "purport": " In the two previous \u015blokas it has been definitely proved that the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the sublime literature which surpasses all other Vedic scriptures due to its transcendental qualities. It is transcendental to all mundane activities and mundane knowledge. In this \u015bloka it is stated that \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is not only a superior literature but is the ripened fruit of all Vedic literatures. In other words, it is the cream of all Vedic knowledge. Considering all this, patient and submissive hearing is definitely essential. With great respect and attention, one should receive the message and lessons imparted by the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The Vedas are compared to the desire tree because they contain all things knowable by man. They deal with mundane necessities as well as spiritual realization. The Vedas contain regulative principles of knowledge covering social, political, religious, economic, military, medicinal, chemical, physical and metaphysical subject matter and all that may be necessary to keep the body and soul together. Above and beyond all this are specific directions for spiritual realization. Regulative knowledge involves a gradual raising of the living entity to the spiritual platform, and the highest spiritual realization is knowledge that the Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all spiritual tastes, or rasas. Every living entity, beginning from Brahm\u0101, the first-born living being within the material world, down to the insignificant ant, desires to relish some sort of taste derived from sense perceptions. These sensual pleasures are technically called rasas. Such rasas are of different varieties. In the revealed scriptures the following twelve varieties of rasas are enumerated: (1) raudra (anger), (2) adbhuta (wonder), (3) \u015b\u1e5b\u1e45g\u0101ra (conjugal love), (4) h\u0101sya (comedy), (5) v\u012bra (chivalry), (6) day\u0101 (mercy), (7) d\u0101sya (servitorship), (8) sakhya (fraternity), (9) bhay\u0101naka (horror), (10) b\u012bbhatsa (shock), (11) \u015b\u0101nta (neutrality), (12) v\u0101tsalya (parenthood). The sum total of all these rasas is called affection or love. Primarily, such signs of love are manifested in adoration, service, friendship, parental affection, and conjugal love. And when these five are absent, love is present indirectly in anger, wonder, comedy, chivalry, fear, shock and so on. For example, when a man is in love with a woman, the rasa is called conjugal love. But when such love affairs are disturbed there may be wonder, anger, shock, or even horror. Sometimes love affairs between two persons culminate in ghastly murder scenes. Such rasas are displayed between man and man and between animal and animal. There is no possibility of an exchange or rasa between a man and an animal or between a man and any other species of living beings within the material world. The rasas are exchanged between members of the same species. But as far as the spirit souls are concerned, they are one qualitatively with the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the rasas were originally exchanged between the spiritual living being and the spiritual whole, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The spiritual exchange or rasa is fully exhibited in spiritual existence between living beings and the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is therefore described in the \u015bruti-mantras, Vedic hymns, as \u201cthe fountainhead of all rasas.\u201d When one associates with the Supreme Lord and exchanges one\u2019s constitutional rasa with the Lord, then the living being is actually happy. These \u015bruti-mantras indicate that every living being has its constitutional position, which is endowed with a particular type of rasa to be exchanged with the Personality of Godhead. In the liberated condition only, this primary rasa is experienced in full. In the material existence, the rasa is experienced in the perverted form, which is temporary. And thus the rasas of the material world are exhibited in the material form of raudra (anger) and so on. Therefore, one who attains full knowledge of these different rasas, which are the basic principles of activities, can understand the false representations of the original rasas which are reflected in the material world. The learned scholar seeks to relish the real rasa in the spiritual form. In the beginning he desires to become one with the Supreme. Thus, less intelligent transcendentalists cannot go beyond this conception of becoming one with the spirit whole, without knowing of the different rasas. In this \u015bloka, it is definitely stated that spiritual rasa, which is relished even in the liberated stage, can be experienced in the literature of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam due to its being the ripened fruit of all Vedic knowledge. By submissively hearing this transcendental literature, one can attain the full pleasure of his heart\u2019s desire. But one must be very careful to hear the message from the right source. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is exactly received from the right source. It was brought by N\u0101rada Muni from the spiritual world and given to his disciple \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva. The latter in turn delivered the message to his son \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, and \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b delivered the message to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it just seven days before the King\u2019s death. \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was a liberated soul from his very birth. He was liberated even in the womb of his mother, and he did not undergo any sort of spiritual training after his birth. At birth no one is qualified, neither in the mundane nor in the spiritual sense. But \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, due to his being a perfectly liberated soul, did not have to undergo an evolutionary process for spiritual realization. Yet despite his being a completely liberated person situated in the transcendental position above the three material modes, he was attracted to this transcendental rasa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is adored by liberated souls who sing Vedic hymns. The Supreme Lord\u2019s pastimes are more attractive to liberated souls than to mundane people. He is of necessity not impersonal because it is only possible to carry on transcendental rasa with a person. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam the transcendental pastimes of the Lord are narrated, and the narration is systematically depicted by \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. Thus the subject matter is appealing to all classes of persons, including those who seek liberation and those who seek to become one with the supreme whole. In Sanskrit the parrot is also known as \u015buka. When a ripened fruit is cut by the red beaks of such birds, its sweet flavor is enhanced. The Vedic fruit which is mature and ripe in knowledge is spoken through the lips of \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who is compared to the parrot not for his ability to recite the Bh\u0101gavatam exactly as he heard it from his learned father, but for his ability to present the work in a manner that would appeal to all classes of men. The subject matter is so presented through the lips of \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b that any sincere listener that hears submissively can at once relish transcendental tastes which are distinct from the perverted tastes of the material world. The ripened fruit is not dropped all of a sudden from the highest planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. Rather, it has come down carefully through the chain of disciplic succession without change or disturbance. Foolish people who are not in the transcendental disciplic succession commit great blunders by trying to understand the highest transcendental rasa known as the r\u0101sa dance without following in the footsteps of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who presents this fruit very carefully by stages of transcendental realization. One should be intelligent enough to know the position of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam by considering personalities like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who deals with the subject so carefully. This process of disciplic succession of the Bh\u0101gavata school suggests that in the future also \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam has to be understood from a person who is factually a representative of \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. A professional man who makes a business out of reciting the Bh\u0101gavatam illegally is certainly not a representative of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. Such a man\u2019s business is only to earn his livelihood. Therefore one should refrain from hearing the lectures of such professional men. Such men usually go to the most confidential part of the literature without undergoing the gradual process of understanding this grave subject. They usually plunge into the subject matter of the r\u0101sa dance, which is misunderstood by the foolish class of men. Some of them take this to be immoral, while others try to cover it up by their own stupid interpretations. They have no desire to follow in the footsteps of \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. One should conclude, therefore, that the serious student of the rasa should receive the message of Bh\u0101gavatam in the chain of disciplic succession from \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who describes the Bh\u0101gavatam from its very beginning and not whimsically to satisfy the mundaner who has very little knowledge in transcendental science. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is so carefully presented that a sincere and serious person can at once enjoy the ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge simply by drinking the nectarean juice through the mouth of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b or his bona fide representative."

        "purport": " The prelude of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was spoken in the previous three \u015blokas. Now the main topic of this great literature is being presented. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, after its first recitation by \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, was repeated for the second time at Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya. In the V\u0101yav\u012bya Tantra, it is said that Brahm\u0101, the engineer of this particular universe, contemplated a great wheel which could enclose the universe. The hub of this great circle was fixed at a particular place known as Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya. Similarly, there is another reference to the forest of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya in the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a, where it is stated that by performance of sacrifice at this place, the strength of demoniac people is curtailed. Thus br\u0101hma\u1e47as prefer Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya for such sacrificial performances. The devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u offer all kinds of sacrifices for His pleasure. The devotees are always attached to the service of the Lord, whereas fallen souls are attached to the pleasures of material existence. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, it is said that anything performed in the material world for any reason other than for the pleasure of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u causes further bondage for the performer. It is enjoined therefore that all acts must be performed sacrificially for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and His devotees. This will bring everyone peace and prosperity. The great sages are always anxious to do good to the people in general, and as such the sages headed by \u015aaunaka and others assembled at this holy place of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya with a program of performing a great and continuous chain of sacrificial ceremonies. Forgetful men do not know the right path for peace and prosperity. However, the sages know it well, and therefore for the good of all men they are always anxious to perform acts which may bring about peace in the world. They are sincere friends to all living entities, and at the risk of great personal inconvenience they are always engaged in the service of the Lord for the good of all people. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is just like a great tree, and all others, including the demigods, men, Siddhas, C\u0101ra\u1e47as, Vidy\u0101dharas and other living entities, are like branches, twigs and leaves of that tree. By pouring water on the root of the tree, all the parts of the tree are automatically nourished. Only those branches and leaves which are detached cannot be so satisfied. Detached branches and leaves dry up gradually despite all watering attempts. Similarly, human society, when it is detached from the Personality of Godhead like detached branches and leaves, is not capable of being watered, and one attempting to do so is simply wasting his energy and resources. The modern materialistic society is detached from its relation to the Supreme Lord. And all its plans which are being made by atheistic leaders are sure to be baffled at every step. Yet they do not wake up to this. In this age, the congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord is the prescribed method for waking up. The ways and means are most scientifically presented by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, and intelligent persons may take advantage of His teachings in order to bring about real peace and prosperity. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is also presented for the same purpose, and this will be explained more specifically later in the text."

And all other preceptors are considered to be his representatives. A representative is one who can exactly present the viewpoint of \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva. \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva impregnated the message of Bh\u0101gavatam unto \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, and \u015ar\u012b S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b heard it from him (\u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b).

Rather, they execute their services most carefully, following their predecessors who delivered the spiritual message unbroken to them. Those who listen to the Bh\u0101gavatam may put questions to the speaker in order to elicit the clear meaning, but this should not be done in a challenging spirit. One must submit questions with a great regard for the speaker and the subject matter. This is also the way recommended in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One must learn the transcendental subject by submissive aural reception from the right sources. Therefore these sages addressed the speaker S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b with great respect."

It is called natural because Vy\u0101sadeva is author of both the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, or the essence of all Vedic literatures.

Theism is explained completely in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, whereas in other systems of philosophical speculations, practically no mention is given to the ultimate cause of all causes. One can sit on the vy\u0101s\u0101sana only after being conversant in all systems of philosophy so that one can present fully the theistic views of the Bh\u0101gavatam in defiance of all other systems. \u015ar\u012bla S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b was the proper teacher, and therefore the sages at Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya elevated him to the vy\u0101s\u0101sana. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva is designated herein as the Personality of Godhead because he is the authorized empowered incarnation."

        "translation": "O learned one, in this iron Age of Kali men almost always have but short lives. They are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky and, above all, always disturbed.",
        "purport": " The devotees of the Lord are always anxious for the spiritual improvement of the general public. When the sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya analyzed the state of affairs of the people in this Age of Kali, they foresaw that men would live short lives. In Kali-yuga, the duration of life is shortened not so much because of insufficient food but because of irregular habits. By keeping regular habits and eating simple food, any man can maintain his health. Overeating, over-sense gratification, overdependence on another\u2019s mercy, and artificial standards of living sap the very vitality of human energy. Therefore the duration of life is shortened. The people of this age are also very lazy, not only materially but in the matter of self-realization. The human life is especially meant for self-realization. That is to say, man should come to know what he is, what the world is, and what the supreme truth is. Human life is a means by which the living entity can end all the miseries of the hard struggle for life in material existence and by which he can return to Godhead, his eternal home. But, due to a bad system of education, men have no desire for self-realization. Even if they come to know about it, they unfortunately become victims of misguided teachers. In this age, men are victims not only of different political creeds and parties, but also of many different types of sense gratificatory diversions, such as cinemas, sports, gambling, clubs, mundane libraries, bad association, smoking, drinking, cheating, pilfering, bickerings and so on. Their minds are always disturbed and full of anxieties due to so many different engagements. In this age, many unscrupulous men manufacture their own religious faiths which are not based on any revealed scriptures, and very often people who are addicted to sense gratification are attracted by such institutions. Consequently, in the name of religion so many sinful acts are being carried on that the people in general have neither peace of mind nor health of body. The student (brahmac\u0101r\u012b) communities are no longer being maintained, and householders do not observe the rules and regulations of the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. Consequently, the so-called v\u0101naprasthas and sanny\u0101s\u012bs who come out of such g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015bramas are easily deviated from the rigid path. In the Kali-yuga the whole atmosphere is surcharged with faithlessness. Men are no longer interested in spiritual values. Material sense gratification is now the standard of civilization. For the maintenance of such material civilizations, man has formed complex nations and communities, and there is a constant strain of hot and cold wars between these different groups. It has become very difficult, therefore, to raise the spiritual standard due to the present distorted values of human society. The sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya are anxious to disentangle all fallen souls, and here they are seeking the remedy from \u015ar\u012bla S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b."

Such devotees of the Lord are honored equally with the Lord because they are engaged in the most confidential service of the Lord, for they deliver out of the material world the fallen souls whom the Lord wants to return home, back to Godhead. Such pure devotees are better known as vice-lords according to revealed scriptures. The sincere disciple of the pure devotee considers the spiritual master equal to the Lord, but always considers himself to be a humble servant of the servant of the Lord.

His creations both material and spiritual are all wonderful and contain all variegatedness. They are described nicely by such liberated souls as \u015ar\u012bla N\u0101rada, Vy\u0101sa, V\u0101lm\u012bki, Devala, Asita, Madhva, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya, R\u0101m\u0101nuja, Vi\u1e63\u1e47usv\u0101m\u012b, Nimb\u0101rka, \u015ar\u012bdhara, Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha, Baladeva, Bhaktivinoda, Siddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b and many other learned and self-realized souls. These creations, both material and spiritual, are full of opulence, beauty and knowledge, but the spiritual realm is more magnificent due to its being full of knowledge, bliss and eternity. The material creations are manifested for some time as perverted shadows of the spiritual kingdom and can be likened to cinemas. They attract people of less intelligent caliber who are attracted by false things. Such foolish men have no information of the reality, and they take it for granted that the false material manifestation is the all in all. But more intelligent men guided by sages like Vy\u0101sa and N\u0101rada know that the eternal kingdom of God is more delightful, larger, and eternally full of bliss and knowledge. Those who are not conversant with the activities of the Lord and His transcendental realm are sometimes favored by the Lord in His adventures as incarnations wherein He displays the eternal bliss of His association in the transcendental realm. By such activities He attracts the conditioned souls of the material world. Some of these conditioned souls are engaged in the false enjoyment of material senses and others in simply negating their real life in the spiritual world. These less intelligent persons are known as karm\u012bs, or fruitive workers, and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, or dry mental speculators. But above these two classes of men is the transcendentalist known as s\u0101tvata, or the devotee, who is busy neither with rampant material activity nor with material speculation. He is engaged in the positive service of the Lord, and thereby he derives the highest spiritual benefit unknown to the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs. As the supreme controller of both the material and spiritual worlds, the Lord has different incarnations of unlimited categories. Incarnations like Brahm\u0101, Rudra, Manu, P\u1e5bthu and Vy\u0101sa are His material qualitative incarnations, but His incarnations like R\u0101ma, Narasi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha and V\u0101mana are His transcendental incarnations. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the fountainhead of all incarnations, and He is therefore the cause of all causes."

        "purport": " There is a great difference between mundane stories, fiction, or history and the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. The histories of the whole universe contain references to the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord. The R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and the Pur\u0101\u1e47as are histories of bygone ages recorded in connection with the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord and therefore remain fresh even after repeated readings. For example, anyone may read Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam repeatedly throughout his whole life and yet find in them new light of information. Mundane news is static whereas transcendental news is dynamic, inasmuch as the spirit is dynamic and matter is static. Those who have developed a taste for understanding the transcendental subject matter are never tired of hearing such narrations. One is quickly satiated by mundane activities, but no one is satiated by transcendental or devotional activities. Uttama-\u015bloka indicates that literature which is not meant for nescience. Mundane literature is in the mode of darkness or ignorance, whereas transcendental literature is quite different. Transcendental literature is above the mode of darkness, and its light becomes more luminous with progressive reading and realization of the transcendental subject matter. The so-called liberated persons are never satisfied by the repetition of the words aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi. Such artificial realization of Brahman becomes hackneyed, and so to relish real pleasure they turn to the narrations of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Those who are not so fortunate turn to altruism and worldly philanthropy. This means the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy is mundane, whereas the philosophy of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is transcendental."

        "purport": " The doctrines of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism are never applicable to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Personality of Godhead. The theory that a man becomes God by dint of penance and austerities is very much rampant nowadays, especially in India. Since Lord R\u0101ma, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu were detected by the sages and saints to be the Personality of Godhead as indicated in revealed scriptures, many unscrupulous men have created their own incarnations. This process of concocting an incarnation of God has become an ordinary business, especially in Bengal. Any popular personality with a few traits of mystic powers will display some feat of jugglery and easily become an incarnation of Godhead by popular vote. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not that type of incarnation. He was actually the Personality of Godhead from the very beginning of His appearance. He appeared before His so-called mother as four-armed Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Then, at the request of the mother, He became like a human child and at once left her for another devotee at Gokula, where He was accepted as the son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Ya\u015bod\u0101 M\u0101t\u0101. Similarly, \u015ar\u012b Baladeva, the counterpart of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was also considered a human child born of another wife of \u015ar\u012b Vasudeva. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that His birth and deeds are transcendental and that anyone who is so fortunate as to know the transcendental nature of His birth and deeds will at once become liberated and eligible to return to the kingdom of God. So knowledge of the transcendental nature of the birth and deeds of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sufficient for liberation. In the Bh\u0101gavatam, the transcendental nature of the Lord is described in nine cantos, and in the Tenth Canto His specific pastimes are taken up. All this becomes known as one\u2019s reading of this literature progresses. It is important to note here, however, that the Lord exhibited His divinity even from the lap of His mother, that His deeds are all superhuman (He lifted Govardhana Hill at the age of seven), and that all these acts definitely prove Him to be actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet, due to His mystic covering, He was always accepted as an ordinary human child by His so-called father and mother and other relatives. Whenever some herculean task was performed by Him, the father and mother took it otherwise. And they remained satisfied with unflinching parental love for their son. As such, the sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya describe Him as apparently resembling a human being, but actually He is the supreme almighty Personality of Godhead."

For self-realization, the people in Satya-yuga, living a lifetime of a hundred thousand years, were able to perform prolonged meditation. And in Tret\u0101-yuga, when the duration of life was ten thousand years, self-realization was attained by performance of great sacrifice. And in the Dv\u0101para-yuga, when the duration of life was one thousand years, self-realization was attained by worship of the Lord. But in the Kali-yuga, the maximum duration of life being one hundred years only and that combined with various difficulties, the recommended process of self-realization is that of hearing and chanting of the holy name, fame, and pastimes of the Lord. The sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya began this process in a place meant specifically for the devotees of the Lord. They prepared themselves to hear the pastimes of the Lord over a period of one thousand years. By the example of these sages one should learn that regular hearing and recitation of the Bh\u0101gavatam is the only way for self-realization. Other attempts are simply a waste of time, for they do not give any tangible results. Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu preached this system of Bh\u0101gavata-dharma, and He recommended that all those who were born in India should take the responsibility of broadcasting the messages of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, primarily the message of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. And when one is well established in the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, he can take up the study of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam for further enlightenment in self-realization."

And so this age is very difficult for those who want to utilize this life for self-realization. The people are so busy with sense gratification that they completely forget about self-realization. Out of madness they frankly say that there is no need for self-realization because they do not realize that this brief life is but a moment on our great journey towards self-realization. The whole system of education is geared to sense gratification, and if a learned man thinks it over, he sees that the children of this age are being intentionally sent to the slaughterhouses of so-called education. Learned men, therefore, must be cautious of this age, and if they at all want to cross over the dangerous ocean of Kali, they must follow the footsteps of the sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya and accept \u015ar\u012b S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b or his bona fide representative as the captain of the ship.

        "purport": " Essentially religion is the prescribed codes enunciated by the Personality of Godhead Himself. Whenever there is gross misuse or neglect of the principles of religion, the Supreme Lord appears Himself to restore religious principles. This is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Here the sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya are inquiring about these principles. The reply to this question is given later. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the transcendental sound representation of the Personality of Godhead, and thus it is the full representation of transcendental knowledge and religious principles."
