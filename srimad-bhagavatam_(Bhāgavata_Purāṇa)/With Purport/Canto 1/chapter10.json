Similarly, in the material world the wrath of those who want to lord it over material nature interacts, and the fire of war takes place, exhausting the unwanted population. Such fires or wars take place, and the Lord has nothing to do with them. But because He wants to maintain the creation, He desires the mass of people to follow the right path of self-realization, which enables the living beings to enter into the kingdom of God. The Lord wants the suffering human beings to come back home, back to Him, and cease to suffer the threefold material pangs. The whole plan of creation is made in that way, and one who does not come to his senses suffers in the material world by pangs inflicted by the illusory energy of the Lord. The Lord therefore wants His bona fide representative to rule the world. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descended to establish this sort of regime and to kill the unwanted persons who have nothing to do with His plan. The Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was fought according to the plan of the Lord so that undesirable persons could get out of the world and a peaceful kingdom under His devotee could be established. The Lord was therefore fully satisfied when King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was on the throne and the seedling of the dynasty of Kuru, in the person of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, was saved."

Thus he ruled over the earth and seas and was followed by his younger brothers.",
        "purport": " The modern English law of primogeniture, or the law of inheritance by the firstborn, was also prevalent in those days when Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira ruled the earth and seas. In those days the King of Hastin\u0101pura (now part of New Delhi) was the emperor of the world, including the seas, up to the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, the grandson of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s younger brothers were acting as his ministers and commanders of state, and there was full cooperation between the perfectly religious brothers of the King. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was the ideal king or representative of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to rule over the kingdom of earth and was comparable to King Indra, the representative ruler of the heavenly planets. The demigods like Indra, Candra, S\u016brya, Varu\u1e47a and V\u0101yu are representative kings of different planets of the universe, and similarly Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was also one of them, ruling over the kingdom of the earth. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was not a typically unenlightened political leader of modern democracy. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was instructed by Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva and the infallible Lord also, and therefore he had full knowledge of everything in perfection. The modern elected executive head of a state is just like a puppet because he has no kingly power. Even if he is enlightened like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, he cannot do anything out of his own good will due to his constitutional position. Therefore, there are so many states over the earth quarreling because of ideological differences or other selfish motives. But a king like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira had no ideology of his own. He had but to follow the instructions of the infallible Lord and the Lord\u2019s representative and the authorized agent, Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. It is instructed in the \u015b\u0101stras that one should follow the great authority and the infallible Lord without any personal motive and manufactured ideology. Therefore, it was possible for Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to rule the whole world, including the seas, because the principles were infallible and universally applicable to everyone. The conception of one world state can only be fulfilled if we can follow the infallible authority. An imperfect human being cannot create an ideology acceptable to everyone. Only the perfect and the infallible can create a program which is applicable at every place and can be followed by all in the world. It is the person who rules, and not the impersonal government. If the person is perfect, the government is perfect. If the person is a fool, the government is a fool\u2019s paradise. That is the law of nature. There are so many stories of imperfect kings or executive heads. Therefore, the executive head must be a trained person like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, and he must have the full autocratic power to rule over the world. The conception of a world state can take shape only under the regime of a perfect king like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. The world was happy in those days because there were kings like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to rule over the world."

Due to its fatty milk bag and cheerful attitude, the cow used to moisten the grazing ground with milk.",
        "purport": " The basic principle of economic development is centered on land and cows. The necessities of human society are food grains, fruits, milk, minerals, clothing, wood, etc. One requires all these items to fulfill the material needs of the body. Certainly one does not require flesh and fish or iron tools and machinery. During the regime of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, all over the world there were regulated rainfalls. Rainfalls are not in the control of the human being. The heavenly king Indradeva is the controller of rains, and he is the servant of the Lord. When the Lord is obeyed by the king and the people under the king\u2019s administration, there are regulated rains from the horizon, and these rains are the causes of all varieties of production on the land. Not only do regulated rains help ample production of grains and fruits, but when they combine with astronomical influences there is ample production of valuable stones and pearls. Grains and vegetables can sumptuously feed a man and animals, and a fatty cow delivers enough milk to supply a man sumptuously with vigor and vitality. If there is enough milk, enough grains, enough fruit, enough cotton, enough silk and enough jewels, then why do the people need cinemas, houses of prostitution, slaughterhouses, etc.? What is the need of an artificial luxurious life of cinema, cars, radio, flesh and hotels? Has this civilization produced anything but quarreling individually and nationally? Has this civilization enhanced the cause of equality and fraternity by sending thousands of men into a hellish factory and the warfields at the whims of a particular man? It is said here that the cows used to moisten the pasturing land with milk because their milk bags were fatty and the animals were joyful. Do they not require, therefore, proper protection for a joyful life by being fed with a sufficient quantity of grass in the field? Why should men kill cows for their selfish purposes? Why should man not be satisfied with grains, fruits and milk, which, combined together, can produce hundreds and thousands of palatable dishes? Why are there slaughterhouses all over the world to kill innocent animals? Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, grandson of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, while touring his vast kingdom, saw a black man attempting to kill a cow. The King at once arrested the butcher and chastised him sufficiently. Should not a king or executive head protect the lives of the poor animals who are unable to defend themselves? Is this humanity? Are not the animals of a country citizens also? Then why are they allowed to be butchered in organized slaughterhouses? Are these the signs of equality, fraternity and nonviolence? Therefore, in contrast with the modern, advanced, civilized form of government, an autocracy like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s is by far superior to a so-called democracy in which animals are killed and a man less than an animal is allowed to cast votes for another less-than-animal man. We are all creatures of material nature. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that the Lord Himself is the seed-giving father and material nature is the mother of all living beings in all shapes. Thus mother material nature has enough foodstuff both for animals and for men, by the grace of the Father Almighty, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The human being is the elder brother of all other living beings. He is endowed with intelligence more powerful than animals\u2019 for realizing the course of nature and the indications of the Almighty Father. Human civilizations should depend on the production of material nature without artificially attempting economic development to turn the world into a chaos of artificial greed and power only for the purpose of artificial luxuries and sense gratification. This is but the life of dogs and hogs."

        "purport": " Since Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was under the protection of the ajita, the infallible Lord, as above mentioned, the properties of the Lord, namely the rivers, oceans, hills, forests, etc., were all pleased, and they used to supply their respective quota of taxes to the King. The secret to success is to take refuge under the protection of the Supreme Lord. Without His sanction, nothing can be possible. To make economic development by our own endeavors on the strength of tools and machinery is not all. The sanction of the Supreme Lord must be there, otherwise despite all instrumental arrangements everything will be unsuccessful. The ultimate cause of success is the daiva, the Supreme. Kings like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira knew perfectly well that the king is the agent of the Supreme Lord to look after the welfare of the mass of people. Actually the state belongs to the Supreme Lord. The rivers, oceans, forests, hills, drugs, etc., are not creations of man. They are all creations of the Supreme Lord, and the living being is allowed to make use of the property of the Lord for the service of the Lord. Today\u2019s slogan is that everything is for the people, and therefore the government is for the people and by the people. But to produce a new species of humanity at the present moment on the basis of God consciousness and perfection of human life \u2014 the ideology of godly communism \u2014 the world has to again follow in the footsteps of kings like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira or Par\u012bk\u1e63it. There is enough of everything by the will of the Lord, and we can make proper use of things to live comfortably without enmity between man and man, or man and animal, or man and nature. The control of the Lord is everywhere, and if the Lord is pleased, every part of nature will be pleased. The river will flow profusely to fertilize the land; the oceans will supply sufficient quantities of minerals, pearls and jewels; the forest will supply sufficient wood, drugs and vegetables, and the seasonal changes will effectively help produce fruits and flowers in profuse quantity. The artificial way of living depending on factories and tools can render so-called happiness only to a limited number at the cost of millions. Since the energy of the mass of people is engaged in factory production, the natural products are being hampered, and for this the mass is unhappy. Without being educated properly, the mass of people are following in the footsteps of the vested interests by exploiting natural reserves, and therefore there is acute competition between individual and individual and nation and nation. There is no control by the trained agent of the Lord. We must look into the defects of modern civilization by comparison here, and should follow in the footsteps of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to cleanse man and wipe out anachronisms."

        "purport": " To be nonviolent to human beings and to be a killer or enemy of the poor animals is Satan\u2019s philosophy. In this age there is enmity toward poor animals, and therefore the poor creatures are always anxious. The reaction of the poor animals is being forced on human society, and therefore there is always the strain of cold or hot war between men, individually, collectively or nationally. At the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, there were no different nations, although there were different subordinate states. The whole world was united, and the supreme head, being a trained king like Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, kept all the inhabitants free from anxiety, diseases and excessive heat and cold. They were not only economically well-to-do, but also physically fit and undisturbed by supernatural power, by enmity from other living beings and by disturbance of bodily and mental agonies. There is a proverb in Bengali that a bad king spoils the kingdom and a bad housewife spoils the family. This truth is applicable here also. Because the King was pious and obedient to the Lord and sages, because he was no one\u2019s enemy and because he was a recognized agent of the Lord and therefore protected by Him, all the citizens under the King\u2019s protection were, so to speak, directly protected by the Lord and His authorized agents. Unless one is pious and recognized by the Lord, he cannot make others happy who are under his care. There is full cooperation between man and God and man and nature, and this conscious cooperation between man and God and man and nature, as exemplified by King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, can bring about happiness, peace and prosperity in the world. The attitude of exploiting one another, the custom of the day, will only bring misery."

After His separation from V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and the innocent rural cowherd boys, girls, ladies and others, they all felt shock throughout their lives, and the separation of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, the most beloved cowherd girl, is beyond expression. Once they met at Kuruk\u1e63etra during a solar eclipse, and the feeling which was expressed by them is heartrending. There is, of course, a difference in the qualities of the transcendental devotees of the Lord, but none of them who have ever contacted the Lord by direct communion or otherwise can leave Him for a moment. That is the attitude of the pure devotee."

How then could the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas tolerate His separation, for they had been intimately associated with His person, seeing Him face to face, touching Him, conversing with Him, and sleeping, sitting and dining with Him?",
        "purport": " The living being\u2019s constitutional position is one of serving a superior. He is obliged to serve by force the dictates of illusory material energy in different phases of sense gratification. And in serving the senses he is never tired. Even though he may be tired, the illusory energy perpetually forces him to do so without being satisfied. There is no end to such sense gratificatory business, and the conditioned soul becomes entangled in such servitude without hope of release. The release is only effected by association with pure devotees. By such association one is gradually promoted to his transcendental consciousness. Thus he can know that his eternal position is to render service unto the Lord and not to the perverted senses in the capacity of lust, anger, desire to lord it over, etc. Material society, friendship and love are all different phases of lust. Home, country, family, society, wealth and all sorts of corollaries are all causes of bondage in the material world, where the threefold miseries of life are concomitant factors. By associating with pure devotees and by hearing them submissively, attachment for material enjoyment becomes slackened, and attraction for hearing about the transcendental activities of the Lord becomes prominent. Once they are, they will go on progressively without stoppage, like fire in gunpowder. It is said that Hari, the Personality of Godhead, is so transcendentally attractive that even those who are self-satisfied by self-realization and are factually liberated from all material bondage also become devotees of the Lord. Under the circumstances it is easily understood what must have been the position of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were constant companions of the Lord. They could not even think of separation from \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, since the attraction was more intense for them because of continuous personal contact. His remembrance by His form, quality, name, fame, pastimes, etc., is also attractive for the pure devotee, so much so that he forgets all forms, quality, name, fame and activities of the mundane world, and due to his mature association with pure devotees he is not out of contact with the Lord for a moment."

This shyness is a gift of nature to the fair sex, and it enhances their beauty and prestige, even if they are of a less important family or even if they are less attractive. We have practical experience of this fact. A sweeper woman commanded the respect of many respectable gentlemen simply by manifesting a lady\u2019s shyness. Half-naked ladies in the street do not command any respect, but a shy sweeper\u2019s wife commands respect from all. Human civilization, as conceived of by the sages of India, is to help one free himself from the clutches of illusion. The material beauty of a woman is an illusion because actually the body is made of earth, water, fire, air, etc. But because there is the association of the living spark with matter, it appears to be beautiful. No one is attracted by an earthen doll, even if it is most perfectly prepared to attract the attention of others. The dead body has no beauty because no one will accept the dead body of a so-called beautiful woman. Therefore, the conclusion is that the spirit spark is beautiful, and because of the soul\u2019s beauty one is attracted by the beauty of the outward body. The Vedic wisdom, therefore, forbids us to be attracted by false beauty. But because we are now in the darkness of ignorance, the Vedic civilization allows very restricted mixing of woman and man. They say that the woman is considered to be the fire, and the man is considered to be the butter. The butter must melt in association with fire, and therefore they may be brought together only when it is necessary. And shyness is a check to the unrestricted mixing. It is nature\u2019s gift, and it must be utilized."

He is nirgu\u1e47a, or there are no material qualities in Him, but He is full of transcendental qualities. In the transcendental world there is nothing contradictory, whereas in the relative world everything has its opposite. In the relative world white is the opposite conception of black, but in the transcendental world there is no distinction between white and black. Therefore the sounds of benedictions uttered by the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as here and there appear to be contradictory in relation with the Absolute Person, but when they are applied to the Absolute Person they lose all contradiction and become transcendental. One example may clear this idea. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sometimes described as a thief. He is very famous amongst His pure devotees as the M\u0101khana-cora. He used to steal butter from the houses of neighbors at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in His early age. Since then He is famous as a thief. But in spite of His being famous as a thief, He is worshiped as a thief, whereas in the mundane world a thief is punished and is never praised. Since He is the Absolute Personality of Godhead, everything is applicable to Him, and still in spite of all contradictions He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Factually the glories of the Lord are depicted in such literature as the Vedas, R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. And in the Bh\u0101gavatam they are specifically mentioned in respect to the Supreme Lord. Therefore, while the ladies on the tops of the houses in the capital of the kings of the Kuru dynasty were talking about the Lord, their talk was more pleasing than the Vedic hymns. Anything sung in the praise of the Lord is \u015bruti-mantra. There are songs of \u1e6ch\u0101kura Narottama d\u0101sa, one of the \u0101c\u0101ryas in the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya samprad\u0101ya, composed in simple Bengali language. But \u1e6ch\u0101kura Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, another very learned \u0101c\u0101rya of the same samprad\u0101ya, has approved the songs by \u1e6ch\u0101kura Narottama d\u0101sa to be as good as Vedic mantras. And this is so because of the subject matter. The language is immaterial, but the subject matter is important. The ladies, who were all absorbed in the thought and actions of the Lord, developed the consciousness of Vedic wisdom by the grace of the Lord. And therefore although such ladies might not have been very learned scholars in Sanskrit or otherwise, still whatever they spoke was more attractive than the Vedic hymns. The Vedic hymns in the Upani\u1e63ads are sometimes indirectly directed to the Supreme Lord. But the talks of the ladies were directly spoken of the Lord, and thus they were more pleasing to the heart. The ladies\u2019 talks appeared to be more valuable than the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 benedictions."

He alone existed before the manifested creation of the modes of nature, and in Him only, because He is the Supreme Lord, all living beings merge, as if sleeping at night, their energy suspended.",
        "purport": " There are two types of dissolution of the manifested cosmos. At the end of every 4,320,000,000 solar years, when Brahm\u0101, the lord of one particular universe, goes to sleep, there is one annihilation. And at the end of Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s life, which takes place at the end of Brahm\u0101\u2019s one hundred years of age, in our calculation at the end of 8,640,000,000 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 100 solar years, there is complete annihilation of the entire universe, and in both the periods both the material energy called the mahat-tattva and the marginal energy called j\u012bva-tattva merge in the person of the Supreme Lord. The living beings remain asleep within the body of the Lord until there is another creation of the material world, and that is the way of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material manifestation. The material creation is effected by the interaction of the three modes of material nature set in action by the Lord, and therefore it is said here that the Lord existed before the modes of material nature were set in motion. In the \u015bruti-mantra it is said that only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Lord, existed before the creation, and there was no Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva or other demigods. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u means the Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is lying on the Causal Ocean. By His breathing only all the universes are generated in seeds and gradually develop into gigantic forms with innumerable planets within each and every universe. The seeds of universes develop into gigantic forms in the way seeds of a banyan tree develop into numberless banyan trees. This Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the plenary portion of the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is mentioned in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.48) as follows: \u201cLet me offer my respectful obeisances unto the original Personality of Godhead Govinda, whose plenary portion is the Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. All the Brahm\u0101s, the heads of the universes, live only for the period of His exhaling, after the universes are generated from the pores of His transcendental body.\u201d Thus Govinda, or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the cause of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u also. The ladies talking about this Vedic truth must have heard it from authoritative sources. An authoritative source is the only means of knowing about transcendental subject matter definitely. There is no alternative. The merging of the living beings into the body of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u takes place automatically at the end of Brahm\u0101\u2019s one hundred years. But that does not mean that the individual living being loses his identity. The identity is there, and as soon as there is another creation by the supreme will of the Lord, all the sleeping, inactive living beings are again let loose to begin their activities in the continuation of past different spheres of life. It is called suptotthita-ny\u0101ya, or awakening from sleep and again engaging in one\u2019s respective continuous duty. When a man is asleep at night, he forgets himself, what he is, what his duty is and everything of his waking state. But as soon as he awakens from slumber, he remembers all that he has to do and thus engages himself again in his prescribed activities. The living beings also remain merged in the body of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u during the period of annihilation, but as soon as there is another creation they arise to take up their unfinished work. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.18-19). The Lord existed before the creative energy was set in action. The Lord is not a product of the material energy. His body is completely spiritual, and there is no difference between His body and Himself. Before creation the Lord remained in His abode, which is absolute and one."

        "translation": "The Personality of Godhead, again desiring to give names and forms to His parts and parcels, the living entities, placed them under the guidance of material nature. By His own potency, material nature is empowered to re-create.",
        "purport": " The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord. They are of two varieties, namely nitya-mukta and nitya-baddha. The nitya-muktas are eternally liberated souls, and they are eternally engaged in the reciprocation of transcendental loving service with the Lord in His eternal abode beyond the manifested mundane creations. But the nitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned souls, are entrusted to His external energy, m\u0101y\u0101, for rectification of their rebellious attitude toward the supreme father. Nitya-baddhas are eternally forgetful of their relation with the Lord as parts and parcels. They are bewildered by the illusory energy as products of matter, and thus they are very busy in making plans in the material world for becoming happy. They go on merrily with plans, but by the will of the Lord both the plan-makers and the plans are annihilated at the end of a certain period, as above mentioned. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.7) as follows: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, at the end of the millennium all the living entities merge into My nature, and again when the time of creation is ripe, I begin creation by the agency of My external energy.\u201d The word bh\u016bya\u1e25 indicates \u201cagain and again\u201d \u2014 that is to say, the process of creation, maintenance and annihilation is going on perpetually by the external energy of the Lord. He is the cause of everything. But the living beings, who are constitutionally part and parcel of the Lord and are forgetful of the sweet relation, are given a chance again and again to get rid of the clutches of the external energy. And to revive his (the living being\u2019s) consciousness, the revealed scriptures are also created by the Lord. Vedic literatures are the guiding directions for the conditioned souls so they can get free from the repetition of creation and annihilation of the material world and the material body. The Lord says in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u201cThis created world and material energy are under My control. Under the influence of prak\u1e5bti, automatically they are created again and again, and this is done by Me through the agency of My external energy.\u201d Actually the spiritual-spark living entities have no material names or forms. But in order to fulfill their desire to lord it over the material energy of material forms and names, they are given a chance for such false enjoyment, and at the same time they are given a chance to understand the real position through the revealed scriptures. The foolish and forgetful living being is always busy with false forms and false names. Modern nationalism is the culmination of such false names and false forms. Men are mad after false name and form. The form of body obtained under certain conditions is taken up as factual, and the name also taken bewilders the conditioned soul into misusing the energy in the name of so many \u201cisms.\u201d The scriptures, however, supply the clue for understanding the real position, but men are reluctant to take lessons from the scriptures created by the Lord for different places and times. For example, the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the guiding principle for all human beings, but by the spell of material energy they do not take care to carry out the programs of life in terms of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the postgraduate study of knowledge for one who has thoroughly understood the principles of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Unfortunately people have no taste for them, and therefore they are under the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 for repetition of birth and death."

        "purport": " As it is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord can be known in His real nature by dint of pure devotional service only. So it is stated here that only the great devotees of the Lord who are able to clear the mind of all material dust by rigid devotional service can experience the Lord as He is. Jitendriya means one who has full control over the senses. The senses are active parts of the body, and their activities cannot be stopped. The artificial means of the yogic processes to make the senses inactive has proved to be abject failure, even in the case of great yog\u012bs like Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra Muni. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra Muni controlled the senses by yogic trance, but when he happened to meet Menak\u0101 (a heavenly society woman), he became a victim of sex, and the artificial way of controlling the senses failed. But in the case of a pure devotee, the senses are not at all artificially stopped from doing anything, but they are given different good engagements. When the senses are engaged in more attractive activities, there is no chance of their being attracted by any inferior engagements. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that the senses can be controlled only by better engagements. Devotional service necessitates purifying the senses or engaging them in the activities of devotional service. Devotional service is not inaction. Anything done in the service of the Lord becomes at once purified of its material nature. The material conception is due to ignorance only. There is nothing beyond V\u0101sudeva. The V\u0101sudeva conception gradually develops in the heart of the learned after a prolonged acceleration of the receptive organs. But the process ends in the knowledge of accepting V\u0101sudeva as all in all. In the case of devotional service, this very same method is accepted from the very beginning, and by the grace of the Lord all factual knowledge becomes revealed in the heart of a devotee due to dictation by the Lord from within. Therefore controlling the senses by devotional service is the only and easiest means."

        "purport": " As mentioned above, the cosmic creation is the property of the Supreme Lord. This is the basic philosophy of \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad: everything is the property of the Supreme Being. No one should encroach upon the property of the Supreme Lord. One should accept only what is kindly awarded by Him. Therefore, the earth or any other planet or universe is the absolute property of the Lord. The living beings are certainly His parts and parcels, or sons, and thus every one of them has a right to live at the mercy of the Lord to execute his prescribed work. No one, therefore, can encroach upon the right of another individual man or animal without being so sanctioned by the Lord. The king or the administrator is the representative of the Lord to look after the management of the Lord\u2019s will. He must therefore be a recognized person like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira or Par\u012bk\u1e63it. Such kings have full responsibility and knowledge from authorities about the administration of the world. But at times, due to the influence of the ignorance mode of material nature (tamo-gu\u1e47a), the lowest of the material modes, kings and administrators come into power without knowledge and responsibility, and such foolish administrators live like animals for the sake of their own personal interest. The result is that the whole atmosphere becomes surcharged with anarchy and vicious elements. Nepotism, bribery, cheating, aggression and, therefore, famine, epidemic, war and similar other disturbing features become prominent in human society. And the devotees of the Lord or the faithful are persecuted by all means. All these symptoms indicate the time of an incarnation of the Lord to reestablish the principles of religion and to vanquish the maladministrators. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord then appears in His transcendental form without any tinge of material qualities. He descends just to keep the state of His creation in a normal condition. The normal condition is that the Lord has provided each and every planet with all the needs of the native living beings. They can happily live and execute their predestined occupations to attain salvation at the end, following the rules and regulations mentioned in the revealed scriptures. The material world is created to satisfy the whims of the nitya-baddha, or everlasting conditioned souls, just as naughty boys are provided with playing cradles. Otherwise, there was no need of the material world. But when they become intoxicated with the power of material science to exploit the resources unlawfully without the sanction of the Lord, and that also only for sense gratification, there is necessity of the Lord\u2019s incarnation to chastise the rebellious and to protect the faithful. When He descends, He exhibits superhuman acts just to prove His supreme right, and materialists like R\u0101va\u1e47a, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and Ka\u1e41sa are sufficiently punished. He acts in a manner which no one can imitate. For example, the Lord, when He appeared as R\u0101ma, bridged the Indian Ocean. When He appeared as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, from His very childhood He showed superhuman activities by killing P\u016btan\u0101, Agh\u0101sura, \u015aaka\u1e6d\u0101sura, K\u0101liya, etc., and then His maternal uncle Ka\u1e41sa. When He was at Dv\u0101rak\u0101 He married 16,108 queens, and all of them were blessed with a sufficient number of children. The sum total of His personal family members amounted to about 100,000, popularly known as the Yadu-va\u1e41\u015ba. And again, during His lifetime, He managed to vanquish them all. He is famous as the Govardhana-dh\u0101r\u012b Hari because He lifted at the age of only seven the hill known as Govardhana. The Lord killed many undesirable kings in His time, and as a k\u1e63atriya He fought chivalrously. He is famous as asamordhva, unparalleled. No one is equal to or greater than Him."

        "purport": " In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has expressively given a description of His transcendental appearance, disappearance and activities. The Lord appears in a particular family or place by His inconceivable potency. He does not take His birth as a conditioned soul quits his body and accepts another body. His birth is like the appearance and disappearance of the sun. The sun arises on the eastern horizon, but that does not mean that the eastern horizon is the parent of the sun. The sun is existent in every part of the solar system, but he becomes visible at a scheduled time and so also becomes invisible at another scheduled time. Similarly, the Lord appears in this universe like the sun and again leaves our sight at another time. He exists at all times and at every place, but by His causeless mercy when He appears before us we take it for granted that He has taken His birth. Anyone who can understand this truth, in terms of the statements of revealed scriptures, certainly becomes liberated just after quitting the present body. Liberation is obtainable after many births and after great endeavor in patience and perseverance, in knowledge and renunciation. But simply by knowing in truth about the Lord\u2019s transcendental births and activities, one can get liberation at once. That is the verdict of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. But those who are in the darkness of ignorance conclude that the Lord\u2019s birth and activities in the material world are similar to those of the ordinary living being. Such imperfect conclusions cannot give anyone liberation. His birth, therefore, in the family of King Yadu as the son of King Vasudeva and His transfer into the family of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja in the land of Mathur\u0101 are all transcendental arrangements made by the internal potency of the Lord. The fortunes of the Yadu dynasty and that of the inhabitants of the land of Mathur\u0101 cannot be materially estimated. If simply by knowing the transcendental nature of the birth and activities of the Lord one can get liberation easily, we can just imagine what is in store for those who actually enjoyed the company of the Lord in person as a family member or as a neighbor. All those who were fortunate enough to associate with the Lord, the husband of the goddess of fortune, certainly obtained something more than what is known as liberation. Therefore, rightly, the dynasty and the land are both ever glorious by the grace of the Lord."

        "translation": "Undoubtedly it is wonderful that Dv\u0101rak\u0101 has defeated the glories of the heavenly planets and has enhanced the celebrity of the earth. The inhabitants of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 are always seeing the soul of all living beings [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a] in His loving feature. He glances at them and favors them with sweet smiles.",
        "purport": " The heavenly planets are inhabited by demigods like Indra, Candra, Varu\u1e47a and V\u0101yu, and the pious souls reach there after performance of many virtuous acts on earth. Modern scientists agree that the timing arrangement in higher planetary systems is different from that of the earth. Thus it is understood from the revealed scriptures that the duration of life there is ten thousand years (by our calculation). Six months on earth is equal to one day on the heavenly planets. Facilities of enjoyment are also similarly enhanced, and the beauty of the inhabitants is legendary. Common men on the earth are very much fond of reaching the heavenly planets because they have heard that comforts of life are far greater there than on the earth. They are now trying to reach the moon by spacecraft. Considering all this, the heavenly planets are more celebrated than the earth. But the celebrity of earth has defeated that of the heavenly planets because of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, where Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reigned as King. Three places, namely V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Mathur\u0101 and Dv\u0101rak\u0101, are more important than the famous planets within the universe. These places are perpetually sanctified because whenever the Lord descends to earth He displays His transcendental activities particularly in these three places. They are perpetually the holy lands of the Lord, and the inhabitants still take advantage of the holy places, even though the Lord is now out of their sight. The Lord is the soul of all living beings, and He desires always to have all the living beings, in their svar\u016bpa, in their constitutional position, to participate in transcendental life in His association. His attractive features and sweet smiles go deep into the heart of everyone, and once it is so done the living being is admitted into the kingdom of God, from which no one returns. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The heavenly planets may be very famous for offering better facilities of material enjoyment, but as we learn from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.20-21), one has to come back again to the earth planet as soon as the acquired virtue is finished. Dv\u0101rak\u0101 is certainly more important than the heavenly planets because whoever has been favored with the smiling glance of the Lord shall never come back again to this rotten earth, which is certified by the Lord Himself as a place of misery. Not only this earth but also all the planets of the universes are places of misery because in none of the planets within the universe is there eternal life, eternal bliss and eternal knowledge. Any person engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is recommended to live in one of the above-mentioned three places, namely Dv\u0101rak\u0101, Mathur\u0101 or V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Because devotional service in these three places is magnified, those who go there to follow the principles in terms of instructions imparted in the revealed scriptures surely achieve the same result as obtained during the presence of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His abode and He Himself are identical, and a pure devotee under the guidance of another experienced devotee can obtain all the results, even at present."

        "purport": " Religious rites prescribed in the scriptures are meant to purify the mundane qualities of the conditioned souls to enable them to be gradually promoted to the stage of rendering transcendental service unto the Supreme Lord. Attainment of this stage of pure spiritual life is the highest perfection, and this stage is called svar\u016bpa, or the factual identity of the living being. Liberation means renovation of this stage of svar\u016bpa. In that perfect stage of svar\u016bpa, the living being is established in five phases of loving service, one of which is the stage of m\u0101dhurya-rasa, or the humor of conjugal love. The Lord is always perfect in Himself, and thus He has no hankering for Himself. He, however, becomes a master, a friend, a son or a husband to fulfill the intense love of the devotee concerned. Herein two classes of devotees of the Lord are mentioned in the stage of conjugal love. One is svak\u012bya, and the other is parak\u012bya. Both of them are in conjugal love with the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The queens at Dv\u0101rak\u0101 were svak\u012bya, or duly married wives, but the damsels of Vraja were young friends of the Lord while He was unmarried. The Lord stayed at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana till the age of sixteen, and His friendly relations with the neighboring girls were in terms of parak\u012bya. These girls, as well as the queens, underwent severe penances by taking vows, bathing and offering sacrifices in the fire, as prescribed in the scriptures. The rites, as they are, are not an end in themselves, nor are fruitive action, culture of knowledge or perfection in mystic powers ends in themselves. They are all means to attain to the highest stage of svar\u016bpa, to render constitutional transcendental service to the Lord. Each and every living being has his individual position in one of the above-mentioned five different kinds of reciprocating means with the Lord, and in one\u2019s pure spiritual form of svar\u016bpa the relation becomes manifest without mundane affinity. The kissing of the Lord, either by His wives or His young girlfriends who aspired to have the Lord as their fiance, is not of any mundane perverted quality. Had such things been mundane, a liberated soul like \u015aukadeva would not have taken the trouble to relish them, nor would Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu have been inclined to participate in those subjects after renouncing worldly life. The stage is earned after many lives of penance."

And other ladies were also forcibly taken away by Him after He killed Bhaum\u0101sura and thousands of his assistants. All of these ladies are glorious.",
        "purport": " Exceptionally qualified daughters of powerful kings were allowed to make a choice of their own bridegrooms in open competition, and such ceremonies were called svaya\u1e41vara, or selection of the bridegroom. Because the svaya\u1e41vara was an open competition between the rival and valiant princes, such princes were invited by the father of the princess, and usually there were regular fights between the invited princely order in a sporting spirit. But it so happened that sometimes the belligerent princes were killed in such marriage-fighting, and the victorious prince was offered the trophy princess for whom so many princes died. Rukmi\u1e47\u012b, the principal queen of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was the daughter of the King of Vidarbha, who wished that his qualified and beautiful daughter be given away to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But her eldest brother wanted her to be given away to King \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la, who happened to be a cousin of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So there was open competition, and as usual Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a emerged successful, after harassing \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la and other princes by His unrivalled prowess. Rukmi\u1e47\u012b had ten sons, like Pradyumna. There were other queens also taken away by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a similar way. Full description of this beautiful booty of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be given in the Tenth Canto. There were 16,100 beautiful girls who were daughters of many kings and were forcibly stolen by Bhaum\u0101sura, who kept them captive for his carnal desire. These girls prayed piteously to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for their deliverance, and the merciful Lord, called by their fervent prayer, released them all by fighting and killing Bhaum\u0101sura. All these captive princesses were then accepted by the Lord as His wives, although in the estimation of society they were all fallen girls. The all-powerful Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a accepted the humble prayers of these girls and married them with the adoration of queens. So altogether Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had 16,108 queens at Dv\u0101rak\u0101, and in each of them He begot ten children. All these children grew up, and each had as many children as the father. The aggregate of the family numbered in the millions."

        "purport": " The devotees of the Lord are purified souls. As soon as the devotees surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord sincerely, the Lord accepts them, and thus the devotees at once become free from all material contaminations. Such devotees are above the three modes of material nature. There is no bodily disqualification of a devotee, just as there is no qualitative difference between the Ganges water and the filthy drain water when they are amalgamated. Women, merchants and laborers are not very intelligent, and thus it is very difficult for them to understand the science of God or to be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. They are more materialistic, and less than them are the Kir\u0101tas, H\u016b\u1e47as, \u0100ndhras, Pulindas, Pulka\u015bas, \u0100bh\u012bras, Ka\u1e45kas, Yavanas, Khasas, etc., but all of them can be delivered if they are properly engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. By engagement in the service of the Lord, the designative disqualifications are removed, and as pure souls they become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God. The fallen girls under the clutches of Bhaum\u0101sura sincerely prayed to Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for their deliverance, and their sincerity of purpose made them at once pure by virtue of devotion. The Lord therefore accepted them as His wives, and thus their lives became glorified. Such auspicious glorification was still more glorified when the Lord played with them as the most devoted husband. The Lord used to live with His 16,108 wives constantly. He expanded Himself into 16,108 plenary portions, and each and every one of Them was the Lord Himself without deviation from the original personality. The \u015bruti-mantra affirms that the Lord can expand Himself into many. As husband of so many wives, He pleased them all with presentations, even at a costly endeavor. He brought the p\u0101rij\u0101ta plant from heaven and implanted it at the palace of Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, one of the principal queens. If, therefore, anyone desires the Lord to become one\u2019s husband, the Lord fulfills such desires in full."

The charioteers could fight with many horses and elephants by the strength of powerful arrows, even up to the standard of the brahm\u0101stra (similar to modern atomic weapons). Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira knew well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everyone\u2019s friend and well-wisher, and yet there were asuras who were by nature envious of the Lord. So out of fear of attack from others and out of affection also, he engaged all varieties of defensive forces as bodyguards of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If required, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself was sufficient to defend Himself from the attack of others who counted the Lord as their enemy, but still He accepted all the arrangements made by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira because He could not disobey the King, who was His elder cousin. The Lord plays the part of a subordinate in His transcendental sporting, and thus sometimes He puts Himself in the care of Ya\u015bod\u0101m\u0101t\u0101 for His protection in His so-called helplessness of childhood. That is the transcendental l\u012bl\u0101, or pastime of the Lord. The basic principle for all transcendental exchanges between the Lord and His devotees is exhibited to enjoy a transcendental bliss for which there is no comparison, even up to the level of brahm\u0101nanda."

After crossing these provinces He gradually reached the Sauv\u012bra and \u0100bh\u012bra provinces, then, west of these, reached Dv\u0101rak\u0101 at last.",
        "purport": " The provinces passed over by the Lord in those days were differently named, but the direction given is sufficient to indicate that He traveled through Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Saurastra and Gujarat and at last reached His home province at Dv\u0101rak\u0101. We do not gain any profit simply by researching the analogous provinces of those days up to now, but it appears that the desert of Rajasthan and the provinces of scanty water like Madhya Pradesh were present even five thousand years ago. The theory of soil experts that the desert developed in recent years is not supported by the statements of Bh\u0101gavatam. We may leave the matter for expert geologists to research because the changing universe has different phases of geological development. We are satisfied that the Lord has now reached His own province, Dv\u0101rak\u0101-dh\u0101ma, from the Kuru provinces. Kuruk\u1e63etra continues to exist since the Vedic age, and it is sheer foolishness when interpreters ignore or deny the existence of Kuruk\u1e63etra."

        "translation": "On His journey through these provinces He was welcomed, worshiped and given various presentations. In the evening, in all places, the Lord suspended His journey to perform evening rites. This was regularly observed after sunset.",
        "purport": " It is said here that the Lord observed the religious principles regularly while He was on the journey. There are certain philosophical speculations that even the Lord is under the obligations of fruitive action. But actually this is not the case. He does not depend on the action of any good or bad work. Since the Lord is absolute, everything done by Him is good for everyone. But when He descends to the earth, He acts for the protection of the devotees and for the annihilation of the impious nondevotees. Although He has no obligatory duty, still He does everything so that others may follow. That is the way of factual teaching; one must act properly himself and teach the same to others, otherwise no one will accept one\u2019s blind teaching. He is Himself the awarder of fruitive results. He is self-sufficient, and yet He acts according to the rulings of the revealed scripture in order to teach us the process. If He does not do so, the common man may go wrong. But in the advanced stage, when one can understand the transcendental nature of the Lord, one does not try to imitate Him. This is not possible. The Lord in human society does what is the duty of everyone, but sometimes He does something extraordinary and not to be imitated by the living being. His acts of evening prayer as stated herein must be followed by the living being, but it is not possible to follow His mountain-lifting or dancing with the gop\u012bs. One cannot imitate the sun, which can exhaust water even from a filthy place; the most powerful can do something which is all-good, but our imitation of such acts will put us into endless difficulty. Therefore, in all actions, the experienced guide, the spiritual master, who is the manifested mercy of the Lord, should always be consulted, and the path of progress will be assured."
