        "purport": " When civilization is disconnected from the loving relation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, symptoms like changes of seasonal regulations, foul means of livelihood, greed, anger and fraudulence become rampant. The change of seasonal regulations refers to one season\u2019s atmosphere becoming manifest in another season \u2014 for example the rainy season\u2019s being transferred to autumn, or the fructification of fruits and flowers from one season in another season. A godless man is invariably greedy, angry and fraudulent. Such a man can earn his livelihood by any means, black or white. During the reign of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, all the above symptoms were conspicuous by their absence. But Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was astonished to experience even a slight change in the godly atmosphere of his kingdom, and at once he suspected the disappearance of the Lord. Foul means of livelihood implies deviation from one\u2019s occupational duty. There are prescribed duties for everyone, such as the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra, but anyone who deviates from his prescribed duty and declares another\u2019s duty to be his own is following a foul and improper duty. A man becomes too greedy for wealth and power when he has no higher objective in life and when he thinks that this earthly life of a few years is all in all. Ignorance is the cause for all these anomalies in human society, and to remove this ignorance, especially in this age of degradation, the powerful sun is there to distribute light in the shape of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

And this cheating practice is there in the conditioned souls because the conditioned souls are primarily in the material world imbued with an unnatural desire to lord it over the material world. A living being in his pure state is not conditioned by the laws because in his pure state he is conscious that a living being is eternally subservient to the Supreme Being, and thus it is always good for him to remain subservient, instead of falsely trying to lord it over the property of the Supreme Lord. In the conditioned state the living being is not satisfied even if he actually becomes the lord of all that he surveys, which he never becomes, and therefore he becomes the victim of all kinds of cheating, even with his nearest and most intimate relations. In such an unsatisfactory state of affairs, there is no harmony, even between father and sons or between husband and wife. But all these contending difficulties can be mitigated by one process, and that is the devotional service of the Lord. The world of hypocrisy can be checked only by counteraction through devotional service to the Lord and nothing else. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, having observed the disparities, conjectured the disappearance of the Lord from the earth."

        "purport": " As we have discussed many times, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has many plenary expansions, and each and every one of them, although equally powerful, executes different functions. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 there are different statements by the Lord, and each of these statements is meant for different plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions. For example, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord, says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself.\u201d (Bg. 4.7) \u201cTo deliver the faithful, to annihilate the miscreants and also to reestablish the principles of occupational duty, I appear in every age.\u201d (Bg. 4.8) \u201cIf I should cease to work, then all humanity would be misdirected. I would also be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby destroy the peace of all sentient beings.\u201d (Bg. 3.24) \u201cWhatever action a great man performs, common men will follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.\u201d (Bg. 3.21) All the above statements by the Lord apply to different plenary portions of the Lord, namely His expansions such as Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. These are all He Himself in different transcendental expansions, and still the Lord as \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a functions in a different sphere of transcendental exchange with different grades of devotees. And yet Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is appears once every twenty-four hours of Brahm\u0101\u2019s time (or after a lapse of 8,640,000,000 solar years) in each and every universe, and all His transcendental pastimes are displayed in each and every universe in a routine spool. But in that routine spool the functions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord V\u0101sudeva, etc., are complex problems for the layman. There is no difference between the Lord\u2019s Self and the Lord\u2019s transcendental body. The expansions execute differential activities. When the Lord, however, appears in His person as Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, His other plenary portions also join in Him by His inconceivable potency called yogam\u0101y\u0101, and thus the Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is different from the Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a of Mathur\u0101 or the Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. The vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also different from Him, by His inconceivable potency. The vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa exhibited on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra is the material conception of His form. Therefore it should be understood that when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was apparently killed by the bow and arrow of the hunter, the Lord left His so-called material body in the material world. The Lord is kaivalya, and for Him there is no difference between matter and spirit because everything is created from Him. Therefore His quitting one sort of body or accepting another body does not mean that He is like the ordinary living being. All such activities are simultaneously one and different by His inconceivable potency. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was lamenting the possibility of His disappearance, it was just in pursuance of a custom of lamenting the disappearance of a great friend, but factually the Lord never quits His transcendental body, as is misconceived by less intelligent persons. Such less intelligent persons have been condemned by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and they are known as the m\u016b\u1e0dhas. That the Lord left His body means that He left again His plenary portions in the respective dh\u0101mas (transcendental abodes), as He left His vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa in the material world."

        "purport": " Material prosperity consists of a good wife, good home, sufficient land, good children, aristocratic family relations, victory over competitors and, by pious work, attainment of accommodations in the higher celestial planets for better facilities of material amenities. These facilities are earned not only by one\u2019s hard manual labor or by unfair means, but by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Prosperity earned by one\u2019s personal endeavor also depends on the mercy of the Lord. Personal labor must be there in addition to the Lord\u2019s benediction, but without the Lord\u2019s benediction no one is successful simply by personal labor. The modernized man of Kali-yuga believes in personal endeavor and denies the benediction of the Supreme Lord. Even a great sanny\u0101s\u012b of India delivered speeches in Chicago protesting the benedictions of the Supreme Lord. But as far as Vedic \u015b\u0101stras are concerned, as we find in the pages of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the ultimate sanction for all success rests in the hands of the Supreme Lord. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira admits this truth in his personal success, and it behooves one to follow in the footsteps of a great king and devotee of the Lord to make life a full success. If one could achieve success without the sanction of the Lord then no medical practitioner would fail to cure a patient. Despite the most advanced treatment of a suffering patient by the most up-to-date medical practitioner, there is death, and even in the most hopeless case, without medical treatment, a patient is cured astonishingly. Therefore the conclusion is that God\u2019s sanction is the immediate cause for all happenings, good or bad. Any successful man should feel grateful to the Lord for all he has achieved."

Therefore our constant touch with the Lord by devotional service can give us relief without our being disturbed in the discharge of our human duties. The asuras, however, who do not believe in the existence of God, make their own plans to counteract all these threefold miseries, and so they meet with failures every time. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14) clearly states that the reaction of material energy is never to be conquered, because of the binding effects of the three modes.

Similarly, undesirable happenings in life cannot be checked by any number of plans. Such miseries can be removed only by the mercy of the Lord, who sends His bona fide representatives to enlighten human beings and thus save them from all calamities."

        "purport": " Hastin\u0101pura, the capital of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, was situated somewhere near present New Delhi, and the kingdom of Ugrasena was situated in Mathur\u0101. While returning to Delhi from Dv\u0101rak\u0101, Arjuna must have visited the city of Mathur\u0101, and therefore the inquiry about the King of Mathur\u0101 is valid. Amongst various names of the relatives, the name of R\u0101ma or Balar\u0101ma, eldest brother of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is added with the words \u201cthe Personality of Godhead\u201d because Lord Balar\u0101ma is the immediate expansion of vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva as prak\u0101\u015ba-vigraha of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Supreme Lord, although one without a second, expands Himself as many other living beings. The vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva living beings are expansions of the Supreme Lord, and all of them are qualitatively and quantitatively equal with the Lord. But expansions of the j\u012bva-\u015bakti, the category of the ordinary living beings, are not at all equal with the Lord. One who considers the j\u012bva-\u015bakti and the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva to be on an equal level is considered a condemned soul of the world. \u015ar\u012b R\u0101ma, or Balar\u0101ma, is the protector of the devotees of the Lord. Baladeva acts as the spiritual master of all devotees, and by His causeless mercy the fallen souls are delivered. \u015ar\u012b Baladeva appeared as \u015ar\u012b Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu during the advent of Lord Caitanya, and the great Lord Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu exhibited His causeless mercy by delivering a pair of extremely fallen souls, namely Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i. Therefore it is particularly mentioned herein that Balar\u0101ma is the protector of the devotees of the Lord. By His divine grace only one can approach the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus \u015ar\u012b Balar\u0101ma is the mercy incarnation of the Lord, manifested as the spiritual master, the savior of the pure devotees."

Are they all doing well in their respective functions? Do they, who are all eternally bound in friendship with us, remember our welfare?",
        "purport": " The constant companions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, such as Uddhava, are all liberated souls, and they descended along with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to this material world to fulfill the mission of the Lord. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are also liberated souls who descended along with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to serve Him in His transcendental pastimes on this earth. As stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.8), the Lord and His eternal associates, who are also liberated souls like the Lord, come down on this earth at certain intervals. The Lord remembers them all, but His associates, although liberated souls, forget due to their being ta\u1e6dasth\u0101-\u015bakti, or marginal potency of the Lord. That is the difference between the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva and j\u012bva-tattva. The j\u012bva-tattvas are infinitesimal potential particles of the Lord, and therefore they require the protection of the Lord at all times. And to the eternal servitors of the Lord, the Lord is pleased to give all protection at all times. The liberated souls never, therefore, think themselves as free as the Lord or as powerful as the Lord, but they always seek the protection of the Lord in all circumstances, both in the material world and in the spiritual world. This dependence of the liberated soul is constitutional, for the liberated souls are like sparks of a fire that are able to exhibit the glow of fire along with the fire and not independently. Independently the glow of the sparks is extinguished, although the quality of fire or the glowing is there. Thus those who give up the protection of the Lord and become so-called lords themselves, out of spiritual ignorance, come back again to this material world, even after prolonged tapasya of the severest type. That is the verdict of all Vedic literature."

        "purport": " Here in this particular verse the Lord is described as bhagav\u0101n, govinda, brahma\u1e47ya and bhakta-vatsala. He is bhagav\u0101n svayam, or the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, full with all opulences, all power, all knowledge, all beauty, all fame and all renunciation. No one is equal to or greater than Him. He is Govinda because He is the pleasure of the cows and the senses. Those who have purified their senses by the devotional service of the Lord can render unto Him real service and thereby derive transcendental pleasure out of such purified senses. Only the impure conditioned living being cannot derive any pleasure from the senses, but being illusioned by false pleasures of the senses, he becomes servant of the senses. Therefore, we need His protection for our own interest. The Lord is the protector of cows and the brahminical culture. A society devoid of cow protection and brahminical culture is not under the direct protection of the Lord, just as the prisoners in the jails are not under the protection of the king but under the protection of a severe agent of the king. Without cow protection and cultivation of the brahminical qualities in human society, at least for a section of the members of society, no human civilization can prosper at any length. By brahminical culture, the development of the dormant qualities of goodness, namely truthfulness, equanimity, sense control, forbearance, simplicity, general knowledge, transcendental knowledge and firm faith in the Vedic wisdom, one can become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and thus see the Lord as He is. And after surpassing the brahminical perfection, one has to become a devotee of the Lord so that His loving affection in the form of proprietor, master, friend, son and lover can be transcendentally achieved. The stage of a devotee, which attracts the transcendental affection of the Lord, does not develop unless one has developed the qualities of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a as above mentioned. The Lord is inclined to a br\u0101hma\u1e47a of quality and not of false prestige. Those who are less than a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by qualification cannot establish any relation with the Lord, just as fire cannot be kindled from the raw earth unless there is wood, although there is a relation between wood and the earth. Since the Lord is all-perfect in Himself, there could not be any question of His welfare, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira refrained from asking this question. He simply inquired about His residential place, Dv\u0101rak\u0101 Pur\u012b, where pious men assemble. The Lord stays only where pious men assemble and takes pleasure in their glorifying the Supreme Truth. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was anxious to know about the pious men and their pious acts in the city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101."

The K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has His own planet on the northern top of the universe, and there is a great ocean of milk where the Lord resides on the bed of the Ananta incarnation of Baladeva. Thus Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira has compared the Yadu dynasty to the Ocean of Milk and \u015ar\u012b Balar\u0101ma to the Ananta where Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a resides. He has compared the citizens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 to the liberated inhabitants of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas. Beyond the material sky, further than we can see with our eyes and beyond the sevenfold coverings of the universe, there is the Causal Ocean in which all the universes are floating like footballs, and beyond the Causal Ocean there is an unlimited span of spiritual sky generally known as the effulgence of Brahman. Within this effulgence there are innumerable spiritual planets, and they are known as the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Each and every Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet is many, many times bigger than the biggest universe within the material world, and in each of them there are innumerable inhabitants who look exactly like Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. These inhabitants are known as the Mah\u0101-pauru\u1e63ikas, or persons directly engaged in the service of the Lord. They are happy in those planets and are without any kind of misery, and they live perpetually in full youthfulness, enjoying life in full bliss and knowledge without fear of birth, death, old age or disease, and without the influence of k\u0101la, eternal time. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira has compared the inhabitants of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 to the Mah\u0101-pauru\u1e63ikas of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka because they are so happy with the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 there are many references to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas, and they are mentioned there as mad-dh\u0101ma, or the kingdom of the Lord."

Thus the queens enjoy things which are prerogatives of the wives of the controller of thunderbolts.",
        "purport": " Satyabh\u0101m\u0101: One of the principal queens of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at Dv\u0101rak\u0101. After killing Narak\u0101sura, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a visited the palace of Narak\u0101sura accompanied by Satyabh\u0101m\u0101. He went to Indraloka also with Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, and she was received by \u015aac\u012bdev\u012b, who introduced her to the mother of the demigods, Aditi. Aditi was very much pleased with Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, and she blessed her with the benediction of permanent youth as long as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remained on the earth. Aditi also took her with her to show her the special prerogatives of the demigods in the heavenly planets. When Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 saw the p\u0101rij\u0101ta flower, she desired to have it in her palace at Dv\u0101rak\u0101. After that, she came back to Dv\u0101rak\u0101 along with her husband and expressed her willingness to have the p\u0101rij\u0101ta flower at her palace. Satyabh\u0101m\u0101\u2019s palace was especially bedecked with valuable jewels, and even in the hottest season of summer the inside of the palace remained cool, as if air conditioned. She decorated her palace with various flags, heralding the news of her great husband\u2019s presence there. Once, along with her husband, she met Draupad\u012b, and she was anxious to be instructed by Draupad\u012b in the ways and means of pleasing her husband. Draupad\u012b was expert in this affair because she kept five husbands, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and all were very much pleased with her. On receipt of Draupad\u012b\u2019s instructions, she was very much pleased and offered her good wishes and returned to Dv\u0101rak\u0101. She was the daughter of Satr\u0101jit. After the departure of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, when Arjuna visited Dv\u0101rak\u0101, all the queens, including Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 and Rukmi\u1e47\u012b, lamented for the Lord with great feeling. At the last stage of her life, she left for the forest to undergo severe penance. Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 instigated her husband to get the p\u0101rij\u0101ta flower from the heavenly planets, and the Lord got it even by force from the demigods, as a common husband secures things to please his wife. As already explained, the Lord had very little to do with so many wives to carry out their orders like an ordinary man. But because the queens accepted the high quality of devotional service, namely administering the Lord all comforts, the Lord played the part of a faithful and complete husband. No earthly creature can expect to have things from the heavenly kingdom, especially the p\u0101rij\u0101ta flowers, which are simply to be used by the demigods. But due to their becoming the Lord\u2019s faithful wives, all of them enjoyed the special prerogatives of the great wives of the denizens of heaven. In other words, since the Lord is the proprietor of everything within His creation, it is not very astonishing for the queens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 to have any rare thing from any part of the universe."

And therefore their feet trample over the Sudharm\u0101 assembly house, which the best demigods deserved but which was taken away from them.",
        "purport": " Those who are directly servitors of the Lord are protected by the Lord from all fearfulness, and they also enjoy the best of things, even if they are forcibly accumulated. The Lord is equal in behavior to all living beings, but He is partial to His pure devotees, being very affectionate toward them. The city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 was flourishing, being enriched with the best of things in the material world. The state assembly house is constructed according to the dignity of the particular state. In the heavenly planets, the state assembly house called Sudharm\u0101 was deserving of the dignity of the best of the demigods. Such an assembly house is never meant for any state on the globe because the human being on the earth is unable to construct it, however far a particular state may be materially advanced. But during the time of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s presence on the earth, the members of the Yadu family forcibly brought the celestial assembly house to earth and placed it at Dv\u0101rak\u0101. They were able to use such force because they were certain of the indulgence and protection of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, the Lord is provided with the best things in the universe by His pure devotees. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was provided with all kinds of comforts and facilities available within the universe by the members of the Yadu dynasty, and in return such servitors of the Lord were protected and fearless. A forgetful, conditioned soul is fearful. But a liberated soul is never fearful, just as a small child completely dependent on the mercy of his father is never fearful of anyone. Fearfulness is a sort of illusion for the living being when he is in slumber and forgetting his eternal relation with the Lord. Since the living being is never to die by his constitution, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.20), then what is the cause of fearfulness? A person may be fearful of a tiger in a dream, but another man who is awake by his side sees no tiger there. The tiger is a myth for both of them, namely the person dreaming and the person awake, because actually there is no tiger; but the man forgetful of his awakened life is fearful, whereas the man who has not forgotten his position is not at all fearful. Thus the members of the Yadu dynasty were fully awake in their service to the Lord, and therefore there was no tiger for them to be afraid of at any time. Even if there were a real tiger, the Lord was there to protect them."

        "translation": "Have you contacted a woman of impeachable character, or have you not properly treated a deserving woman? Or have you been defeated on the way by someone who is inferior or equal to you?",
        "purport": " It appears from this verse that during the time of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas free contact between man and woman was allowed in certain conditions only. The higher-caste men, namely the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas, could accept a woman of the vai\u015bya or the \u015b\u016bdra community, but a man from the lower castes could not contact a woman of the higher caste. Even a k\u1e63atriya could not contact a woman of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a caste. The wife of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is considered one of the seven mothers (namely one\u2019s own mother, the wife of the spiritual master or teacher, the wife of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the wife of a king, the cow, the nurse and the earth). Such contact between man and woman was known as uttama and adhama. Contact of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a with a k\u1e63atriya woman is uttama, but the contact of a k\u1e63atriya with a br\u0101hma\u1e47a woman is adhama and therefore condemned. A woman approaching a man for contact should never be refused, but at the same time the discretion as above mentioned may also be considered. Bh\u012bma was approached by Hi\u1e0dimb\u012b from a community lower than the \u015b\u016bdras, and Yay\u0101ti refused to marry the daughter of \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya because of \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s being a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Vy\u0101sadeva, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, was called to beget P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du and Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. Satyavat\u012b belonged to a family of fishermen, but Par\u0101\u015bara, a great br\u0101hma\u1e47a, begot in her Vy\u0101sadeva. So there are so many examples of contacts with woman, but in all cases the contacts were not abominable nor were the results of such contacts bad. Contact between man and woman is natural, but that also must be carried out under regulative principles so that social consecration may not be disturbed or unwanted worthless population be increased for the unrest of the world. It is abominable for a k\u1e63atriya to be defeated by one who is inferior in strength or equal in strength. If one is defeated at all, he should be defeated by some superior power. Arjuna was defeated by Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a saved him from the danger. This was not an insult for Arjuna because Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was far superior to Arjuna in all ways, namely age, respect and strength. But Kar\u1e47a was equal to Arjuna, and therefore Arjuna was in crisis when fighting with Kar\u1e47a. It was felt by Arjuna, and therefore Kar\u1e47a was killed even by crooked means. Such are the engagements of the k\u1e63atriyas, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira inquired from his brother whether anything undesirable happened on the way home from Dv\u0101rak\u0101."
