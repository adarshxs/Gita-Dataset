Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it knew all this, and thus he concluded that his insulting a powerful br\u0101hma\u1e47a was certainly to be punished by the laws of the Lord, and he was expecting something very difficult in the very near future. He therefore desired the imminent calamity to fall on him and not on his family members. A man\u2019s personal misconduct affects all his family members. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it desired the calamity to fall on him alone. By suffering personally he would be restrained from future sins, and at the same time the sin which he had committed would be counteracted so that his descendants would not suffer. That is the way a responsible devotee thinks. The family members of a devotee also share the effects of a devotee\u2019s service unto the Lord. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Prahl\u0101da saved his demon father by his personal devotional service. A devotee son in the family is the greatest boon or blessing of the Lord."

He decided to prepare himself for his imminent death and find out the way to go back to Godhead. The life of a human being is a chance to prepare oneself to go back to Godhead, or to get rid of the material existence, the repetition of birth and death. Thus in the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma every man and woman is trained for this purpose. In other words, the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma is known also as san\u0101tana-dharma, or the eternal occupation. The system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma prepares a man for going back to Godhead, and thus a householder is ordered to go to the forest as a v\u0101naprastha to acquire complete knowledge and then to take sanny\u0101sa prior to his inevitable death. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was fortunate to get a seven-day notice to meet his inevitable death. But for the common man there is no definite notice, although death is inevitable for all. Foolish men forget this sure fact of death and neglect the duty of preparing themselves for going back to Godhead. They spoil their lives in animal propensities to eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. Such an irresponsible life is adopted by the people in the Age of Kali because of a sinful desire to condemn brahminical culture, God consciousness and cow protection, for which the state is responsible. The state must employ revenue to advance these three items and thus educate the populace to prepare for death. The state which does so is the real welfare state. The state of India should better follow the examples of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, the ideal executive head, than to imitate other materialistic states which have no idea of the kingdom of Godhead, the ultimate goal of human life. Deterioration of the ideals of Indian civilization has brought about the deterioration of civic life, not only in India but also abroad."

This earth is one of the innumerable material planets within the universe, and there are innumerable universes also within the compass of the mahat-tattva. The devotees are told by the Lord and His representatives, the spiritual masters or \u0101c\u0101ryas, that not one of the planets within all the innumerable universes is suitable for the residential purposes of a devotee. The devotee always desires to go back home, back to Godhead, just to become one of the associates of the Lord in the capacity of servitor, friend, parent or conjugal lover of the Lord, either in one of the innumerable Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the planet of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All these planets are eternally situated in the spiritual sky, the paravyoma, which is on the other side of the Causal Ocean within the mahat-tattva. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was already aware of all this information due to his accumulated piety and birth in a high family of devotees, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, and thus he was not at all interested in the material planets. Modern scientists are very eager to reach the moon by material arrangements, but they cannot conceive of the highest planet of this universe. But a devotee like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it does not care a fig for the moon or, for that matter, any of the material planets. So when he was assured of his death on a fixed date, he became more determined in the transcendental loving service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by complete fasting on the bank of the transcendental river Yamun\u0101, which flows down by the capital of Hastin\u0101pura (in the Delhi state). Both the Ganges and the Yamun\u0101 are amarty\u0101 (transcendental) rivers, and the Yamun\u0101 is still more sanctified for the following reasons."

Therefore that water sanctifies the three worlds inside and outside and even sanctifies Lord \u015aiva and other demigods. Consequently everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river.",
        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, just after receiving the news of his death within seven days, at once retired from family life and shifted himself to the sacred bank of the Yamun\u0101 River. Generally it is said that the King took shelter on the bank of the Ganges, but according to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the King took shelter on the bank of the Yamun\u0101. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s statement appears to be more accurate because of the geographical situation. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it resided in his capital Hastin\u0101pura, situated near present Delhi, and the river Yamun\u0101 flows down past the city. Naturally the King would take shelter of the river Yamun\u0101 because she was flowing past his palace door. And as far as sanctity is concerned, the river Yamun\u0101 is more directly connected with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a than the Ganges. The Lord sanctified the river Yamun\u0101 from the beginning of His transcendental pastimes in the world. While His father Vasudeva was crossing the Yamun\u0101 with the baby Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for a safe place at Gokula on the other bank of the river from Mathur\u0101, the Lord fell down in the river, and by the dust of His lotus feet the river at once became sanctified. It is especially mentioned herein that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it took shelter of that particular river which is beautifully flowing, carrying the dust of the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, mixed with tulas\u012b leaves. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet are always besmeared with the tulas\u012b leaves, and thus as soon as His lotus feet contact the water of the Ganges and the Yamun\u0101, the rivers become at once sanctified. The Lord, however, contacted the river Yamun\u0101 more than the Ganges. According to the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a, as quoted by \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, there is no difference between the water of the Ganges and the Yamun\u0101, but when the water of the Ganges is sanctified one hundred times, it is called the Yamun\u0101. Similarly, it is said in the scriptures that one thousand names of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are equal to one name of R\u0101ma, and three names of Lord R\u0101ma are equal to one name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

So, freeing himself from all kinds of associations and attachments, he accepted the vows of a sage.",
        "purport": " The water of the Ganges sanctifies all the three worlds, including the gods and the demigods, because it emanates from the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the fountainhead of the principle of vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, and therefore shelter of His lotus feet can deliver one from all sins, including an offense committed by a king unto a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, therefore, decided to meditate upon the lotus feet of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is Mukunda, or the giver of liberations of all description. The banks of the Ganges or the Yamun\u0101 give one a chance to remember the Lord continuously. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it freed himself from all sorts of material association and meditated upon the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is the way of liberation. To be free from all material association means to cease completely from committing any further sins. To meditate upon the lotus feet of the Lord means to become free from the effects of all previous sins. The conditions of the material world are so made that one has to commit sins willingly or unwillingly, and the best example is Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it himself, who was a recognized sinless, pious king. But he also became a victim of an offense, even though he was ever unwilling to commit such a mistake. He was cursed also, but because he was a great devotee of the Lord, even such reverses of life became favorable. The principle is that one should not willingly commit any sin in his life and should constantly remember the lotus feet of the Lord without deviation. Only in such a mood will the Lord help the devotee make regular progress toward the path of liberation and thus attain the lotus feet of the Lord. Even if there are accidental sins committed by the devotee, the Lord saves the surrendered soul from all sins, as confirmed in all scriptures."

G\u0101dhi-suta, or Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra: A great sage of austerity and mystic power. He is famous as G\u0101dhi-suta because his father was G\u0101dhi, a powerful king of the province of Kany\u0101kubja (part of Uttara Pradesh). Although he was a k\u1e63atriya by birth, he became a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in the very same body by the power of his spiritual achievements. He picked a quarrel with Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni when he was a k\u1e63atriya king and performed a great sacrifice in cooperation with Ma\u1e6da\u1e45ga Muni and thus was able to vanquish the sons of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. He became a great yog\u012b, and yet he failed to check his senses and thus was obliged to become the father of \u015aakuntal\u0101, the beauty queen of world history. Once, when he was a k\u1e63atriya king, he visited the hermitage of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni, and he was given a royal reception. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra wanted from Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha a cow named Nandin\u012b, and the Muni refused to deliver it.

Bh\u1e5bgu: When Brahm\u0101j\u012b was performing a great sacrifice on behalf of Varu\u1e47a, Mahar\u1e63i Bh\u1e5bgu was born from the sacrificial fire. He was a great sage, and his very dear wife was Pulom\u0101. He could travel in space like Durv\u0101s\u0101, N\u0101rada and others, and he used to visit all the planets of the universe. Before the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, he tried to stop the battle. Sometimes he instructed Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja Muni about astronomical evolution, and he is the author of the great Bh\u1e5bgu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the great astrological calculation. He explained how air, fire, water and earth are generated from ether. He explained how the air in the stomach works and regulates the intestines. As a great philosopher, he logically established the eternity of the living entity (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata). He was also a great anthropologist, and the theory of evolution was long ago explained by him. He was a scientific propounder of the four divisions and orders of human society known as the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution. He converted the k\u1e63atriya king V\u012btahavya into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha: See \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 1.9.6. Par\u0101\u015bara: He is the grandson of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni and father of Vy\u0101sadeva. He is the son of Mahar\u1e63i \u015aakti, and his mother\u2019s name was Ad\u1e5b\u015byat\u012b. He was in the womb of his mother when she was only twelve years old. And from within the womb of his mother he learned the Vedas. His father was killed by a demon, Kalm\u0101\u1e63ap\u0101da, and to avenge this he wanted to annihilate the whole world. He was restrained, however, by his grandfather Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. He then performed a R\u0101k\u1e63asa-killing yaj\u00f1a, but Mahar\u1e63i Pulastya restrained him. He begot Vy\u0101sadeva, being attracted by Satyavat\u012b, who was to become the wife of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015a\u0101ntanu. By the blessings of Par\u0101\u015bara, Satyavat\u012b became fragrant for miles. He was present also during the time of Bh\u012b\u1e63ma\u2019s death. He was the spiritual master of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Janaka and a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva. He is the author of many Vedic scriptures and sociological directions. G\u0101dhi-suta, or Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra: A great sage of austerity and mystic power. He is famous as G\u0101dhi-suta because his father was G\u0101dhi, a powerful king of the province of Kany\u0101kubja (part of Uttara Pradesh). Although he was a k\u1e63atriya by birth, he became a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in the very same body by the power of his spiritual achievements. He picked a quarrel with Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni when he was a k\u1e63atriya king and performed a great sacrifice in cooperation with Ma\u1e6da\u1e45ga Muni and thus was able to vanquish the sons of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. He became a great yog\u012b, and yet he failed to check his senses and thus was obliged to become the father of \u015aakuntal\u0101, the beauty queen of world history. Once, when he was a k\u1e63atriya king, he visited the hermitage of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni, and he was given a royal reception. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra wanted from Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha a cow named Nandin\u012b, and the Muni refused to deliver it. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra stole the cow, and thus there was a quarrel between the sage and the King. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was defeated by the spiritual strength of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, and thus the King decided to become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Before becoming a br\u0101hma\u1e47a he underwent severe austerity on the bank of the Kau\u015bika. He was also one who tried to stop the Kuruk\u1e63etra war. A\u1e45gir\u0101: He is one of the six mental sons of Brahm\u0101 and the father of B\u1e5bhaspati, the great learned priest of the demigods in the heavenly planets. He was born of the semen of Brahm\u0101j\u012b given to a cinder of fire. Utathya and Sa\u1e41varta are his sons. It is said that he is still performing austerity and chanting the holy name of the Lord at a place known as Alok\u0101nanda on the banks of the Ganges."

        "purport": " Cyavana: A great sage and one of the sons of Bh\u1e5bgu Muni. He was born prematurely when his pregnant mother was kidnapped. Cyavana is one of the six sons of his father. Bh\u1e5bgu: When Brahm\u0101j\u012b was performing a great sacrifice on behalf of Varu\u1e47a, Mahar\u1e63i Bh\u1e5bgu was born from the sacrificial fire. He was a great sage, and his very dear wife was Pulom\u0101. He could travel in space like Durv\u0101s\u0101, N\u0101rada and others, and he used to visit all the planets of the universe. Before the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, he tried to stop the battle. Sometimes he instructed Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja Muni about astronomical evolution, and he is the author of the great Bh\u1e5bgu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the great astrological calculation. He explained how air, fire, water and earth are generated from ether. He explained how the air in the stomach works and regulates the intestines. As a great philosopher, he logically established the eternity of the living entity (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata). He was also a great anthropologist, and the theory of evolution was long ago explained by him. He was a scientific propounder of the four divisions and orders of human society known as the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution. He converted the k\u1e63atriya king V\u012btahavya into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha: See \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 1.9.6. Par\u0101\u015bara: He is the grandson of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni and father of Vy\u0101sadeva. He is the son of Mahar\u1e63i \u015aakti, and his mother\u2019s name was Ad\u1e5b\u015byat\u012b. He was in the womb of his mother when she was only twelve years old. And from within the womb of his mother he learned the Vedas. His father was killed by a demon, Kalm\u0101\u1e63ap\u0101da, and to avenge this he wanted to annihilate the whole world. He was restrained, however, by his grandfather Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. He then performed a R\u0101k\u1e63asa-killing yaj\u00f1a, but Mahar\u1e63i Pulastya restrained him. He begot Vy\u0101sadeva, being attracted by Satyavat\u012b, who was to become the wife of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015a\u0101ntanu. By the blessings of Par\u0101\u015bara, Satyavat\u012b became fragrant for miles. He was present also during the time of Bh\u012b\u1e63ma\u2019s death. He was the spiritual master of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Janaka and a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva. He is the author of many Vedic scriptures and sociological directions. G\u0101dhi-suta, or Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra: A great sage of austerity and mystic power. He is famous as G\u0101dhi-suta because his father was G\u0101dhi, a powerful king of the province of Kany\u0101kubja (part of Uttara Pradesh). Although he was a k\u1e63atriya by birth, he became a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in the very same body by the power of his spiritual achievements. He picked a quarrel with Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni when he was a k\u1e63atriya king and performed a great sacrifice in cooperation with Ma\u1e6da\u1e45ga Muni and thus was able to vanquish the sons of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. He became a great yog\u012b, and yet he failed to check his senses and thus was obliged to become the father of \u015aakuntal\u0101, the beauty queen of world history. Once, when he was a k\u1e63atriya king, he visited the hermitage of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni, and he was given a royal reception. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra wanted from Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha a cow named Nandin\u012b, and the Muni refused to deliver it. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra stole the cow, and thus there was a quarrel between the sage and the King. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was defeated by the spiritual strength of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, and thus the King decided to become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Before becoming a br\u0101hma\u1e47a he underwent severe austerity on the bank of the Kau\u015bika. He was also one who tried to stop the Kuruk\u1e63etra war. A\u1e45gir\u0101: He is one of the six mental sons of Brahm\u0101 and the father of B\u1e5bhaspati, the great learned priest of the demigods in the heavenly planets. He was born of the semen of Brahm\u0101j\u012b given to a cinder of fire. Utathya and Sa\u1e41varta are his sons. It is said that he is still performing austerity and chanting the holy name of the Lord at a place known as Alok\u0101nanda on the banks of the Ganges. Para\u015bur\u0101ma: See \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 1.9.6. Utathya: One of the three sons of Mahar\u1e63i A\u1e45gir\u0101. He was the spiritual master of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Mandh\u0101t\u0101. He married Bhadr\u0101, the daughter of Soma (moon). Varu\u1e47a kidnapped his wife Bhadr\u0101, and to retaliate the offense of the god of water, he drank all the water of the world."

        "purport": " Cyavana: A great sage and one of the sons of Bh\u1e5bgu Muni. He was born prematurely when his pregnant mother was kidnapped. Cyavana is one of the six sons of his father. Bh\u1e5bgu: When Brahm\u0101j\u012b was performing a great sacrifice on behalf of Varu\u1e47a, Mahar\u1e63i Bh\u1e5bgu was born from the sacrificial fire. He was a great sage, and his very dear wife was Pulom\u0101. He could travel in space like Durv\u0101s\u0101, N\u0101rada and others, and he used to visit all the planets of the universe. Before the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, he tried to stop the battle. Sometimes he instructed Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja Muni about astronomical evolution, and he is the author of the great Bh\u1e5bgu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the great astrological calculation. He explained how air, fire, water and earth are generated from ether. He explained how the air in the stomach works and regulates the intestines. As a great philosopher, he logically established the eternity of the living entity (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata). He was also a great anthropologist, and the theory of evolution was long ago explained by him. He was a scientific propounder of the four divisions and orders of human society known as the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution. He converted the k\u1e63atriya king V\u012btahavya into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha: See \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 1.9.6. Par\u0101\u015bara: He is the grandson of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni and father of Vy\u0101sadeva. He is the son of Mahar\u1e63i \u015aakti, and his mother\u2019s name was Ad\u1e5b\u015byat\u012b. He was in the womb of his mother when she was only twelve years old. And from within the womb of his mother he learned the Vedas. His father was killed by a demon, Kalm\u0101\u1e63ap\u0101da, and to avenge this he wanted to annihilate the whole world. He was restrained, however, by his grandfather Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. He then performed a R\u0101k\u1e63asa-killing yaj\u00f1a, but Mahar\u1e63i Pulastya restrained him. He begot Vy\u0101sadeva, being attracted by Satyavat\u012b, who was to become the wife of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015a\u0101ntanu. By the blessings of Par\u0101\u015bara, Satyavat\u012b became fragrant for miles. He was present also during the time of Bh\u012b\u1e63ma\u2019s death. He was the spiritual master of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Janaka and a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva. He is the author of many Vedic scriptures and sociological directions. G\u0101dhi-suta, or Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra: A great sage of austerity and mystic power. He is famous as G\u0101dhi-suta because his father was G\u0101dhi, a powerful king of the province of Kany\u0101kubja (part of Uttara Pradesh). Although he was a k\u1e63atriya by birth, he became a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in the very same body by the power of his spiritual achievements. He picked a quarrel with Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni when he was a k\u1e63atriya king and performed a great sacrifice in cooperation with Ma\u1e6da\u1e45ga Muni and thus was able to vanquish the sons of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. He became a great yog\u012b, and yet he failed to check his senses and thus was obliged to become the father of \u015aakuntal\u0101, the beauty queen of world history. Once, when he was a k\u1e63atriya king, he visited the hermitage of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni, and he was given a royal reception. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra wanted from Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha a cow named Nandin\u012b, and the Muni refused to deliver it. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra stole the cow, and thus there was a quarrel between the sage and the King. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was defeated by the spiritual strength of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, and thus the King decided to become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Before becoming a br\u0101hma\u1e47a he underwent severe austerity on the bank of the Kau\u015bika. He was also one who tried to stop the Kuruk\u1e63etra war. A\u1e45gir\u0101: He is one of the six mental sons of Brahm\u0101 and the father of B\u1e5bhaspati, the great learned priest of the demigods in the heavenly planets. He was born of the semen of Brahm\u0101j\u012b given to a cinder of fire. Utathya and Sa\u1e41varta are his sons. It is said that he is still performing austerity and chanting the holy name of the Lord at a place known as Alok\u0101nanda on the banks of the Ganges. Para\u015bur\u0101ma: See \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 1.9.6. Utathya: One of the three sons of Mahar\u1e63i A\u1e45gir\u0101. He was the spiritual master of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Mandh\u0101t\u0101. He married Bhadr\u0101, the daughter of Soma (moon). Varu\u1e47a kidnapped his wife Bhadr\u0101, and to retaliate the offense of the god of water, he drank all the water of the world. Medh\u0101tithi: An old sage of yore. An assembly member of the heavenly King Indradeva. His son was Ka\u1e47va Muni, who brought up \u015aakuntal\u0101 in the forest. He was promoted to the heavenly planet by strictly following the principles of retired life (v\u0101naprastha). Devala: A great authority like N\u0101rada Muni and Vy\u0101sadeva. His good name is on the list of authorities mentioned in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 when Arjuna acknowledged Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He met Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira after the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and he was the elder brother of Dhaumya, the priest of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava family. Like the k\u1e63atriyas, he also allowed his daughter to select her own husband in a svaya\u1e41vara meeting, and at that ceremony all the bachelor sons of the \u1e5b\u1e63is were invited. According to some, he is not Asita Devala."

Bh\u1e5bgu: When Brahm\u0101j\u012b was performing a great sacrifice on behalf of Varu\u1e47a, Mahar\u1e63i Bh\u1e5bgu was born from the sacrificial fire. He was a great sage, and his very dear wife was Pulom\u0101. He could travel in space like Durv\u0101s\u0101, N\u0101rada and others, and he used to visit all the planets of the universe. Before the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, he tried to stop the battle. Sometimes he instructed Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja Muni about astronomical evolution, and he is the author of the great Bh\u1e5bgu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the great astrological calculation. He explained how air, fire, water and earth are generated from ether. He explained how the air in the stomach works and regulates the intestines. As a great philosopher, he logically established the eternity of the living entity (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata). He was also a great anthropologist, and the theory of evolution was long ago explained by him. He was a scientific propounder of the four divisions and orders of human society known as the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution. He converted the k\u1e63atriya king V\u012btahavya into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha: See \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 1.9.6. Par\u0101\u015bara: He is the grandson of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni and father of Vy\u0101sadeva. He is the son of Mahar\u1e63i \u015aakti, and his mother\u2019s name was Ad\u1e5b\u015byat\u012b. He was in the womb of his mother when she was only twelve years old. And from within the womb of his mother he learned the Vedas. His father was killed by a demon, Kalm\u0101\u1e63ap\u0101da, and to avenge this he wanted to annihilate the whole world. He was restrained, however, by his grandfather Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. He then performed a R\u0101k\u1e63asa-killing yaj\u00f1a, but Mahar\u1e63i Pulastya restrained him. He begot Vy\u0101sadeva, being attracted by Satyavat\u012b, who was to become the wife of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015a\u0101ntanu. By the blessings of Par\u0101\u015bara, Satyavat\u012b became fragrant for miles. He was present also during the time of Bh\u012b\u1e63ma\u2019s death. He was the spiritual master of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Janaka and a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva. He is the author of many Vedic scriptures and sociological directions. G\u0101dhi-suta, or Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra: A great sage of austerity and mystic power. He is famous as G\u0101dhi-suta because his father was G\u0101dhi, a powerful king of the province of Kany\u0101kubja (part of Uttara Pradesh). Although he was a k\u1e63atriya by birth, he became a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in the very same body by the power of his spiritual achievements. He picked a quarrel with Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni when he was a k\u1e63atriya king and performed a great sacrifice in cooperation with Ma\u1e6da\u1e45ga Muni and thus was able to vanquish the sons of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. He became a great yog\u012b, and yet he failed to check his senses and thus was obliged to become the father of \u015aakuntal\u0101, the beauty queen of world history. Once, when he was a k\u1e63atriya king, he visited the hermitage of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni, and he was given a royal reception. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra wanted from Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha a cow named Nandin\u012b, and the Muni refused to deliver it. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra stole the cow, and thus there was a quarrel between the sage and the King. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was defeated by the spiritual strength of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, and thus the King decided to become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Before becoming a br\u0101hma\u1e47a he underwent severe austerity on the bank of the Kau\u015bika. He was also one who tried to stop the Kuruk\u1e63etra war. A\u1e45gir\u0101: He is one of the six mental sons of Brahm\u0101 and the father of B\u1e5bhaspati, the great learned priest of the demigods in the heavenly planets. He was born of the semen of Brahm\u0101j\u012b given to a cinder of fire. Utathya and Sa\u1e41varta are his sons. It is said that he is still performing austerity and chanting the holy name of the Lord at a place known as Alok\u0101nanda on the banks of the Ganges. Para\u015bur\u0101ma: See \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 1.9.6. Utathya: One of the three sons of Mahar\u1e63i A\u1e45gir\u0101. He was the spiritual master of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Mandh\u0101t\u0101. He married Bhadr\u0101, the daughter of Soma (moon). Varu\u1e47a kidnapped his wife Bhadr\u0101, and to retaliate the offense of the god of water, he drank all the water of the world. Medh\u0101tithi: An old sage of yore. An assembly member of the heavenly King Indradeva. His son was Ka\u1e47va Muni, who brought up \u015aakuntal\u0101 in the forest. He was promoted to the heavenly planet by strictly following the principles of retired life (v\u0101naprastha). Devala: A great authority like N\u0101rada Muni and Vy\u0101sadeva. His good name is on the list of authorities mentioned in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 when Arjuna acknowledged Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He met Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira after the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and he was the elder brother of Dhaumya, the priest of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava family. Like the k\u1e63atriyas, he also allowed his daughter to select her own husband in a svaya\u1e41vara meeting, and at that ceremony all the bachelor sons of the \u1e5b\u1e63is were invited. According to some, he is not Asita Devala. Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja: See \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 1.9.6. Gautama: One of the seven great sages of the universe. \u015aaradv\u0101n Gautama was one of his sons. Persons in the Gautama-gotra (dynasty) today are either his family descendants or in his disciplic succession. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as who profess Gautama-gotra are generally family descendants, and the k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas who profess Gautama-gotra are all in the line of his disciplic succession. He was the husband of the famous Ahaly\u0101 who turned into stone when Indradeva, the King of the heaven, molested her. Ahaly\u0101 was delivered by Lord R\u0101macandra. Gautama was the grandfather of K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya, one of the heroes of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra."

Gautama: One of the seven great sages of the universe. \u015aaradv\u0101n Gautama was one of his sons. Persons in the Gautama-gotra (dynasty) today are either his family descendants or in his disciplic succession. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as who profess Gautama-gotra are generally family descendants, and the k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas who profess Gautama-gotra are all in the line of his disciplic succession. He was the husband of the famous Ahaly\u0101 who turned into stone when Indradeva, the King of the heaven, molested her. Ahaly\u0101 was delivered by Lord R\u0101macandra. Gautama was the grandfather of K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya, one of the heroes of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Maitreya: A great \u1e5b\u1e63i of yore. He was the spiritual master of Vidura and a great religious authority. He advised Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra to keep good relations with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. Duryodhana disagreed and thus was cursed by him. He met Vy\u0101sadeva and had religious discourses with him."

        "purport": " According to religious principles, stool, urine, wash water, etc., must be left at a long distance. Attached bathrooms, urinals, etc., may be very convenient amenities of modern civilization, but they are ordered to be situated at a distance from residential quarters. That very example is cited herein in relation to the kingly order for those who are progressively marching back to Godhead. Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said that to be in intimate touch with dollars-and-cents men, or the kingly order, is worse than suicide for one who desires to go back to Godhead. In other words, the transcendentalists do not generally associate with men who are too enamored by the external beauty of God\u2019s creation. By advanced knowledge in spiritual realization, the transcendentalist knows that this beautiful material world is nothing but a shadowy reflection of the reality, the kingdom of God. They are not, therefore, very much captivated by royal opulence or anything like that. But in the case of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, the situation was different. Apparently the King was condemned to death by an inexperienced br\u0101hma\u1e47a boy, but factually he was called by the Lord to return to Him. Other transcendentalists, the great sages and mystics who assembled together because of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it\u2019s fasting unto death, were quite anxious to see him, for he was going back to Godhead. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it also could understand that the great sages who assembled there were all kind to his forefathers, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, because of their devotional service to the Lord. He therefore felt grateful to the sages for being present there at the last stage of his life, and he felt that it was all due to the greatness of his late forefathers or grandfathers. He felt proud, therefore, that he happened to be the descendant of such great devotees. Such pride for the devotees of the Lord is certainly not equal to the puffed-up sense of vanity for material prosperity. The first is reality, whereas the other is false and vain."

        "purport": " That a devotee of the Lord is the only perfect living being is explained herein by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. A devotee of the Lord is no one\u2019s enemy, although there may be many enemies of a devotee. A devotee of the Lord does not like to associate with nondevotees, although he has no enmity with them. He desires association with the devotees of the Lord. This is perfectly natural because birds of the same feather mix together. And the most important function of a devotee is to have complete attachment for Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the father of all living beings. As a good son of the father behaves in a friendly way with all his other brothers, so also the devotee of the Lord, being a good son of the supreme father, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, sees all other living beings in relation with the supreme father. He tries to bring back the upstart sons of the father to a saner stage and to get them to accept the supreme fatherhood of God. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was certainly going back to Godhead, but even if he were not to go back, he prayed for a pattern of life which is the most perfect way in the material world. A pure devotee does not desire the company of a personality as great as Brahm\u0101, but he prefers the association of a petty living being, provided he is a devotee of the Lord."

When a great devotee of the Lord passes away, there is nothing to be lamented because the devotee is destined to enter into the kingdom of God. But the sorry plight is that such great devotees leave our sight, and therefore there is every reason to be sorry. As the Lord is rarely to be seen by our present eyes, so also are the great devotees. The great \u1e5b\u1e63is, therefore, correctly decided to remain on the spot till the last moment."

In the material world these attributes (up to seventy-eight percent of the Lord\u2019s attributes) are covered by the material energy, as the sun is covered by a cloud. The covered strength of the sun is very dim, compared to the original glare, and similarly the original color of the living beings with such attributes becomes almost extinct. There are three planetary systems, namely the lower worlds, the intermediate worlds and the upper worlds. The human beings on earth are situated at the beginning of the intermediate worlds, but living beings like Brahm\u0101 and his contemporaries live in the upper worlds, of which the topmost is Satyaloka. In Satyaloka the inhabitants are fully cognizant of Vedic wisdom, and thus the mystic cloud of material energy is cleared. Therefore they are known as the Vedas personified. Such persons, being fully aware of knowledge both mundane and transcendental, have no interest in either the mundane or transcendental worlds. They are practically desireless devotees. In the mundane world they have nothing to achieve, and in the transcendental world they are full in themselves. Then why do they come to the mundane world? They descend to different planets as messiahs by the order of the Lord to deliver the fallen souls. On the earth they come down and do good to the people of the world in different circumstances under different climatic influences. They have nothing to do in this world save and except reclaim the fallen souls rotting in material existence, deluded by material energy."

        "purport": " In this verse the King has placed two questions before the learned sages. The first question is what is the duty of everyone in all circumstances, and the second question is what is the specific duty of one who is to die very shortly. Out of the two, the question relating to the dying man is most important because everyone is a dying man, either very shortly or after one hundred years. The duration of life is immaterial, but the duty of a dying man is very important. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it placed these two questions before \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b also on his arrival, and practically the whole of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, beginning from the Second Canto up to the last, the Twelfth Canto, deals with these two questions. The conclusion arrived at thereof is that devotional service of the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as it is confirmed by the Lord Himself in the last phases of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is the last word in relation to everyone\u2019s permanent duty in life. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was already aware of this fact, but he wanted the great sages assembled there to unanimously give their verdict on his conviction so that he might be able to go on with his confirmed duty without controversy. He has especially mentioned the word \u015buddha, or perfectly correct. For transcendental realization or self-realization, many processes are recommended by various classes of philosophers. Some of them are first-class methods, and some of them are second- or third-class methods. The first-class method demands that one give up all other methods and surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord and thus be saved from all sins and their reactions."

He did not manifest any symptoms of belonging to any social order or status of life. He was surrounded with women and children, and he dressed as if others had neglected him.",
        "purport": " The word bhagav\u0101n is sometimes used in relation with some of the great devotees of the Lord, like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. Such liberated souls are disinterested in the affairs of this material world because they are self-satisfied by the great achievements of devotional service. As explained before, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b never accepted any formal spiritual master, nor did he undergo any formal reformatory performances. His father, Vy\u0101sadeva, was his natural spiritual master because \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b heard \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from him. After this, he became completely self-satisfied. Thus he was not dependent on any formal process. The formal processes are necessary for those who are expected to reach the stage of complete liberation, but \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was already in that status by the grace of his father. As a young boy he was expected to be properly dressed, but he went about naked and was uninterested in social customs. He was neglected by the general populace, and inquisitive boys and women surrounded him as if he were a madman. He thus appears on the scene while traveling on the earth of his own accord. It appears that upon the inquiry of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, the great sages were not unanimous in their decision as to what was to be done. For spiritual salvation there were many prescriptions according to the different modes of different persons. But the ultimate aim of life is to attain the highest perfectional stage of devotional service to the Lord. As doctors differ, so also sages differ in their different prescriptions. While such things were going on, the great and powerful son of Vy\u0101sadeva appeared on the scene."

The scriptural injunction is that one should humbly approach a spiritual master to understand the transcendental science. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was now prepared for meeting his death, and within the very short time of seven days he was to know the process of entering the kingdom of God. In such important cases, one is required to approach a spiritual master. There is no necessity of approaching a spiritual master unless one is in need of solving the problems of life. One who does not know how to put questions before the spiritual master has no business seeing him. And the qualification of the spiritual master is perfectly manifested in the person of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. Both the spiritual master and the disciple, namely \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, attained perfection through the medium of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b learned \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from his father, Vy\u0101sadeva, but he had no chance to recite it.

Generally people are attached to family matters, and the whole economic impetus of human society is moving under the influence of family affection. Such deluded persons have no information that one can render better service to the family by becoming a devotee of the Lord. The Lord gives special protection to the family members and descendants of a devotee, even though such members are themselves nondevotees! Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Prahl\u0101da was a great devotee of the Lord, but his father, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, was a great atheist and declared enemy of the Lord. But despite all this, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was awarded salvation due to his being the father of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Prahl\u0101da. The Lord is so kind that he gives all protection to the family members of His devotee, and thus the devotee has no need to bother about his family members, even if one leaves such family members aside to discharge devotional service. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and his brothers were the sons of Kunt\u012b, the paternal aunt of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it admits the patronage of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because of his being the only grandson of the great P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas."

One can achieve the nucleus of the devotional service of the Lord by the mercy of the spiritual master and the Personality of Godhead. The spiritual master is the manifested representative of the Lord to help one achieve ultimate success. One who is not authorized by the Lord cannot become a spiritual master. \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b is an authorized spiritual master, and thus he was inspired by the Lord to appear before Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it and instruct him in the teachings of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. One can achieve the ultimate success of going back to Godhead if he is favored by the Lord\u2019s sending His true representative. As soon as a true representative of the Lord is met by a devotee of the Lord, the devotee is assured a guarantee for going back to Godhead just after leaving the present body. This, however, depends on the sincerity of the devotee himself. The Lord is seated in the heart of all living beings, and thus he knows very well the movements of all individual persons. As soon as the Lord finds that a particular soul is very eager to go back to Godhead, the Lord at once sends His bona fide representative. The sincere devotee is thus assured by the Lord of going back to Godhead. The conclusion is that to get the assistance and help of a bona fide spiritual master means to receive the direct help of the Lord Himself."

Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it is the right type of disciple because he puts forward questions vital to the interest of all men, particularly for the dying men.

A pound of milk fresh from the milk bag of a cow is sufficient to feed an adult with all vitamin values, and therefore saints and sages live only on milk. Even the poorest of the householders keep at least ten cows, each delivering twelve to twenty quarts of milk, and therefore no one hesitates to spare a few pounds of milk for the mendicants. It is the duty of householders to maintain the saints and sages, like the children. So a saint like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b would hardly stay at the house of a householder for more than five minutes in the morning. In other words, such saints are very rarely seen in the houses of householders, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it therefore prayed to him to instruct him as soon as possible. The householders also should be intelligent enough to get some transcendental information from visiting sages. The householder should not foolishly ask a saint to deliver what is available in the market. That should be the reciprocal relation between the saints and the householders."
