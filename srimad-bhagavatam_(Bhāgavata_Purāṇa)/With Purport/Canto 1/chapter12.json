        "purport": " The king of Hastin\u0101pura (now Delhi) used to be the emperor of the world, at least till the time of the son of Emperor Par\u012bk\u1e63it. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was saved by the Lord in the womb of his mother, so he could certainly be saved from an untimely death due to the ill will of the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Because the Age of Kali began to act just after the assumption of power by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, the first sign of misgivings was exhibited in the cursing of such a greatly intelligent and devoted king as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. The king is the protector of the helpless citizens, and their welfare, peace and prosperity depend on him. Unfortunately, by the instigation of the fallen Age of Kali, an unfortunate br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s son was employed to condemn the innocent Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, and so the King had to prepare himself for death within seven days. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it is especially famous as one who is protected by Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and when he was unduly cursed by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s son, he could have invoked the mercy of the Lord to save him, but he did not want to because he was a pure devotee. A pure devotee never asks the Lord for any undue favor. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it knew that the curse of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s son upon him was unjustified, as everyone else knew, but he did not want to counteract it because he knew also that the Age of Kali had begun and that the first symptom of the age, namely degradation of the highly talented br\u0101hma\u1e47a community, had also begun. He did not want to interfere with the current of the time, but he prepared himself to meet death very cheerfully and very properly. Being fortunate, he got at least seven days to prepare himself to meet death, and so he properly utilized the time in the association of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the great saint and devotee of the Lord."

The effect of such a bona fide hearing and chanting of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was equally shared by both the hearer and the chanter. Both of them were benefited. Out of the nine different transcendental means of devotional service to the Lord prescribed in the Bh\u0101gavatam, either all of them, or some of them or even one of them are equally beneficial if properly discharged. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it and \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b were serious performers of the first two important items, namely the process of chanting and the process of hearing, and therefore both of them were successful in their laudable attempt. Transcendental realization is attained by such serious hearing and chanting and not otherwise. There is a type of spiritual master and disciple much advertised in this Age of Kali. It is said that the master injects spiritual force into the disciple by an electrical current generated by the master, and the disciple begins to feel the shock. He becomes unconscious, and the master weeps for his exhausting his store of so-called spiritual assets. Such bogus advertisement is going on in this age, and the poor common man is becoming the victim of such advertisement. We do not find such folk tales in the dealings of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and his great disciple Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. The sage recited \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam in devotion, and the great King heard him properly. The King did not feel any shock of electrical current from the master, nor did he become unconscious while receiving knowledge from the master. One should not, therefore, become a victim of these unauthorized advertisements made by some bogus representative of Vedic knowledge. The sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya were very respectful in hearing about Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it because of his receiving knowledge from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b by means of ardent hearing. Ardent hearing from the bona fide master is the only way to receive transcendental knowledge, and there is no need for medical performances or occult mysticism for miraculous effects. The process is simple, but only the sincere party can achieve the desired result."

He had no personal ambition and was freed from all sorts of sense gratification because of his continuous service unto the lotus feet of the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
        "purport": " As mentioned in our introduction, \u201cThere is a need for the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in human society for all the suffering humanity of the world, and we simply request the leading personalities of all nations to take to the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for their own good, for the good of society, and for the good of all the people of the world.\u201d So it is confirmed herein by the example of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, the personality of goodness. In India the people hanker after R\u0101ma-r\u0101jya because the Personality of Godhead was the ideal king and all other kings or emperors in India controlled the destiny of the world for the prosperity of every living being who took birth on the earth. Herein the word praj\u0101\u1e25 is significant. The etymological import of the word is \u201cthat which is born.\u201d On the earth there are many species of life, from the aquatics up to the perfect human beings, and all are known as praj\u0101s. Lord Brahm\u0101, the creator of this particular universe, is known as the praj\u0101pati because he is the grandfather of all who have taken birth. Thus praj\u0101 is used in a broader sense than it is now used. The king represents all living beings, the aquatics, plants, trees, reptiles, birds, animals and man. Every one of them is a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord (Bg. 14.4), and the king, being the representative of the Supreme Lord, is duty-bound to give proper protection to every one of them. This is not the case with the presidents and dictators of this demoralized system of administration, where the lower animals are given no protection while the higher animals are given so-called protection. But this is a great science which can be learned only by one who knows the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By knowing the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can become the most perfect man in the world, and unless one has knowledge in this science, all qualifications and doctorate diplomas acquired by academic education are spoiled and useless. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira knew this science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very well, for it is stated here that by continuous cultivation of this science, or by continuous devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he acquired the qualification of administering the state. The father is sometimes seemingly cruel to the son, but that does not mean that the father has lost the qualification to be a father. A father is always a father because he always has the good of the son at heart. The father wants every one of his sons to become a better man than himself. Therefore, a king like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, who was the personality of goodness, wanted everyone under his administration, especially human beings who have better developed consciousness, to become devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that everyone can become free from the trifles of material existence. His motto of administration was all good for the citizens, for as personified goodness he knew perfectly well what is actually good for them. He conducted the administration on that principle, and not on the r\u0101k\u1e63as\u012b, demonic, principle of sense gratification. As an ideal king, he had no personal ambition, and there was no place for sense gratification because all his senses at all times were engaged in the loving service of the Supreme Lord, which includes the partial service to the living beings, who form the parts and parcels of the complete whole. Those who are busy rendering service to the parts and parcels, leaving aside the whole, only spoil time and energy, as one does when watering the leaves of a tree without watering the root. If water is poured on the root, the leaves are enlivened perfectly and automatically, but if water is poured on the leaves only, the whole energy is spoiled. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, therefore, was constantly engaged in the service of the Lord, and thus the parts and parcels of the Lord, the living beings under his careful administration, were perfectly attended with all comforts in this life and all progress in the next. That is the way of perfect management of state administration."

        "purport": " Only a rich and great man\u2019s name and fame are known all over the world, and the name and fame of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira reached the higher planets because of his good administration, worldly possessions, glorious wife Draupad\u012b, the strength of his brothers Bh\u012bma and Arjuna, and his solid sovereign power over the world, known as Jambudv\u012bpa. Here the word lok\u0101\u1e25 is significant. There are different lokas or higher planets scattered all over the sky, both material and spiritual. A person can reach them by dint of his work in the present life, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25). No forceful entrance is allowed there. The tiny material scientists and engineers who have discovered vehicles to travel over a few thousand miles in outer space will not be allowed entrance. That is not the way to reach the better planets. One must qualify himself to enter into such happy planets by sacrifice and service. Those who are sinful in every step of life can expect only to be degraded into animal life to suffer more and more the pangs of material existence, and this is also stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.19). Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s good sacrifices and qualifications were so lofty and virtuous that even the residents of the higher celestial planets were already prepared to receive him as one of them."

        "translation": "O br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the opulence of the King was so enchanting that the denizens of heaven aspired for it. But because he was absorbed in the service of the Lord, nothing could satisfy him except the Lord\u2019s service.",
        "purport": " There are two things in the world which can satisfy living beings. When one is materially engrossed, he is satisfied only by sense gratification, but when one is liberated from the conditions of the material modes, he is satisfied only by rendering loving service for the satisfaction of the Lord. This means that the living being is constitutionally a servitor, and not one who is served. Being illusioned by the conditions of the external energy, one falsely thinks himself to be the served, but actually he is not served; he is servant of the senses like lust, desire, anger, avarice, pride, madness and intolerance. When one is in his proper senses by attainment of spiritual knowledge, he realizes that he is not the master of the material world, but is only a servant of the senses. At that time he begs for the service of the Lord and thus becomes happy without being illusioned by so-called material happiness. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was one of the liberated souls, and therefore for him there was no pleasure in a vast kingdom, good wife, obedient brothers, happy subjects and prosperous world. These blessings automatically follow for a pure devotee, even though the devotee does not aspire for them. The example set herein is exactly suitable. It is said that one who is hungry is never satisfied by anything other than food. The whole material world is full of hungry living beings. The hunger is not for good food, shelter or sense gratification. The hunger is for the spiritual atmosphere. Due to ignorance only they think that the world is dissatisfied because there is not sufficient food, shelter, defense and objects of sense gratification. This is called illusion. When the living being is hungry for spiritual satisfaction, he is misrepresented by material hunger. But the foolish leaders cannot see that even the people who are most sumptuously materially satisfied are still hungry. And what is their hunger and poverty? This hunger is actually for spiritual food, spiritual shelter, spiritual defense and spiritual sense gratification. These can be obtained in the association of the Supreme Spirit, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore one who has them cannot be attracted by the so-called food, shelter, defense and sense gratification of the material world, even if they are relished by the denizens of the heavenly planets. Therefore, in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.16) it is said by the Lord that even in the topmost planet of the universe, namely the Brahmaloka, where the duration of life is multiplied by millions of years by earth calculation, one cannot satisfy his hunger. Such hunger can be satisfied only when the living being is situated in immortality, which is attained in the spiritual sky, far, far above the Brahmaloka, in the association of Lord Mukunda, the Lord who awards His devotees the transcendental pleasure of liberation."

Thus the Lord is all-pervading by His inconceivable potency, and thus He entered the womb of Uttar\u0101 to save His beloved devotee Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.31) the Lord assured everyone that His devotees are never to be vanquished. No one can kill a devotee of the Lord because he is protected by the Lord, and no one can save a person whom the Lord desires to kill. The Lord is all-powerful, and therefore He can both save and kill as He likes. He became visible to His devotee Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it even in that awkward position (in the womb of his mother) in a shape just suitable for his vision. The Lord can become bigger than thousands of universes and can become smaller than an atom at the same time. Merciful as He is, He becomes just suitable to the vision of the limited living being. He is unlimited. He is not limited by any measurement of our calculation. He can become bigger than what we can think of, and He can become smaller than what we can conceive. But in all circumstances He is the same all-powerful Lord. There is no difference between the thumblike Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in the womb of Uttar\u0101 and the full-fledged N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-dh\u0101ma, the kingdom of Godhead. He accepts the form of arc\u0101-vigraha (worshipable Deity) just to accept service from His different incapable devotees. By the mercy of the arc\u0101-vigraha, the form of the Lord in material elements, the devotees who are in the material world can easily approach the Lord, although He is not conceivable by the material senses. The arc\u0101-vigraha is therefore an all-spiritual form of the Lord to be perceived by the material devotees; such an arc\u0101-vigraha of the Lord is never to be considered material. There is no difference between matter and spirit for the Lord, although there is a gulf of difference between the two in the case of the conditioned living being. For the Lord there is nothing but spiritual existence, and similarly there is nothing except spiritual existence for the pure devotee of the Lord in his intimate relation with the Lord."

The Lord is mentioned herein as the supreme living being unlimited by time and space. Every living being is limited by time and space. Even though a living being is qualitatively one with the Lord, quantitatively there is a great difference between the Supreme Soul and the common individual soul. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 both the living beings and the Supreme Being are said to be all-pervading (yena sarvam ida\u1e41 tatam), yet there is a difference between these two kinds of all-pervasiveness. A common living being or soul can be all-pervading within his own limited body, but the supreme living being is all-pervading in all space and all time. A common living being cannot extend its influence over another common living being by its all-pervasiveness, but the Supreme Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead, is unlimitedly able to exert His influence over all places and all times and over all living beings. And because He is all-pervasive, unlimited by time and space, He can appear even within the womb of the mother of child Par\u012bk\u1e63it. He is mentioned herein as the protector of the righteous. Anyone who is a surrendered soul unto the Supreme is righteous, and he is specifically protected by the Lord in all circumstances. The Lord is the indirect protector of the unrighteous also, for He rectifies their sins through His external potency. The Lord is mentioned herein as one who is dressed in the ten directions. This means dressed with garments on ten sides, up and down. He is present everywhere and can appear and disappear at His will from everywhere and anywhere. His disappearance from the sight of the child Par\u012bk\u1e63it does not mean that He appeared on the spot from any other place. He was present there, and even after His disappearance He was there, although invisible to the eyes of the child. This material covering of the effulgent firmament is also something like a womb of the mother nature, and we are all put into the womb by the Lord, the father of all living beings. He is present everywhere, even in this material womb of mother Durg\u0101, and those who are deserving can see the Lord."

        "purport": " Astronomical calculations of stellar influences upon a living being are not suppositions, but are factual, as confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Every living being is controlled by the laws of nature at every minute, just as a citizen is controlled by the influence of the state. The state laws are grossly observed, but the laws of material nature, being subtle to our gross understanding, cannot be experienced grossly. As stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9), every action of life produces another reaction, which is binding upon us, and only those who are acting on behalf of Yaj\u00f1a (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) are not bound by reactions. Our actions are judged by the higher authorities, the agents of the Lord, and thus we are awarded bodies according to our activities. The law of nature is so subtle that every part of our body is influenced by the respective stars, and a living being obtains his working body to fulfill his terms of imprisonment by the manipulation of such astronomical influence. A man\u2019s destiny is therefore ascertained by the birthtime constellation of stars, and a factual horoscope is made by a learned astrologer. It is a great science, and misuse of a science does not make it useless. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it or even the Personality of Godhead appear in certain constellations of good stars, and thus the influence is exerted upon the body thus born at an auspicious moment. The most auspicious constellation of stars takes place during the appearance of the Lord in this material world, and it is specifically called jayant\u012b, a word not to be abused for any other purposes. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was not only a great k\u1e63atriya emperor, but also a great devotee of the Lord. Thus he cannot take his birth at any inauspicious moment. As a proper place and time is selected to receive a respectable personage, so also to receive such a personality as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, who was especially cared for by the Supreme Lord, a suitable moment is chosen when all good stars assembled together to exert their influence upon the King. Thus he took his birth just to be known as the great hero of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. This suitable arrangement of astral influences is never a creation of man\u2019s will, but is the arrangement of the superior management of the agency of the Supreme Lord. Of course, the arrangement is made according to the good or bad deeds of the living being. Herein lies the importance of pious acts performed by the living being. Only by pious acts can one be allowed to get good wealth, good education and beautiful features. The sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras of the school of san\u0101tana-dharma (man\u2019s eternal engagement) are highly suitable for creating an atmosphere for taking advantage of good stellar influences, and therefore garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, or the first seedling purificatory process prescribed for the higher castes, is the beginning of all pious acts to receive a good pious and intelligent class of men in human society. There will be peace and prosperity in the world due to good and sane population only; there is hell and disturbance only because of the unwanted, insane populace addicted to sex indulgence."

        "purport": " There is a need for a good and intelligent class of br\u0101hma\u1e47as who are expert in performing the purificatory processes prescribed in the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. Unless such purificatory processes are performed, there is no possibility of good population, and in the Age of Kali the population all over the world is of \u015b\u016bdra quality or lower for want of this purificatory process. It is not possible, however, to revive the Vedic process of purification in this age, for want of proper facilities and good br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but there is the P\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika system also recommended for this age. The P\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika system acts on the \u015b\u016bdra class of men, supposedly the population of the Kali-yuga, and it is the prescribed purificatory process suitable to the age and time. Such a purificatory process is allowed only for spiritual upliftment and not for any other purpose. Spiritual upliftment is never conditioned by higher or lower parentage. After the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na purificatory process, there are certain other sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras like s\u012bm\u0101ntonnayana, sadha-bhak\u1e63a\u1e47am, etc., during the period of pregnancy, and when the child is born the first purificatory process is j\u0101ta-karma. This was performed duly by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira with the help of good and learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as like Dhaumya, the royal priest, and K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya, who was not only a priest but also a great general. Both these learned and perfect priests, assisted by other good br\u0101hma\u1e47as, were employed by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to perform the ceremony. Therefore all the sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras, purificatory processes, are not mere formalities or social functions only, but they are all for practical purposes and can be successfully performed by expert br\u0101hma\u1e47as like Dhaumya and K\u1e5bpa. Such br\u0101hma\u1e47as are not only rare, but also not available in this age, and therefore, for the purpose of spiritual upliftment in this fallen age, the Gosv\u0101m\u012bs prefer the purificatory processes under P\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika formulas to the Vedic rites. K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya is the son of the great \u1e5a\u1e63i Sardban and was born in the family of Gautama. The birth is said to be accidental. By chance, the great \u1e5a\u1e63i Sardban met Janapad\u012b, a famous society girl of heaven, and the \u1e5a\u1e63i Sardban discharged semen in two parts. By one part immediately a male child and by the other part a female child were born as twins. The male child was later on known as K\u1e5bpa, and the female child was known as K\u1e5bp\u012b. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aantanu, while engaged in chase in the jungle, picked up the children and brought them up to the brahminical status by the proper purificatory process. K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya later became a great general like Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, and his sister was married to Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya later on took part in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra and joined the party of Duryodhana. K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya helped kill Abhimanyu, the father of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, but he was still held in esteem by the family of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas due to his being as great a br\u0101hma\u1e47a as Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. When the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were sent to the forest after being defeated in the gambling game with Duryodhana, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra entrusted the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas to K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya for guidance. After the end of the battle, K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya again became a member of the royal assembly, and he was called during the birth of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it for recitation of auspicious Vedic hymns to make the ceremony successful. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, while quitting the palace for his great departure to the Him\u0101layas, entrusted K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it as his disciple, and he left home satisfied because of K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s taking charge of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. The great administrators, kings and emperors were always under the guidance of learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as like K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya and thus were able to act properly in the discharge of political responsibilities."

        "purport": " Only the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and sanny\u0101s\u012bs are authorized to accept charity from the householders. In all the different occasions of sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras, especially during the time of birth, marriage and death, wealth is distributed to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as because the br\u0101hma\u1e47as give the highest quality of service in regard to the prime necessity of humankind. The charity was substantial in the shape of gold, land, villages, horses, elephants and food grains, with other materials for cooking complete foodstuff. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as were not, therefore, poor in the actual sense of the term. On the contrary, because they possessed gold, land, villages, horses, elephants and sufficient grains, they had nothing to earn for themselves. They would simply devote themselves to the well-being of the entire society. The word t\u012brthavit is significant because the King knew well where and when charity has to be given. Charity is never unproductive or blind. In the \u015b\u0101stras charity was offered to persons who deserve to accept charity by dint of spiritual enlightenment. The so-called daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, a misconception of the Supreme Lord by unauthorized persons, is never to be found in the \u015b\u0101stras as the object of charity. Nor can a wretched poor man receive much munificent charity in the way of horses, elephants, land and villages. The conclusion is that the intelligent men, or the br\u0101hma\u1e47as specifically engaged in the service of the Lord, were properly maintained without anxiety for the needs of the body, and the King and other householders gladly looked after all their comforts. It is enjoined in the \u015b\u0101stras that as long as a child is joined with the mother by the navel pipe, the child is considered to be of one body with the mother, but as soon as the pipe is cut and the child is separated from the mother, the purificatory process of j\u0101ta-karma is performed. The administrative demigods and past forefathers of the family come to see a newly born child, and such an occasion is specifically accepted as the proper time for distributing wealth to the right persons productively for the spiritual advancement of society."

        "purport": " The child Par\u012bk\u1e63it was saved by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) for two reasons. The first reason is that the child in the womb of his mother was spotless due to his being a pure devotee of the Lord. The second reason is that the child was the only surviving male descendant of Puru, the pious forefather of the virtuous King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. The Lord wants to continue the line of pious kings to rule over the earth as His representatives for the actual progress of a peaceful and prosperous life. After the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, even up to the next generation of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was annihilated, and there were none who could generate another son in the great royal family. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, the son of Abhimanyu, was the only surviving heir apparent in the family, and by the irresistible supernatural brahm\u0101stra weapon of A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101, he was forced to be annihilated. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described herein as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and this is also significant. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the original Personality of Godhead, does the work of protection and annihilation in His capacity of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the plenary expansion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The all-pervasive activities of the Lord are executed by Him in His Vi\u1e63\u1e47u feature. Child Par\u012bk\u1e63it is described here as spotlessly white because he is an unalloyed devotee of the Lord. Such unalloyed devotees of the Lord appear on the earth just to execute the mission of the Lord. The Lord desires the conditioned souls hovering in the material creation to be reclaimed to go back home, back to Godhead, and thus He helps them by preparing the transcendental literatures like the Vedas, by sending missionaries of saints and sages and by deputing His representative, the spiritual master. Such transcendental literatures, missionaries and representatives of the Lord are spotlessly white because the contamination of the material qualities cannot even touch them. They are always protected by the Lord when they are threatened with annihilation. Such foolish threats are made by the gross materialists. The brahm\u0101stra, which was thrown by A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101 at the child Par\u012bk\u1e63it, was certainly supernaturally powerful, and nothing of the material world could resist its force of penetration. But the all-powerful Lord, who is present everywhere, within and without, could counteract it by His all-powerful potency just to save a bona fide servant of the Lord and descendant of another devotee, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, who was always obliged by the Lord by His causeless mercy."

        "purport": " The Lord gives protection to all living beings because He is their supreme leader. The Vedic hymns confirm that the Lord is the Supreme Person amongst all personalities. The difference between the two living beings is that the one, the Personality of Godhead, provides for all other living beings, and by knowing Him one can achieve eternal peace (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad). Such protection is given by His different potencies to different grades of living beings. But as far as His unalloyed devotees are concerned, He gives the protection personally. Therefore, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it is protected from the very beginning of his appearance in the womb of his mother. And because he is especially given protection by the Lord, the indication must be concluded that the child would be a first-grade devotee of the Lord with all good qualities. There are three grades of devotees, namely the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b and the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b. Those who go to the temples of the Lord and offer worshipful respect to the Deity without sufficient knowledge in the theological science and therefore without any respect for the devotees of the Lord are called materialistic devotees, or kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b, the third-grade devotees. Secondly, the devotees who have developed a mentality of genuine service to the Lord and who thus make friendships only with similar devotees, show favor to the neophytes and avoid the atheists are called the second-grade devotees. But those who see everything in the Lord or everything of the Lord and also see in everything an eternal relation of the Lord, so that there is nothing within their purview of sight except the Lord, are called the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavatas, or the first-grade devotees of the Lord. Such first-grade devotees of the Lord are perfect in all respects. A devotee who may be in any of these categories is automatically qualified by all good qualities, and thus a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata devotee like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it is certainly perfect in all respects. And because Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it took his birth in the family of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, he is addressed herein as the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, or the greatest of the fortunates. The family in which a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata takes his birth is fortunate because due to the birth of a first-grade devotee the members of the family, past, present and future up to one hundred generations, become liberated by the grace of the Lord, out of respect for His beloved devotee. Therefore, the highest benefit is done to one\u2019s family simply by becoming an unalloyed devotee of the Lord."

And therefore all the members of the state were happy, pious, well-behaved, prosperous and spiritually enlightened. Under strict guidance of the great souls and spiritual injunctions, such great saintly kings were trained up, and as a result the kingdom was full of saintly persons and was a happy land of spiritual life. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was himself a replica of his ancestors, and he desired that the next king after him become exactly like his great forefathers. He was happy to learn from the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as that by astrological calculations the child would be born a first-grade devotee of the Lord, and more confidentially he wanted to know whether the child was going to follow in the footsteps of his great forefathers. That is the way of the monarchical state. The reigning king should be a pious, chivalrous devotee of the Lord and fear personified for the upstarts. He must also leave an heir apparent equally qualified to rule over the innocent citizens. In the modern setup of the democratic states, the people themselves are fallen to the qualities of the \u015b\u016bdras or less, and the government is run by their representative, who is ignorant of the scriptural mode of administrative education. Thus the whole atmosphere is surcharged with \u015b\u016bdra qualities, manifested by lust and avarice. Such administrators quarrel every day among themselves. The cabinet of ministers changes often due to party and group selfishness. Everyone wants to exploit the state resources till he dies. No one retires from political life unless forced to do so. How can such low-grade men do good to the people? The result is corruption, intrigue and hypocrisy. They should learn from the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam how ideal the administrators must be before they can be given charge of different posts."

        "purport": " Praj\u0101 means the living being who has taken his birth in the material world. Actually the living being has no birth and no death, but because of his separation from the service of the Lord and due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is offered a suitable body to satisfy his material desires. In doing so, one becomes conditioned by the laws of material nature, and the material body is changed in terms of his own work. The living entity thus transmigrates from one body to another in 8,400,000 species of life. But due to his being the part and parcel of the Lord, he not only is maintained with all necessaries of life by the Lord, but also is protected by the Lord and His representatives, the saintly kings. These saintly kings give protection to all the praj\u0101s, or living beings, to live and to fulfill their terms of imprisonment. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was actually an ideal saintly king because while touring his kingdom he happened to see that a poor cow was about to be killed by the personified Kali, whom he at once took to task as a murderer. This means that even the animals were given protection by the saintly administrators, not from any sentimental point of view, but because those who have taken their birth in the material world have the right to live. All the saintly kings, beginning from the King of the sun globe down to the King of the earth, are so inclined by the influence of the Vedic literatures. The Vedic literatures are taught in higher planets also, as there is reference in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.1) about the teachings to the sun-god (Vivasv\u0101n) by the Lord, and such lessons are transferred by disciplic succession, as it was done by the sun-god to his son Manu, and from Manu to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku. There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahm\u0101, and the Manu referred to herein is the seventh Manu, who is one of the praj\u0101patis (those who create progeny), and he is the son of the sun-god. He is known as the Vaivasvata Manu. He had ten sons, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku is one of them. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku also learned bhakti-yoga as taught in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from his father, Manu, who got it from his father, the sun-god. Later on the teaching of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 came down by disciplic succession from Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, but in course of time the chain was broken by unscrupulous persons, and therefore it again had to be taught to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. So all the Vedic literatures are current from the very beginning of creation of the material world, and thus the Vedic literatures are known as apauru\u1e63eya (\u201cnot made by man\u201d). The Vedic knowledge was spoken by the Lord and first heard by Brahm\u0101, the first created living being within the universe. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku: One of the sons of Vaivasvata Manu. He had one hundred sons. He prohibited meat-eating. His son \u015aa\u015b\u0101da became the next king after his death. Manu: The Manu mentioned in this verse as the father of Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku is the seventh Manu, of the name Vaivasvata Manu, the son of sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, to whom Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructed the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 prior to His teaching them to Arjuna. Mankind is the descendant of Manu. This Vaivasvata Manu had ten sons, named Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, Nabhaga, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, \u015aary\u0101ti, Nari\u1e63yanta, N\u0101bh\u0101ga, Di\u1e63\u1e6da, Kar\u016b\u1e63a, P\u1e5b\u1e63adhra and Vasum\u0101n. The Lord\u2019s incarnation Matsya (the gigantic fish) was advented during the beginning of Vaivasvata Manu\u2019s reign. He learned the principles of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from his father, Vivasv\u0101n, the sun-god, and he reinstructed the same to his son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku. In the beginning of the Tret\u0101-yuga the sun-god instructed devotional service to Manu, and Manu in his turn instructed it to Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku for the welfare of the whole human society. Lord R\u0101ma: The Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnated Himself as \u015ar\u012b R\u0101ma, accepting the sonhood of His pure devotee Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Da\u015baratha, the King of Ayodhy\u0101. Lord R\u0101ma descended along with His plenary portions, and all of them appeared as His younger brothers. In the month of Caitra on the ninth day of the growing moon in the Tret\u0101-yuga, the Lord appeared, as usual, to establish the principles of religion and to annihilate the disturbing elements. When He was just a young boy, He helped the great sage Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra by killing Sub\u0101hu and striking M\u0101r\u012bc\u0101, the two demons who were disturbing the sages in their daily discharge of duties. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas are meant to cooperate for the welfare of the mass of people. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a sages endeavor to enlighten the people by perfect knowledge, and the k\u1e63atriyas are meant for their protection. Lord R\u0101macandra is the ideal king for maintaining and protecting the highest culture of humanity, known as brahma\u1e47ya-dharma. The Lord is specifically the protector of the cows and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and hence He enhances the prosperity of the world. He rewarded the administrative demigods by effective weapons to conquer the demons through the agency of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra. He was present in the bow sacrifice of King Janaka, and by breaking the invincible bow of \u015aiva, He married S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b, daughter of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Janaka. After His marriage He accepted exile in the forest for fourteen years by the order of His father, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Da\u015baratha. To help the administration of the demigods, He killed fourteen thousand demons, and by the intrigues of the demons, His wife, S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b, was kidnapped by R\u0101va\u1e47a. He made friendship with Sugr\u012bva, who was helped by the Lord to kill Vali, brother of Sugr\u012bva. By the help of Lord R\u0101ma, Sugr\u012bva became the king of the V\u0101naras (a race of gorillas). The Lord built a floating bridge of stones on the Indian Ocean and reached La\u1e45k\u0101, the kingdom of R\u0101va\u1e47a, who had kidnapped S\u012bt\u0101. Later on R\u0101va\u1e47a was killed by Him, and R\u0101va\u1e47a\u2019s brother Vibh\u012b\u1e63a\u1e47a was installed on the throne of La\u1e45k\u0101. Vibh\u012b\u1e63a\u1e47a was one of the brothers of R\u0101va\u1e47a, a demon, but Lord R\u0101ma made him immortal by His blessings. On the expiry of fourteen years, after settling the affairs at La\u1e45k\u0101, the Lord came back to His kingdom, Ayodhy\u0101, by flower plane. He instructed His brother \u015aatrughna to attack Lava\u1e47\u0101sura, who reigned at Mathur\u0101, and the demon was killed. He performed ten a\u015bvamedha sacrifices, and later on He disappeared while taking a bath in the \u015aarayu River. The great epic R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a is the history of Lord R\u0101ma\u2019s activities in the world, and the authoritative R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a was written by the great poet V\u0101lm\u012bki."

        "purport": " A king becomes famous by his acts of charity, performances of yaj\u00f1as, protection of the surrendered, etc. A k\u1e63atriya king is proud to give protection to the surrendered souls. This attitude of a king is called \u012b\u015bvara-bh\u0101va, or factual power to give protection in a righteous cause. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord instructs living beings to surrender unto Him, and He promises all protection. The Lord is all-powerful and true to His word, and therefore He never fails to give protection to His different devotees. The king, being the representative of the Lord, must possess this attitude of giving protection to the surrendered souls at all risk. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aibi, the King of U\u015b\u012bnara, was an intimate friend of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yay\u0101ti, who was able to reach the heavenly planets along with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aibi. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aibi was aware of the heavenly planet where he was to be transferred after his death, and the description of this heavenly planet is given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (\u0100di-parva 96.6-9). Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aibi was so charitably disposed that he wanted to give over his acquired position in the heavenly kingdom to Yay\u0101ti, but he did not accept it. Yay\u0101ti went to the heavenly planet along with great \u1e5b\u1e63is like A\u1e63\u1e6daka and others. On inquiry from the \u1e5b\u1e63is, Yay\u0101ti gave an account of \u015aibi\u2019s pious acts when all of them were on the path to heaven. He has become a member of the assembly of Yamar\u0101ja, who has become his worshipful deity. As confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the worshiper of the demigods goes to the planets of the demigods (y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n); so Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aibi has become an associate of the great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava authority Yamar\u0101ja on that particular planet. While he was on the earth he became very famous as a protector of surrendered souls and a donor of charities. The King of heaven once took the shape of a pigeon-hunter bird (eagle), and Agni, the fire-god, took the shape of a pigeon. The pigeon, while being chased by the eagle, took shelter on the lap of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aibi, and the hunter eagle wanted the pigeon back from the King. The King wanted to give it some other meat to eat and requested the bird not to kill the pigeon. The hunter bird refused to accept the King\u2019s offer, but it was settled later on that the eagle would accept flesh from the body of the King of the pigeon\u2019s equivalent weight. The King began to cut flesh from his body to weigh in the balance equivalent to the weight of the pigeon, but the mystic pigeon always remained heavier. The King then put himself on the balance to equate with the pigeon, and the demigods were pleased with him. The King of heaven and the fire-god disclosed their identity, and the King was blessed by them. Devar\u1e63i N\u0101rada also glorified Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aibi for his great achievements, specifically in charity and protection. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aibi sacrificed his own son for the satisfaction of human beings in his kingdom. And thus child Par\u012bk\u1e63it was to become a second \u015aibi in charity and protection. Dau\u1e63yanti Bharata: There are many Bharatas in history, of which Bharata the brother of Lord R\u0101ma, Bharata the son of King \u1e5a\u1e63abha, and Bharata the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Du\u1e63yanta are very famous. And all these Bharatas are historically known to the universe. This earth planet is known as Bh\u0101rata, or Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a, due to King Bharata the son of \u1e5a\u1e63abha, but according to some this land is known as Bh\u0101rata due to the reign of the son of Du\u1e63yanta. So far as we are convinced, this land\u2019s name Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a was established from the reign of Bharata the son of King \u1e5a\u1e63abha. Before him the land was known as Il\u0101v\u1e5bta-var\u1e63a, but just after the coronation of Bharata, the son of \u1e5a\u1e63abha, this land became famous as Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a. But despite all this, Bharata the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Du\u1e63yanta was not less important. He is the son of the famous beauty \u015aakuntal\u0101. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Du\u1e63yanta fell in love with \u015aakuntal\u0101 in the forest, and Bharata was conceived. After that, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja forgot his wife \u015aakuntal\u0101 by the curse of Ka\u1e47va Muni, and the child Bharata was brought up in the forest by his mother. Even in his childhood he was so powerful that he challenged the lions and elephants in the forest and would fight with them as little children play with cats and dogs. Because of the boy\u2019s becoming so strong, more than the so-called modern Tarzan, the \u1e5b\u1e63is in the forest called him Sarvadamana, or one who is able to control everyone. A full description of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata is given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, \u0100di-parva. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, or the Kurus, are sometimes addressed as Bh\u0101rata due to being born in the dynasty of the famous Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata, the son of King Du\u1e63yanta."

        "translation": "Amongst great bowmen, this child will be as good as Arjuna. He will be as irresistible as fire and as unsurpassable as the ocean.",
        "purport": " In history there are two Arjunas. One is K\u0101rtav\u012brya Arjuna, the King of Haihaya, and the other is the grandfather of the child. Both the Arjunas are famous for their bowmanship, and the child Par\u012bk\u1e63it is foretold to be equal to both of them, particularly in fighting. A short description of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava Arjuna is given below: P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava Arjuna: The great hero of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. He is the k\u1e63atriya son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. Queen Kunt\u012bdev\u012b could call for any one of the demigods, and thus she called Indra, and Arjuna was born by him. Arjuna is therefore a plenary part of the heavenly king Indra. He was born in the month of Ph\u0101lguna (February-March), and therefore he is also called Ph\u0101lguni. When he appeared as the son of Kunt\u012b, his future greatness was proclaimed by air messages, and all the important personalities from different parts of the universe, such as the demigods, the Gandharvas, the \u0100dityas (from the sun globe), the Rudras, the Vasus, the N\u0101gas, the different \u1e5b\u1e63is (sages) of importance, and the Apsar\u0101s (the society girls of heaven), all attended the ceremony. The Apsar\u0101s pleased everyone by their heavenly dances and songs. Vasudeva, the father of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the maternal uncle of Arjuna, sent his priest representative Ka\u015byapa to purify Arjuna by all the prescribed sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras, or reformatory processes. His sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra of being given a name was performed in the presence of the \u1e5b\u1e63is, residents of \u015aata\u015b\u1e5b\u1e45ga. He married four wives, Draupad\u012b, Subhadr\u0101, Citra\u1e45gad\u0101 and Ul\u016bp\u012b, from whom he got four sons of the names \u015arutak\u012brti, Abhimanyu, Babhruv\u0101hana and Ir\u0101v\u0101n respectively. During his student life he was entrusted to study under the great professor Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, along with other P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the Kurus. But he excelled everyone by his studious intensity, and Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya was especially attracted by his disciplinary affection. Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya accepted him as a first-grade scholar and loved heartily to bestow upon him all the blessings of military science. He was so ardent a student that he used to practice bowmanship even at night, and for all these reasons Professor Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya was determined to make him the topmost bowman of the world. He passed very brilliantly the examination in piercing the target, and Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya was very pleased. Royal families at Ma\u1e47ipura and Tripura are descendants of Arjuna\u2019s son Babhruv\u0101hana. Arjuna saved Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya from the attack of a crocodile, and the \u0100c\u0101rya, being pleased with him, rewarded him with a weapon of the name brahma\u015biras. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Drupada was inimical toward Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, and thus when he attacked the \u0100c\u0101rya, Arjuna got him arrested and brought him before Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. He besieged a city of the name Ahicchatra, belonging to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Drupada, and after taking it over he gave it to Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. The confidential treatment of the weapon brahma\u015biras was explained to Arjuna, and Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya was promised by Arjuna that he would use the weapon if necessary when he (Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya) personally became an enemy of Arjuna. By this, the \u0100c\u0101rya forecasted the future Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, in which Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya was on the opposite side. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Drupada, although defeated by Arjuna on behalf of his professor Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, decided to hand over his daughter Draupad\u012b to his young combatant, but he was disappointed when he heard the false news of Arjuna\u2019s death in the fire of a shellac house intrigued by Duryodhana. He therefore arranged for Draupad\u012b\u2019s personal selection of a groom who could pierce the eye of a fish hanging on the ceiling. This trick was especially made because only Arjuna could do it, and he was successful in his desire to hand over his equally worthy daughter to Arjuna. Arjuna\u2019s brothers were at that time living incognito under agreement with Duryodhana, and Arjuna and his brothers attended the meeting of Draupad\u012b\u2019s selection in the dress of br\u0101hma\u1e47as. When all the k\u1e63atriya kings assembled saw that a poor br\u0101hma\u1e47a had been garlanded by Draupad\u012b for her lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a disclosed his identity to Balar\u0101ma. He met Ul\u016bp\u012b at Haridv\u0101ra (Hardwar), and he was attracted by that girl belonging to N\u0101galoka, and thus Irav\u0101n was born. Similarly, he met Citr\u0101\u1e45gad\u0101, a daughter of the King of Ma\u1e47ipura, and thus Babhruv\u0101hana was born. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a made a plan to help Arjuna to kidnap Subhadr\u0101, sister of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because Baladeva was inclined to hand her over to Duryodhana. Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira also agreed with \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus Subhadr\u0101 was taken by force by Arjuna and then married to him. Subhadr\u0101\u2019s son is Abhimanyu, the father of Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the posthumous child. Arjuna satisfied the fire-god by setting fire to the Kh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava Forest, and thus the fire-god gave him one weapon. Indra was angry when the fire was set in the Kh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava Forest, and thus Indra, assisted by all other demigods, began fighting with Arjuna for his great challenge. They were defeated by Arjuna, and Indradeva returned to his heavenly kingdom. Arjuna also promised all protection to one May\u0101sura, and the latter presented him one valuable conchshell celebrated as the Devadatta. Similarly, he received many other valuable weapons from Indradeva when he was satisfied to see his chivalry. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was disappointed in defeating the King of Magadha, Jar\u0101sandha, it was Arjuna only who gave King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira all kinds of assurances, and thus Arjuna, Bh\u012bma and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a started for Magadha to kill Jar\u0101sandha. When he went out to bring all other kings of the world under the subjection of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, as was usual after the coronation of every emperor, he conquered the country named Kelinda and brought in subjugation King Bhagadatta. Then he traveled through countries like Antagiri, Ul\u016bkapura and Mod\u0101pura and brought under subjugation all the rulers. Sometimes he underwent severe types of penances, and later on he was rewarded by Indradeva. Lord \u015aiva also wanted to try the strength of Arjuna, and in the form of an aborigine, Lord \u015aiva met him. There was a great fight between the two, and at last Lord \u015aiva was satisfied with him and disclosed his identity. Arjuna prayed to the lord in all humbleness, and the lord, being pleased with him, presented him the p\u0101\u015bupata weapon. He acquired many other important weapons from different demigods. He received da\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101stra from Yamar\u0101ja, p\u0101\u015b\u0101stra from Varu\u1e47a, and antardh\u0101n\u0101stra from Kuvera, the treasurer of the heavenly kingdom. Indra wanted him to come to the heavenly kingdom, the Indraloka planet beyond the moon planet. In that planet he was cordially received by the local residents, and he was awarded reception in the heavenly parliament of Indradeva. Then he met Indradeva, who not only presented him with his vajra weapon, but also taught him the military and musical science as used in the heavenly planet. In one sense, Indra is the real father of Arjuna, and therefore indirectly he wanted to entertain Arjuna with the famous society girl of heaven, Urva\u015b\u012b, the celebrated beauty. The society girls of heaven are lusty, and Urva\u015b\u012b was very eager to contact Arjuna, the strongest human being. She met him in his room and expressed her desires, but Arjuna sustained his unimpeachable character by closing his eyes before Urva\u015b\u012b, addressing her as mother of the Kuru dynasty and placing her in the category of his mothers Kunt\u012b, M\u0101dr\u012b and \u015aac\u012bdev\u012b, wife of Indradeva. Disappointed, Urva\u015b\u012b cursed Arjuna and left. In the heavenly planet he also met the great celebrated ascetic Loma\u015ba and prayed to him for the protection of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. When his inimical cousin Duryodhana was under the clutches of the Gandharvas, he wanted to save him and requested the Gandharvas to release Duryodhana, but the Gandharvas refused, and thus he fought with them and got Duryodhana released. When all the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas lived incognito, he presented himself in the court of King Vir\u0101\u1e6da as a eunuch and was employed as the musical teacher of Uttar\u0101, his future daughter-in-law, and was known in the Vir\u0101\u1e6da court as the B\u1e5bhannala. As B\u1e5bhannala, he fought on behalf of Uttara, the son of King Vir\u0101\u1e6da, and thus defeated the Kurus in the fight incognito. His secret weapons were safely kept in the custody of a somi tree, and he ordered Uttara to get them back. His identity and his brothers\u2019 identity were later on disclosed to Uttara. Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya was informed of Arjuna\u2019s presence in the fight of the Kurus and the Vir\u0101\u1e6das. Later, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Arjuna killed many great generals like Kar\u1e47a and others. After the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, he punished A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101, who had killed all the five sons of Draupad\u012b. Then all the brothers went to Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. It is due to Arjuna only that the great philosophical discourses of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 were again spoken by the Lord on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. His wonderful acts on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra are vividly described in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Arjuna was defeated, however, by his son Babhruv\u0101hana at Ma\u1e47ipura and fell unconscious when Ul\u016bp\u012b saved him. After the disappearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the message was brought by Arjuna to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Again, Arjuna visited Dv\u0101rak\u0101, and all the widow wives of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a lamented before him. He took them all in the presence of Vasudeva and pacified all of them. Later on, when Vasudeva passed away, he performed his funeral ceremony in the absence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. While Arjuna was taking all the wives of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Indraprastha, he was attacked on the way, and he could not protect the ladies in his custody. At last, advised by Vy\u0101sadeva, all the brothers headed for Mah\u0101prasth\u0101na. On the way, at the request of his brother, he gave up all important weapons as useless, and he dropped them all in the water."

        "translation": "This child will be like his grandfather Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira or Brahm\u0101 in equanimity of mind. He will be munificent like the lord of the Kail\u0101sa Hill, \u015aiva. And he will be the resort of everyone, like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, who is even the shelter of the goddess of fortune.",
        "purport": " Mental equanimity refers both to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and to Brahm\u0101, the grandfather of all living beings. According to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the grandfather referred to is Brahm\u0101, but according to Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, the grandfather is Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira himself. But in both cases the comparison is equally good because both of them are recognized representatives of the Supreme Lord, and thus both of them have to maintain mental equanimity, being engaged in welfare work for the living being. Any responsible executive agent at the top of administration has to tolerate different types of onslaughts from the very persons for whom he works. Brahm\u0101j\u012b was criticized even by the gop\u012bs, the highest perfectional devotees of the Lord. The gop\u012bs were dissatisfied with the work of Brahm\u0101j\u012b because Lord Brahm\u0101, as creator of this particular universe, created eyelids which obstructed their seeing Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They could not tolerate a moment\u2019s blinking of the eyes, for it kept them from seeing their beloved Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So what to speak of others, who are naturally very critical of every action of a responsible man? Similarly, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira had to cross over many difficult situations created by his enemies, and he proved to be the most perfect maintainer of mental equanimity in all critical circumstances. Therefore the example of both grandfathers for maintaining equanimity of mind is quite fitting. Lord \u015aiva is a celebrated demigod who awards gifts to beggars. His name is therefore \u0100\u015buto\u1e63a, or one who is pleased very easily. He is also called the Bh\u016btan\u0101tha, or the lord of the common folk, who are mainly attached to him because of his munificent gifts, even without consideration of the aftereffects. R\u0101va\u1e47a was very attached to Lord \u015aiva, and by easily pleasing him, R\u0101va\u1e47a became so powerful that he wanted to challenge the authority of Lord R\u0101ma. Of course, R\u0101va\u1e47a was never helped by Lord \u015aiva when he fought with R\u0101ma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Lord of Lord \u015aiva. To V\u1e5bk\u0101sura, Lord \u015aiva awarded a benediction which was not only awkward, but also disturbing. V\u1e5bk\u0101sura became empowered, by the grace of Lord \u015aiva, to vanish anyone\u2019s head simply by touching it. Although this was awarded by Lord \u015aiva, the cunning fellow wanted to make an experiment of the power by touching the head of Lord \u015aiva. Thus the lord had to take shelter of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to save himself from trouble, and the Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, by His illusory potency, asked V\u1e5bk\u0101sura to make an experiment with his own head. The fellow did it and was finished himself, and so the world was saved from all sorts of trouble by such a cunning beggar of the demigods. The excellent point is that Lord \u015aiva never denies anyone any sort of gift. He is therefore the most generous, although sometimes some kind of a mistake is made. Ram\u0101 means the goddess of fortune. And her shelter is Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the maintainer of all living beings. There are innumerable living beings, not only on the surface of this planet but also in all other hundreds of thousands of planets. All of them are provided with all necessities of life for the progressive march towards the end of self-realization, but on the path of sense gratification they are put into difficulty by the agency of m\u0101y\u0101, the illusory energy, and so travel the path of a false plan of economic development. Such economic development is never successful because it is illusory. These men are always after the mercy of the illusory goddess of fortune, but they do not know that the goddess of fortune can live only under the protection of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Without Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the goddess of fortune is an illusion. We should therefore seek the protection of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u instead of directly seeking the protection of the goddess of fortune. Only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and the devotees of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can give protection to all, and because Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was himself protected by Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it was quite possible for him to give complete protection to all who wanted to live under his rule."

        "purport": " The last instruction of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is that one should give up everything and should follow in the footsteps of the Lord alone. Less intelligent persons do not agree to this great instruction of the Lord, as ill luck would have it, but one who is actually intelligent catches up this sublime instruction and is immensely benefited. Foolish people do not know that association is the cause of acquiring qualities. Association with fire makes an object hot, even in the material sense. Therefore, association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead makes one qualified like the Lord. As we have discussed previously, one can achieve seventy-eight percent of the godly qualities by the Lord\u2019s intimate association. To follow the instructions of the Lord is to associate with the Lord. The Lord is not a material object whose presence one has to feel for such association. The Lord is present everywhere and at all times. It is quite possible to have His association simply by following His instruction because the Lord and His instruction and the Lord and His name, fame, attributes and paraphernalia are all identical with Him, being absolute knowledge. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it associated with the Lord even from the womb of his mother up to the last day of his valuable life, and thus he acquired all the essential good qualities of the Lord in all perfection. Rantideva: An ancient king prior to the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata period, referred to by N\u0101rada Muni while instructing Sa\u00f1jaya, as mentioned in Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (Dro\u1e47a-parva 67). He was a great king, liberal for hospitality and distribution of foodstuff. Even Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a praised his acts of charity and hospitality. He was blessed by the great Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni for supplying him cold water, and thus he achieved the heavenly planet. He used to supply fruits, roots and leaves to the \u1e5b\u1e63is, and thus he was blessed by them with fulfillment of his desires. Although a k\u1e63atriya by birth, he never ate flesh in his life. He was especially hospitable to Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni, and by his blessings only he attained the higher planetary residence. He is one of those pious kings whose names are remembered in the morning and evening. Yay\u0101ti: The great emperor of the world and the original forefather of all great nations of the world who belong to the \u0100ryan and Indo-European stock. He is the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nahu\u1e63a, and he became the emperor of the world due to his elder brother\u2019s becoming a great and liberated saintly mystic. He ruled over the world for several thousands of years and performed many sacrifices and pious activities recorded in history, although his early youth was very lustful and full of romantic stories. He fell in love with Devay\u0101n\u012b, the most beloved daughter of \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya. Devay\u0101n\u012b wished to marry him, but at first he refused to accept her because of her being a daughter of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. According to \u015b\u0101stras, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a could marry the daughter of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. They were very much cautious about var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara population in the world. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya amended this law of forbidden marriage and induced Emperor Yay\u0101ti to accept Devay\u0101n\u012b. Devay\u0101n\u012b had a girlfriend named \u015aarmi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101, who also fell in love with the emperor and thus went with her friend Devay\u0101n\u012b. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya forbade Emperor Yay\u0101ti to call \u015aarmi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 into his bedroom, but Yay\u0101ti could not strictly follow his instruction. He secretly married \u015aarmi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 also and begot sons by her. When this was known by Devay\u0101n\u012b, she went to her father and lodged a complaint. Yay\u0101ti was much attached to Devay\u0101n\u012b, and when he went to his father-in-law\u2019s place to call her, \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya was angry with him and cursed him to become impotent. Yay\u0101ti begged his father-in-law to withdraw his curse, but the sage asked Yay\u0101ti to ask youthfulness from his sons and let them become old as the condition of his becoming potent. He had five sons, two from Devay\u0101n\u012b and three from \u015aarmi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101. From his five sons, namely (1) Yadu, (2) Turvasu, (3) Druhyu, (4) Anu and (5) P\u016bru, five famous dynasties, namely (1) the Yadu dynasty, (2) the Yavana (Turk) dynasty, (3) the Bhoja dynasty, (4) the Mleccha dynasty (Greek) and (5) the Paurava dynasty, all emanated to spread all over the world. He reached the heavenly planets by dint of his pious acts, but he fell down from there because of his self-advertisement and criticizing other great souls. After his fall, his daughter and grandson bestowed upon him their accumulated virtues, and by the help of his grandson and friend \u015aibi, he was again promoted to the heavenly kingdom, becoming one of the assembly members of Yamar\u0101ja, with whom he is staying as a devotee. He performed more than one thousand different sacrifices, gave in charity very liberally and was a very influential king. His majestic power was felt all over the world. His youngest son agreed to award him his youthfulness when he was troubled with lustful desires, even for one thousand years. Finally he became detached from worldly life and returned the youthfulness again to his son P\u016bru. He wanted to hand over the kingdom to P\u016bru, but his noblemen and the subjects did not agree. But when he explained to his subjects the greatness of P\u016bru, they agreed to accept P\u016bru as the King, and thus Emperor Yay\u0101ti retired from family life and left home for the forest."

Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is a great authority in devotional service because he sacrificed everything to please the Lord and relinquished the connection of his so-called spiritual master who obstructed him on the path of risking everything for the service of the Lord. The highest perfection of religious life is to attain to the stage of unqualified devotional service of the Lord without any cause or without being obstructed by any kind of worldly obligation. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was determined to give up everything for the satisfaction of the Lord, and he did not care for any obstruction whatsoever. He is the grandson of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, another authority in the devotional service of the Lord.

His father, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, chastised him severely when he was only five years old for his becoming an unalloyed devotee of the Lord. He was the first son of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, and his mother\u2019s name was Kay\u0101dhu. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was an authority in the devotional service of the Lord because he had his father killed by Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, setting the example that even a father should be removed from the path of devotional service if such a father happens to be an obstacle. He had four sons, and the eldest son, Virocana, is the father of Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, mentioned above. The history of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s activities is described in the Seventh Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

In the line of royal succession in the family of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, all the kings, without exception, were the wisest men of their times, and so also it is foretold about Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it and his son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Janamejaya, who was yet to be born. Such wise kings can become chastisers of upstarts and uprooters of Kali, or quarrelsome elements. As will be clear in the chapters ahead, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it wanted to kill the personified Kali, who was attempting to kill a cow, the emblem of peace and religion. The symptoms of Kali are (1) wine, (2) women, (3) gambling and (4) slaughterhouses. Wise rulers of all states should take lessons from Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it in how to maintain peace and morality by subduing the upstarts and quarrelsome people who indulge in wine, illicit connection with women, gambling and meat-eating supplied by regularly maintained slaughterhouses. In this Age of Kali, regular license is issued for maintaining all of these different departments of quarrel. So how can they expect peace and morality in the state? The state fathers, therefore, must follow the principles of becoming wiser by devotion to the Lord, by chastising the breaker of discipline and by uprooting the symptoms of quarrel, as mentioned above. If we want blazing fire, we must use dry fuel. Blazing fire and moist fuel go ill together. Peace and morality can prosper only by the principles of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it and his followers."

Philosophy means to seek after the right knowledge of one\u2019s own self, or the knowledge of self-realization. Without self-realization, philosophy is dry speculation or a waste of time and energy. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam gives the right knowledge of one\u2019s own self, and by hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam one can get free from material attachment and enter into the kingdom of fearlessness. This material world is fearfulness. Its prisoners are always fearful as within a prison house. In the prison house no one can violate the jail rules and regulations, and violating the rules means another term for extension of prison life. Similarly, we in this material existence are always fearful. This fearfulness is called anxiety. Everyone in the material life, in all species and varieties of life, is full of anxieties, either by breaking or without breaking the laws of nature. Liberation, or mukti, means getting relief from these constant anxieties. This is possible only when the anxiety is changed to the devotional service of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam gives us the chance to change the quality of anxiety from matter to spirit. This is done in the association of a learned philosopher like the self-realized \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the great son of \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva.

Such imitative hearing of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is a caricature only, and one should not be misled by such a performance of bh\u0101gavatam sapt\u0101ha undertaken by ridiculous greedy fellows to maintain an establishment of material enjoyment."

        "purport": " The Vedas are the storehouse of knowledge, both material and spiritual. But such knowledge aims at perfection of self-realization. In other words, the Vedas are the guides for the civilized man in every respect. Since human life is the opportunity to get free from all material miseries, it is properly guided by the knowledge of the Vedas, in the matters of both material needs and spiritual salvation. The specific intelligent class of men who were devoted particularly to the knowledge of the Vedas were called the vipras, or the graduates of the Vedic knowledge. There are different branches of knowledge in the Vedas, of which astrology and pathology are two important branches necessary for the common man. So the intelligent men, generally known as the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, took up all the different branches of Vedic knowledge to guide society. Even the department of military education (Dhanur-veda) was also taken up by such intelligent men, and the vipras were also teachers of this section of knowledge, as were Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, K\u1e5bp\u0101c\u0101rya, etc. The word vipra mentioned herein is significant. There is a little difference between the vipras and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The vipras are those who are expert in karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, or fruitive activities, guiding the society towards fulfilling the material necessities of life, whereas the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are expert in spiritual knowledge of transcendence. This department of knowledge is called j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, and above this there is the up\u0101san\u0101-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. The culmination of up\u0101san\u0101-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da is the devotional service of the Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and when the br\u0101hma\u1e47as achieve perfection, they are called Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u worship is the highest of the modes of worship. Elevated br\u0101hma\u1e47as are Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, and thus \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which is the science of devotional service, is very dear to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. And as explained in the beginning of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, it is the mature fruit of Vedic knowledge and is superior subject matter, above the three k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0das, namely karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and up\u0101san\u0101. Amongst the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da experts, the j\u0101taka expert vipras were good astrologers who could tell all the future history of a born child simply by the astral calculations of the time (lagna). Such expert j\u0101taka-vipras were present during the birth of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, and his grandfather, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, awarded the vipras sufficiently with gold, land, villages, grains and other valuable necessaries of life, which also include cows. There is a need of such vipras in the social structure, and it is the duty of the state to maintain them comfortably, as designed in the Vedic procedure. Such expert vipras, being sufficiently paid by the state, could give free service to the people in general, and thus this department of Vedic knowledge could be available for all."

        "translation": "So his son would become famous in the world as Par\u012bk\u1e63it [examiner] because he would come to examine all human beings in his search after that personality whom he saw before his birth. Thus he would come to constantly contemplate Him.",
        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, fortunate as he was, got the impression of the Lord even in the womb of his mother, and thus his contemplation on the Lord was constantly with him. Once the impression of the transcendental form of the Lord is fixed in one\u2019s mind, one can never forget Him in any circumstance. Child Par\u012bk\u1e63it, after coming out of the womb, was in the habit of examining everyone to see whether he was the same personality whom he first saw in the womb. But no one could be equal to or more attractive than the Lord, and therefore he never accepted anyone. But the Lord was constantly with him by such examination, and thus Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord by remembrance. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b remarks in this connection that every child, if given an impression of the Lord from his very childhood, certainly becomes a great devotee of the Lord like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. One may not be as fortunate as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it to have the opportunity to see the Lord in the womb of his mother, but even if he is not so fortunate, he can be made so if the parents of the child desire him to be so. There is a practical example in my personal life in this connection. My father was a pure devotee of the Lord, and when I was only four or five years old, my father gave me a couple of forms of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In a playful manner, I used to worship these Deities along with my sister, and I used to imitate the performances of a neighboring temple of R\u0101dh\u0101-Govinda. By constantly visiting this neighboring temple and copying the ceremonies in connection with my own Deities of play, I developed a natural affinity for the Lord. My father used to observe all the ceremonies befitting my position. Later on, these activities were suspended due to my association in the schools and colleges, and I became completely out of practice. But in my youthful days, when I met my spiritual master, \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bmad Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, again I revived my old habit, and the same playful Deities became my worshipful Deities in proper regulation. This was followed up until I left the family connection, and I am pleased that my generous father gave the first impression which was developed later into regulative devotional service by His Divine Grace. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Prahl\u0101da also advised that such impressions of a godly relation must be impregnated from the beginning of childhood; otherwise one may miss the opportunity of the human form of life, which is very valuable although it is temporary like others."

        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Marutta: one of the great emperors of the world. He reigned over the world long before the reign of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. He was the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Avik\u1e63it and was a great devotee of the son of the sun-god, known as Yamar\u0101ja. His brother Samvarta was a rival priest of the great B\u1e5bhaspati, the learned priest of the demigods. He conducted one sacrifice called Sa\u1e45kara-yaj\u00f1a by which the Lord was so satisfied that He was pleased to hand over to him the charge of a mountain peak of gold. This peak of gold is somewhere in the Him\u0101laya Mountains, and modern adventurers may try to find it there. He was so powerful an emperor that at the day\u2019s end of sacrifice, the demigods from the other planets like Indra, Candra and B\u1e5bhaspati used to visit his palace. And because he had the gold peak at his disposal, he had sufficient gold in his possession. The canopy of the sacrificial altar was completely made of gold. In his daily performances of the sacrificial ceremonies, some of the inhabitants of the V\u0101yuloka (airy planets) were invited to expedite the cooking work of the ceremony. And the assembly of the demigods in the ceremony was led by Vi\u015bvadeva. By his constant pious work he was able to drive out all kinds of diseases from the jurisdiction of his kingdom. All the inhabitants of higher planets like Devaloka and Pit\u1e5bloka were pleased with him for his great sacrificial ceremonies. Every day he used to give in charity to the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as such things as beddings, seats, conveyances and sufficient quantities of gold. Because of munificent charities and performances of innumerable sacrifices, the King of heaven, Indradeva, was fully satisfied with him and always wished for his welfare. Due to his pious activities, he remained a young man throughout his life and reigned over the world for one thousand years, surrounded by his satisfied subjects, ministers, legitimate wife, sons and brothers. Even Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a praised his spirit of pious activities. He handed over his only daughter to Mahar\u1e63i A\u1e45gir\u0101, and by his good blessings he was elevated to the kingdom of heaven. First of all, he wanted to offer the priesthood of his sacrifices to learned B\u1e5bhaspati, but the demigod refused to accept the post because of the King\u2019s being a human being, a man of this earth. He was very sorry for this, but on the advice of N\u0101rada Muni he appointed Samvarta to the post, and he was successful in his mission. The success of a particular type of sacrifice completely depends on the priest in charge. In this age, all kinds of sacrifice are forbidden because there is no learned priest amongst the so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who go by the false notion of becoming sons of br\u0101hma\u1e47as without brahminical qualifications. In this Age of Kali, therefore, only one kind of sacrifice is recommended, sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, as inaugurated by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu."

        "translation": "By those riches, the King could procure the ingredients for three horse sacrifices. Thus the pious King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, who was very fearful after the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, pleased Lord Hari, the Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was the ideal and celebrated pious King of the world, and still he was greatly afraid after the execution of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra because of the mass killing in the fight, all of which was done only to install him on the throne. He therefore took all the responsibility for sins committed in the warfare, and to get rid of all these sins, he wanted to perform three sacrifices in which horses are offered at the altar. Such a sacrifice is very costly. Even Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira had to collect the necessary heaps of gold left by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Marutta and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who were given gold in charity by King Marutta. The learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as could not take away all the loads of gold given by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Marutta, and therefore they left behind the major portion of the gift. And Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Marutta also did not again collect such heaps of gold given away in charity. Besides that, all the golden plates and utensils which were used in the sacrifice were also thrown in the dustbins, and all such heaps of gold remained unclaimed property for a long time, till Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira collected them for his own purposes. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advised the brothers of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to collect the unclaimed property because it belonged to the King. The more astonishing thing is that no subject of the state also collected such unclaimed gold for industrial enterprise or anything like that. This means that the state citizens were completely satisfied with all necessities of life and therefore not inclined to accept unnecessary productive enterprises for sense gratification. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira also requisitioned the heaps of gold for performing sacrifices and for pleasing the Supreme, Hari, the Personality of Godhead. Otherwise he had no desire to collect them for the state treasury. One should take lessons from the acts of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. He was afraid of sins committed on the battlefield, and therefore he wanted to satisfy the supreme authority. This indicates that unintentional sins are also committed in our daily occupational discharge of duties, and to counteract even such unintentional crimes, one must perform sacrifices as they are recommended in the revealed scriptures. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o \u2019nyatra loko \u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25) that one must perform sacrifices recommended in the scriptures in order to get rid of commitments of all unauthorized work, or even unintentional crimes which we are apt to commit. By doing so, one shall be freed from all kinds of sins. And those who do not do so but work for self-interest or sense gratification have to undergo all tribulations accrued from committed sins. Therefore, the main purpose of performing sacrifices is to satisfy the Supreme Personality Hari. The process of performing sacrifices may be different in terms of different times, places and persons, but the aim of such sacrifices is one and the same at all times and in all circumstances, viz., satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Hari. That is the way of pious life, and that is the way of peace and prosperity in the world at large. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira did all these as the ideal pious king in the world. If Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira is a sinner in his daily discharge of duties in royal administration of state affairs, wherein killing of man and animals is a recognized art, then we can just imagine the amount of sins committed consciously or unconsciously by the untrained population of the Kali-yuga who have no way to perform sacrifice to please the Supreme Lord. The Bh\u0101gavatam says, therefore, that the prime duty of the human being is to satisfy the Supreme Lord by the performance of one\u2019s occupational duty (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.13). Let any man of any place or community, caste or creed be engaged in any sort of occupational duty, but he must agree to perform sacrifices as it is recommended in the scriptures for the particular place, time and person. In the Vedic literatures it is recommended that in Kali-yuga people engage in glorifying the Lord by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (k\u012brtan\u0101d eva k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47asya mukta-sa\u1e45ga\u1e25 para\u1e41 vrajet) without offense. By doing so one can be freed from all sins and thus can attain the highest perfection of life by returning home, back to Godhead. We have already discussed this more than once in this great literature in different places, especially in the introductory portion by sketching the life of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, and still we are repeating the same with a view to bring about peace and prosperity in society. The Lord has declared openly in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 how He becomes pleased with us, and the same process is practically demonstrated in the life and preaching work of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. The perfect process of performing yaj\u00f1as, or sacrifice, to please the Supreme Lord Hari (the Personality of Godhead, who gets us free from all miseries of existence) is to follow the ways of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu in this dark age of quarrel and dissension. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira had to collect heaps of gold to secure the paraphernalia for the horse sacrifice yaj\u00f1as in days of sufficiency, so we can hardly think of such performance of yaj\u00f1as in these days of insufficiency and complete scarcity of gold. At the present moment we have heaps of papers and promises of their being converted into gold by economic development of modern civilization, and still there is no possibility of spending riches like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, either individually or collectively or by state patronization. Just suitable, therefore, for the age is the method recommended by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu in terms of the \u015b\u0101stra. Such a method requires no expenditure at all and yet can award more benefit than other expensive methods of yaj\u00f1a performances. The horse sacrifice yaj\u00f1a or cow sacrifice yaj\u00f1a performed by the Vedic regulations shouldn\u2019t be misunderstood as a process of killing animals. On the contrary, animals offered for the yaj\u00f1a were rejuvenated to a new span of life by the transcendental power of chanting the Vedic hymns, which, if properly chanted, are different from what is understood by the common layman. The Veda-mantras are all practical, and the proof is rejuvenation of the sacrificed animal. There is no possibility of such methodical chanting of the Vedic hymns by the so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47as or priests of the present age. The untrained descendants of the twice-born families are no more like their forefathers, and thus they are counted amongst the \u015b\u016bdras, or once-born men. The once-born man is unfit to chant the Vedic hymns, and therefore there is no practical utility of chanting the original hymns. And to save them all, Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu propounded the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement or yaj\u00f1a for all practical purposes, and the people of the present age are strongly recommended to follow this sure and recognized path."
