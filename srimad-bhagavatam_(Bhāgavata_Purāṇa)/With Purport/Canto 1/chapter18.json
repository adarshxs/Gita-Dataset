No one can know His actual position. He is unconquerable by knowledge also. We have heard about His dh\u0101ma, or place, eternal Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, but there are many scholars who interpret this abode in different ways. But by the grace of a spiritual master like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, unto whom the King gave himself up as a most humble disciple, one is able to understand the actual position of the Lord, His eternal abode, and His transcendental paraphernalia in that dh\u0101ma, or abode. Knowing the transcendental position of the Lord and the transcendental method by which one can approach that transcendental dh\u0101ma, the King was confident about his ultimate destination, and by knowing this he could leave aside everything material, even his own body, without any difficulty of attachment. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, it is stated, para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate: one can give up all connection with material attachment when one is able to see the param, or the superior quality of things. From Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we understand the quality of the Lord\u2019s energy that is superior to the material quality of energy, and by the grace of a bona fide spiritual master like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, it is quite possible to know everything of the superior energy of the Lord by which the Lord manifests His eternal name, quality, pastimes, paraphernalia and variegatedness. Unless one thoroughly understands this superior or eternal energy of the Lord, it is not possible to leave the material energy, however one may theoretically speculate on the true nature of the Absolute Truth. By the grace of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was able to receive the mercy of such a personality as \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, and thus he was able to know the actual position of the unconquerable Lord. It is very difficult to find the Lord from the Vedic literatures, but it is very easy to know Him by the mercy of a liberated devotee like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b."

This perfection of life is made possible by one who has learned the actual transcendental nature of the Lord from the Vedic hymns sung by a liberated soul like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b or someone in that line of disciplic succession. There is no gain in hearing the Vedic hymns from some mental speculator. When the same is heard from an actual self-realized soul and is properly understood by service and submission, everything becomes transparently clear. Thus a submissive disciple is able to live transcendentally and continue to the end of life. By scientific adaptation, one is able to remember the Lord even at the end of life, when the power of remembrance is slackened due to derangement of bodily membranes. For a common man, it is very difficult to remember things as they are at the time of death, but by the grace of the Lord and His bona fide devotees, the spiritual masters, one can get this opportunity without difficulty.

That is the technique of driving away the personality of Kali from the world. In modernized human society there are great advancements of material science, and they have invented the radio to distribute sound in the air. So instead of vibrating some nuisance sound for sense enjoyment, if the state arranges to distribute transcendental sound by resounding the holy name, fame and activities of the Lord, as they are authorized in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, then a favorable condition will be created, the principles of religion in the world will be reestablished, and thus the executive heads, who are so anxious to drive away corruption from the world, will be successful. Nothing is bad if properly used for the service of the Lord."

So he was never envious of the personality of Kali.",
        "purport": " The Age of Kali is called the fallen age. In this fallen age, because the living beings are in an awkward position, the Supreme Lord has given some special facilities to them. So by the will of the Lord, a living being does not become a victim of a sinful act until the act is actually performed. In other ages, simply by thinking of performing a sinful act, one used to become a victim of the act. On the contrary, a living being in this age is awarded with the results of pious acts simply by thinking of them. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, being the most learned and experienced king by the grace of the Lord, was not unnecessarily envious of the personality of Kali because he did not intend to give him any chance to perform any sinful act. He protected his subjects from falling prey to the sinful acts of the Age of Kali, and at the same time he gave full facility to the Age of Kali by allotting him some particular places. At the end of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said that even though all nefarious activities of the personality of Kali are present, there is a great advantage in the Age of Kali. One can attain salvation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Thus Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it made an organized effort to propagate the chanting of the Lord\u2019s holy name, and thus he saved the citizens from the clutches of Kali. It is for this advantage only that great sages sometimes wish all good for the Age of Kali. In the Vedas also it is said that by discourse on Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities, one can get rid of all the disadvantages of the Age of Kali. In the beginning of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is also said that by the recitation of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the Supreme Lord becomes at once arrested within one\u2019s heart. These are some of the great advantages of the Age of Kali, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it took all the advantages and did not think any ill of the Age of Kali, true to his Vai\u1e63\u1e47avite cult."

Our bodies have become black from the smoke, but we are factually pleased by the nectar of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, Govinda, which you are distributing.",
        "purport": " The sacrificial fire kindled by the sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya was certainly full of smoke and doubts because of so many flaws. The first flaw is that there is an acute scarcity of expert br\u0101hma\u1e47as able to carry out such performances successfully in this Age of Kali. Any discrepancy in such sacrifices spoils the whole show, and the result is uncertain, like agricultural enterprises. The good result of tilling the paddy field depends on providential rain, and therefore the result is uncertain. Similarly, performance of any kind of sacrifice in this Age of Kali is also uncertain. Unscrupulous greedy br\u0101hma\u1e47as of the Age of Kali induce the innocent public to such uncertain sacrificial shows without disclosing the scriptural injunction that in the Age of Kali there is no fruitful sacrificial performance but the sacrifice of the congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord. S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b was narrating the transcendental activities of the Lord before the congregation of sages, and they were factually perceiving the result of hearing these transcendental activities. One can feel this practically, as one can feel the result of eating food. Spiritual realization acts in that way. The sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya were practically sufferers from the smoke of a sacrificial fire and were doubtful about the result, but by hearing from a realized person like S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b, they were fully satisfied. In the Brahma-vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u tells \u015aiva that in the Age of Kali, men full of anxieties of various kinds can vainly labor in fruitive activity and philosophical speculations, but when they are engaged in devotional service, the result is sure and certain, and there is no loss of energy. In other words, nothing performed for spiritual realization or for material benefit can be successful without the devotional service to the Lord."

        "purport": " When there are some similar points, it is possible to compare one thing to another. One cannot compare the association of a pure devotee to anything material. Men who are addicted to material happiness aspire to reach the heavenly planets like the moon, Venus and Indraloka, and those who are advanced in material philosophical speculations aspire after liberation from all material bondage. When one becomes frustrated with all kinds of material advancement, one desires the opposite type of liberation, which is called apunar-bhava, or no rebirth. But the pure devotees of the Lord do not aspire after the happiness obtained in the heavenly kingdom, nor do they aspire after liberation from material bondage. In other words, for the pure devotees of the Lord the material pleasures obtainable in the heavenly planets are like phantasmagoria, and because they are already liberated from all material conceptions of pleasure and distress, they are factually liberated even in the material world. This means that the pure devotees of the Lord are engaged in a transcendental existence, namely in the loving service of the Lord, both in the material world and in the spiritual world. As a government servant is always the same, either in the office or at home or at any place, so a devotee has nothing to do with anything material, for he is exclusively engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. Since he has nothing to do with anything material, what pleasure can he derive from material benedictions like kingship or other overlordships, which are finished quickly with the end of the body? Devotional service is eternal; it has no end, because it is spiritual. Therefore, since the assets of a pure devotee are completely different from material assets, there is no comparison between the two. S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b was a pure devotee of the Lord, and therefore his association with the \u1e5b\u1e63is in Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya is unique. In the material world, association with gross materialists is veritably condemned. The materialist is called yo\u1e63it-sa\u1e45g\u012b, or one who is much attached to material entanglement (women and other paraphernalia). Such attachment is conditioned because it drives away the benedictions of life and prosperity. And just the opposite is bh\u0101gavata-sa\u1e45g\u012b, or one who is always in the association with the Lord\u2019s name, form, qualities, etc. Such association is always desirable; it is worshipable, it is praiseworthy, and one may accept it as the highest goal of life."

Can anyone who is expert in relishing nectar [rasa] ever be fully satiated by hearing topics about Him?",
        "purport": " Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 are two chiefs of the demigods. They are full of mystic powers. For example, Lord \u015aiva drank an ocean of poison of which one drop was sufficient to kill an ordinary living being. Similarly, Brahm\u0101 could create many powerful demigods, including Lord \u015aiva. So they are \u012b\u015bvaras, or lords of the universe. But they are not the supreme powerful. The supreme powerful is Govinda, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the Transcendence, and His transcendental attributes cannot be measured even by such powerful \u012b\u015bvaras as \u015aiva and Brahm\u0101. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the exclusive shelter of the greatest of all living beings. Brahm\u0101 is counted amongst the living beings, but he is the greatest of all of us. And why is the greatest of all the living beings so much attached to the transcendental topics of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? Because He is the reservoir of all enjoyment. Everyone wants to relish some kind of taste in everything, but one who is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord can derive unlimited pleasure from such engagement. The Lord is unlimited, and His name, attributes, pastimes, entourage, variegatedness, etc., are unlimited, and those who relish them can do so unlimitedly and still not feel satiated. This fact is confirmed in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cThe mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute Truth, and therefore the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is also known as R\u0101ma.\u201d There is no end to such transcendental discourses. In mundane affairs there is the law of satiation, but in transcendence there is no such satiation. S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b desired to continue the topics of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a before the sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya, and the sages also expressed their readiness to hear from him continuously. Since the Lord is transcendence and His attributes are transcendental, such discourses increase the receptive mood of the purified audience."

When such a combination is possible, namely a qualified speaker and a qualified audience, it is then and there very much congenial to continue discourses on the Transcendence. Professional speakers and a materially absorbed audience cannot derive real benefit from such discourses. Professional speakers make a show of Bh\u0101gavata-sapt\u0101ha for the sake of family maintenance, and the materially disposed audience hears such discourses of Bh\u0101gavata-sapt\u0101ha for some material benefit, namely religiosity, wealth, gratification of the senses, or liberation.

In such discourses, unlimited transcendental pleasure is relished both by the audience and by the speaker, and therefore they can continue the topics for many thousands of years. Now Bh\u0101gavata-sapt\u0101has are held for seven days only, and after finishing the show, both the audience and the speaker become engaged in material activities as usual. They can do so because the speaker is not bhagavat-pradh\u0101na and the audience is not \u015bu\u015br\u016b\u1e63at\u0101m, as explained above."

        "translation": "O S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b, please describe those topics of the Lord by which Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, whose intelligence was fixed on liberation, attained the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of Garu\u1e0da, the king of birds. Those topics were vibrated by the son of Vy\u0101sa [\u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva].",
        "purport": " There is some controversy amongst the students on the path of liberation. Such transcendental students are known as impersonalists and devotees of the Lord. The devotee of the Lord worships the transcendental form of the Lord, whereas the impersonalist meditates upon the glaring effulgence, or the bodily rays of the Lord, known as the brahmajyoti. Here in this verse it is said that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it attained the lotus feet of the Lord by instructions in knowledge delivered by the son of Vy\u0101sadeva, \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was also an impersonalist in the beginning, as he himself has admitted in the Bh\u0101gavatam (2.1.9), but later on he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and thus became a devotee. Such devotees with perfect knowledge are called mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavatas, or first-class devotees. There are three classes of devotees, namely the pr\u0101k\u1e5bta, madhyama and mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata. The pr\u0101k\u1e5bta, or third-class devotees, are temple worshipers without specific knowledge of the Lord and the Lord\u2019s devotees. The madhyama, or the second-class devotee, knows well the Lord, the Lord\u2019s devotees, the neophytes and the nondevotees also. But the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, or the first-class devotee, sees everything in relation with the Lord and the Lord present in everyone\u2019s relation. The mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, therefore, does not make any distinction, particularly between a devotee and nondevotee. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was such a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata devotee because he was initiated by a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata devotee, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. He was equally kind, even to the personality of Kali, and what to speak of others. So there are many instances in the transcendental histories of the world of an impersonalist who has later become a devotee. But a devotee has never become an impersonalist. This very fact proves that on the transcendental steps, the step occupied by a devotee is higher than the step occupied by an impersonalist. It is also stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (12.5) that persons stuck on the impersonal step undergo more sufferings than achievement of reality. Therefore knowledge imparted by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b unto Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it helped him attain the service of the Lord. And this stage of perfection is called apavarga, or the perfect stage of liberation. Simple knowledge of liberation is material knowledge. Actual freedom from material bondage is called liberation, but attainment of the transcendental service of the Lord is called the perfect stage of liberation. Such a stage is attained by knowledge and renunciation, as we have already explained (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.12), and perfect knowledge, as delivered by \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, results in the attainment of the transcendental service of the Lord."

Even by conversing with such great souls, one can without delay cleanse oneself of all disqualifications resulting from lower births.",
        "purport": " S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b did not take his birth in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. He was born in a family of mixed caste, or an uncultured low family. But because of higher association, like \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and the great \u1e5b\u1e63is of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya, certainly the disqualification of inferior birth was washed off. Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu followed this principle in pursuance of the Vedic usages, and by His transcendental association He elevated many lowborn, or those disqualified by birth or action, to the status of devotional service and established them in the position of \u0101c\u0101ryas, or authorities. He clearly stated that any man, whatever he may be, whether a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or \u015b\u016bdra by birth, or a householder or mendicant in the order of society, if he is conversant with the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can be accepted as an \u0101c\u0101rya or guru, a spiritual master. S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b learned the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from great \u1e5b\u1e63is and authorities like \u015aukadeva and Vy\u0101sadeva and he was so qualified that even the sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya eagerly wanted to hear from him the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the form of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. So he had the double association of great souls by hearing and preaching. Transcendental science, or the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has to be learned from the authorities, and when one preaches the science, he becomes still more qualified. So S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b had both the advantages, and thus undoubtedly he was completely freed from all disqualifications of low birth and mental agonies. This verse definitely proves that \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b did not refuse to teach S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b about the transcendental science nor did the sages of Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya refuse to hear lessons from him because of his inferior birth. This means that thousands of years ago there was no bar to learning or preaching the transcendental science because of inferior birth. The rigidity of the so-called caste system in Hindu society became prominent within only one hundred years or so when the number of dvija-bandhus, or disqualified men in the families of higher castes, increased. Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya revived the original Vedic system, and He elevated \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa to the position of n\u0101m\u0101c\u0101rya, or the authority in preaching the glories of the holy name of the Lord, although His Holiness \u015ar\u012bla Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura was pleased to appear in a family of Mohammedans. Such is the power of pure devotees of the Lord. The Ganges water is accepted as pure, and one can become purified after taking a bath in the waters of the Ganges. But as far as the great devotees of the Lord are concerned, they can purify a degraded soul even by being seen by the lowborn, and what to speak of association. Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu wanted to purify the whole atmosphere of the polluted world by sending qualified preachers all over the world, and it remains with the Indians to take up this task scientifically and thus do the best kind of humanitarian work. The mental diseases of the present generation are more acute than bodily diseases; it is quite fit and proper to take up the preaching of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam all over the world without delay. Mahattam\u0101n\u0101m abhidh\u0101na also means dictionary of great devotees, or a book full of the words of great devotees. Such a dictionary of the words of great devotees and those of the Lord are in the Vedas and allied literatures, specifically the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

        "purport": " The dvija-bandhu, or the less intelligent, uncultured men born of higher castes, put forward many arguments against the lower-caste men becoming br\u0101hma\u1e47as in this life. They argue that birth in a family of \u015b\u016bdras or less than \u015b\u016bdras is made possible by one\u2019s previous sinful acts and that one therefore has to complete the terms of disadvantages due to lower birth. And to answer these false logicians, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam asserts that one who chants the holy name of the Lord under the direction of a pure devotee can at once get free from the disadvantages due to a lower-caste birth. A pure devotee of the Lord does not commit any offense while chanting the holy name of the Lord. There are ten different offenses in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. To chant the holy name under the direction of a pure devotee is offenseless chanting. Offenseless chanting of the holy name of the Lord is transcendental, and therefore such chanting can at once purify one from the effects of all kinds of previous sins. This offenseless chanting indicates that one has fully understood the transcendental nature of the holy name and has thus surrendered unto the Lord. Transcendentally the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself are identical, being absolute. The holy name of the Lord is as powerful as the Lord. The Lord is the all-powerful Personality of Godhead, and He has innumerable names, which are all nondifferent from Him and are equally powerful also. In the last word of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord asserts that one who surrenders fully unto Him is protected from all sins by the grace of the Lord. Since His name and He Himself are identical, the holy name of the Lord can protect the devotee from all effects of sins. The chanting of the holy name of the Lord can undoubtedly deliver one from the disadvantages of a lower-caste birth. The Lord\u2019s unlimited power is extended on and on by the unlimited expansion of the devotees and incarnations, and thus every devotee of the Lord and incarnations also can be equally surcharged with the potency of the Lord. Since the devotee is surcharged with the potency of the Lord, even fractionally, the disqualification due to lower birth cannot stand in the way."

These are some of the instances of His complete independence and perfection. That He has nothing to do does not mean that He is impersonal. He is transcendentally so full of inconceivable potencies that simply by His willing, everything is done without physical or personal endeavor. He is called, therefore, Yoge\u015bvara, or the Lord of all mystic powers."

The Lord is one without a second, but He expands Himself in many ways, and this is confirmed in the Vedas. Such expansions of the Lord are limitless, but some of them are the living entities. The living entities are not as powerful as the Lord\u2019s plenary expansions, and therefore there are two different types of expansions. Lord Brahm\u0101 is generally one of the living entities, and Lord \u015aiva is the medium between the Lord and the living entities. In other words, even demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, who are the chief amongst all demigods, are never equal to or greater than Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, and all-powerful demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are engaged in the worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore who can be more powerful than Mukunda (Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) to be factually called the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b, Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva are not independently powerful; they are powerful as expansions of the Supreme Lord, and all of them are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, and so also are the living entities. There are four sects of worshipful devotees of the Lord, and the chief amongst them are the Brahma samprad\u0101ya, Rudra samprad\u0101ya and \u015ar\u012b samprad\u0101ya, descending directly from Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, respectively. Besides the above-mentioned three samprad\u0101yas, there is the Kum\u0101ra samprad\u0101ya, descending from Sanat-kum\u0101ra. All of the four original samprad\u0101yas are still scrupulously engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord up to date, and they all declare that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Mukunda, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no other personality is equal to Him or greater than Him."

        "purport": " Only the self-controlled can gradually be attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Self-controlled means not indulging in sense enjoyment more than is necessary. And those who are not self-controlled are given over to sense enjoyment. Dry philosophical speculation is a subtle sense enjoyment of the mind. Sense enjoyment leads one to the path of darkness. Those who are self-controlled can make progress on the path of liberation from the conditional life of material existence. The Vedas, therefore, enjoin that one should not go on the path of darkness but should make a progressive march towards the path of light or liberation. Self-control is actually achieved not by artificially stopping the senses from material enjoyment, but by becoming factually attached to the Supreme Lord by engaging one\u2019s unalloyed senses in the transcendental service of the Lord. The senses cannot be forcibly curbed, but they can be given proper engagement. Purified senses, therefore, are always engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This perfectional stage of sense engagement is called bhakti-yoga. So those who are attached to the means of bhakti-yoga are factually self-controlled and can all of a sudden give up their homely or bodily attachment for the service of the Lord. This is called the paramaha\u1e41sa stage. Ha\u1e41sas, or swans, accept only milk out of a mixture of milk and water. Similarly, those who accept the service of the Lord instead of m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s service are called the paramaha\u1e41sas. They are naturally qualified with all the good attributes, such as pridelessness, freedom from vanity, nonviolence, tolerance, simplicity, respectability, worship, devotion and sincerity. All these godly qualities exist in the devotee of the Lord spontaneously. Such paramaha\u1e41sas, who are completely given up to the service of the Lord, are very rare. They are very rare even amongst the liberated souls. Real nonviolence means freedom from envy. In this world everyone is envious of his fellow being. But a perfect paramaha\u1e41sa, being completely given up to the service of the Lord, is perfectly nonenvious. He loves every living being in relation with the Supreme Lord. Real renunciation means perfect dependence on God. Every living being is dependent on someone else because he is so made. Actually everyone is dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, but when one forgets his relation with the Lord, he becomes dependent on the conditions of material nature. Renunciation means renouncing one\u2019s dependence on the conditions of material nature and thus becoming completely dependent on the mercy of the Lord. Real independence means complete faith in the mercy of the Lord without dependence on the conditions of matter. This paramaha\u1e41sa stage is the highest perfectional stage in bhakti-yoga, the process of devotional service to the Supreme Lord."

        "purport": " The Supreme Lord is so kind to His pure devotees that in proper time He calls such devotees up to Him and thus creates an auspicious circumstance for the devotee. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was a pure devotee of the Lord, and there was no reason for him to become extremely fatigued, hungry and thirsty because a devotee of the Lord never becomes perturbed by such bodily demands. But by the desire of the Lord, even such a devotee can become apparently fatigued and thirsty just to create a situation favorable for his renunciation of worldly activities. One has to give up all attachment for worldly relations before one is able to go back to Godhead, and thus when a devotee is too much absorbed in worldly affairs, the Lord creates a situation to cause indifference. The Supreme Lord never forgets His pure devotee, even though he may be engaged in so-called worldly affairs. Sometimes He creates an awkward situation, and the devotee becomes obliged to renounce all worldly affairs. The devotee can understand by the signal of the Lord, but others take it to be unfavorable and frustrating. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was to become the medium for the revelation of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam by Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as his grandfather Arjuna was the medium for the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Had Arjuna not been taken up with an illusion of family affection by the will of the Lord, the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 would not have been spoken by the Lord Himself for the good of all concerned. Similarly, had Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it not been fatigued, hungry and thirsty at this time, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam would not have been spoken by \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the prime authority of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. So this is a prelude to the circumstances under which \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was spoken for the benefit of all concerned. The prelude, therefore, begins with the words \u201conce upon a time.\u201d"

The transcendental position is attained by three processes, namely the process of j\u00f1\u0101na, or theoretical knowledge of transcendence, the process of yoga, or factual realization of trance by manipulation of the physiological and psychological functions of the body, and the most approved process of bhakti-yoga, or the engagement of senses in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also we have the information of the gradual development of perception from matter to a living entity. Our material mind and body develop from the living entity, the soul, and being influenced by the three qualities of matter, we forget our real identity. The j\u00f1\u0101na process theoretically speculates about the reality of the soul. But bhakti-yoga factually engages the spirit soul in activities. The perception of matter is transcended to still subtler states of the senses. The senses are transcended to the subtler mind, and then to breathing activities and gradually to intelligence. Beyond the intelligence, the living soul is realized by the mechanical activities of the yoga system, or practice of meditation restraining the senses, regulating the breathing system and applying intelligence to rise to the transcendental position. This trance stops all material activities of the body. The King saw the muni in that position. He also saw the muni as follows."

        "translation": "The King, not received by any formal welcome by means of being offered a seat, place, water and sweet addresses, considered himself neglected, and so thinking he became angry.",
        "purport": " The law of reception in the codes of the Vedic principles states that even if an enemy is received at home, he must be received with all respects. He should not be given a chance to understand that he has come into the house of an enemy. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, accompanied by Arjuna and Bh\u012bma, approached Jar\u0101sandha in Magadha, the respectable enemies were given a royal reception by King Jar\u0101sandha. The guest enemy, namely Bh\u012bma, was to fight with Jar\u0101sandha, and yet they were given a grand reception. At night they used to sit down together as friends and guests, and in the day they used to fight, risking life and death. That was the law of reception. The reception law enjoins that a poor man, who has nothing to offer his guest, should be good enough to offer a straw mat for sitting, a glass of water for drinking and some sweet words. Therefore, to receive a guest, either friend or foe, there is no expense. It is only a question of good manners. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it entered the door of \u015aam\u012bka \u1e5a\u1e63i, he did not expect a royal reception by the \u1e5b\u1e63i because he knew that saints and \u1e5b\u1e63is are not materially rich men. But he never expected that a seat of straw, a glass of water and some sweet words would be denied to him. He was not an ordinary guest, nor was he an enemy of the \u1e5b\u1e63i, and therefore the cold reception by the \u1e5b\u1e63i astonished the King greatly. As a matter of fact, the King was right to get angry with the \u1e5b\u1e63i when he needed a glass of water very badly. To become angry in such a grave situation was not unnatural for the King, but because the King himself was not less than a great saint, his becoming angry and taking action were astonishing. So it must be accepted that it was so ordained by the supreme will of the Lord. The King was a great devotee of the Lord, and the saint was also as good as the King. But by the will of the Lord, the circumstances were so created that they became ways to the King\u2019s becoming unattached to family connection and governmental activities and thus becoming a completely surrendered soul unto the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The merciful Lord sometimes creates such awkward positions for his pure devotees in order to drag them towards Himself from the mire of material existence. But outwardly the situations appear to be frustrating to the devotees. The devotees of the Lord are always under the protection of the Lord, and in any condition, frustration or success, the Lord is the supreme guide for the devotees. The pure devotees, therefore, accept all conditions of frustration as blessings from the Lord."

        "purport": " The King, being a devotee of the Lord, did not approve of his own action, and thus he began to wonder whether the sage was really in a trance or was just pretending in order to avoid receiving the King, who was a k\u1e63atriya and therefore lower in rank. Repentance comes in the mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura and \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b do not believe that the King\u2019s action was due to his past misdeeds. The arrangement was so made by the Lord just to call the King back home, back to Godhead. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, the plan was made by the will of the Lord, and by the will of the Lord the situation of frustration was created. The plan was that for his so-called misdeed the King could be cursed by an inexperienced br\u0101hma\u1e47a boy infected by the influence of Kali, and thus the King would leave his hearth and home for good. His connections with \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b would enable the presentation of the great \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which is considered to be the book incarnation of the Lord. This book incarnation of the Lord gives much fascinating information of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, like His r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101 with the spiritual cowherd damsels of Vrajabh\u016bmi. This specific pastime of the Lord has a special significance because anyone who properly learns about this particular pastime of the Lord will certainly be dissuaded from mundane sex desire and be placed on the path of sublime devotional service to the Lord. The pure devotee\u2019s mundane frustration is meant to elevate the devotee to a higher transcendental position. By placing Arjuna and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas in frustration due to the intrigue of their cousin-brothers, the prelude of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was created by the Lord. This was to incarnate the sound representative of the Lord, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. So by placing King Par\u012bk\u1e63it in an awkward position, the incarnation of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was created by the will of the Lord. Being distressed by hunger and thirst was only a show, because the King endured much, even in the womb of his mother. He was never disturbed by the glaring heat of the brahm\u0101stra released by A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101. The King\u2019s distressed condition was certainly unprecedented. The devotees like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it are powerful enough to forbear such distresses, by the will of the Lord, and they are never disturbed. The situation, in this case, was therefore all planned by the Lord."

        "purport": " The br\u0101hma\u1e47as are considered to be the head and brains of the social body, and the k\u1e63atriyas are considered to be the arms of the social body. The arms are required to protect the body from all harm, but the arms must act according to the directions of the head and brain. That is a natural arrangement made by the supreme order, for it is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that four social orders or castes, namely the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the k\u1e63atriyas, the vai\u015byas and the \u015b\u016bdras, are set up according to quality and work done by them. Naturally the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a has a good chance to become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by the direction of his qualified father, as a son of a medical practitioner has a very good chance to become a qualified medical practitioner. So the caste system is quite scientific. The son must take advantage of the father\u2019s qualification and thus become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or medical practitioner, and not otherwise. Without being qualified, one cannot become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or medical practitioner, and that is the verdict of all scriptures and social orders. Herein \u015a\u1e5b\u1e45gi, a qualified son of a great br\u0101hma\u1e47a, attained the required brahminical power both by birth and by training, but he was lacking in culture because he was an inexperienced boy. By the influence of Kali, the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a became puffed up with brahminical power and thus wrongly compared Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it to crows and watchdogs. The King is certainly the watchdog of the state in the sense that he keeps vigilant eyes over the border of the state for its protection and defense, but to address him as a watchdog is the sign of a less-cultured boy. Thus the downfall of the brahminical powers began as they gave importance to birthright without culture. The downfall of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a caste began in the Age of Kali. And since br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the heads of the social order, all other orders of society also began to deteriorate. This beginning of brahminical deterioration was highly deplored by the father of \u015a\u1e5b\u1e45gi, as we will find."

Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it gave license to Kali to live in four places as mentioned hereinbefore, but by his very expert government the personality of Kali could hardly find the places allotted him. The personality of Kali-yuga, therefore, was seeking the opportunity to establish authority, and by the grace of the Lord he found a hole in the puffed-up, inexperienced son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The little br\u0101hma\u1e47a wanted to show his prowess in destruction, and he had the audacity to punish such a great king as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. He wanted to take the place of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a after His departure. These are the principal signs of upstarts who want to take the place of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a under the influence of the Age of Kali. An upstart with a little power wants to become an incarnation of the Lord. There are many false incarnations after the departure of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the face of the globe, and they are misleading the innocent public by accepting the spiritual obedience of the general mass of people to maintain false prestige. In other words, the personality of Kali got the opportunity to reign through this son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, \u015a\u1e5b\u1e45gi."

The \u1e5b\u1e63i did not congratulate his son, but, on the contrary, began to repent, saying: Alas! What a great sinful act was performed by my son. He has awarded heavy punishment for an insignificant offense.",
        "purport": " The king is the best of all human beings. He is the representative of God, and he is never to be condemned for any of his actions. In other words, the king can do no wrong. The king may order hanging of a culprit son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, but he does not become sinful for killing a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Even if there is something wrong with the king, he is never to be condemned. A medical practitioner may kill a patient by mistaken treatment, but such a killer is never condemned to death. So what to speak of a good and pious king like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it? In the Vedic way of life, the king is trained to become a r\u0101jar\u1e63i, or a great saint, although he is ruling as king. It is the king only by whose good government the citizens can live peacefully and without any fear. The r\u0101jar\u1e63is would manage their kingdoms so nicely and piously that their subjects would respect them as if they were the Lord. That is the instruction of the Vedas. The king is called narendra, or the best amongst the human beings. How then could a king like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it be condemned by an inexperienced, puffed-up son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, even though he had attained the powers of a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a? Since \u015aam\u012bka \u1e5a\u1e63i was an experienced, good br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he did not approve of the actions of his condemned son. He began to lament for all that his son had done. The king was beyond the jurisdiction of curses as a general rule, and what to speak of a good king like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. The offense of the King was most insignificant, and his being condemned to death was certainly a very great sin for \u015a\u1e5b\u1e45gi. Therefore \u1e5a\u1e63i \u015aam\u012bka regretted the whole incident."

The Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was planned by the Lord to establish the real representative of the Lord, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. An ideal king thoroughly trained by culture and devotional service with the martial spirit makes a perfect king. Such a personal monarchy is far better than the so-called democracy of no training and responsibility. The thieves and rogues of modern democracy seek election by misrepresentation of votes, and the successful rogues and thieves devour the mass of population. One trained monarch is far better than hundreds of useless ministerial rogues, and it is hinted herein that by abolition of a monarchical regime like that of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, the mass of people become open to many attacks of the Age of Kali. They are never happy in an overly advertised form of democracy. The result of such a kingless administration is described in the following verses."

The Vedic way of life is the progressive march of the civilization of the \u0100ryans. The \u0100ryans are progressive in Vedic civilization. The Vedic civilization\u2019s destination is to go back to Godhead, back home, where there is no birth, no death, no old age and no disease. The Vedas direct everyone not to remain in the darkness of the material world but to go towards the light of the spiritual kingdom far beyond the material sky. The qualitative caste system and the orders of life are scientifically planned by the Lord and His representatives, the great \u1e5b\u1e63is. The perfect way of life gives all sorts of instruction in things both material and spiritual. The Vedic way of life does not allow any man to be like the monkeys and dogs. A degraded civilization of sense gratification and economic development is the by-product of a godless or kingless government of the people, by the people, and for the people. The people should not, therefore, begrudge the poor administrations they themselves elect."

The specific qualification of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it is summarized herein. The King, even calculated as a king only, was most celebrated as a ruler who administered the religious principles of the royal order. In the \u015b\u0101stras the duties of all castes and orders of society are prescribed. All the qualities of a k\u1e63atriya mentioned in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.43) were present in the person of the Emperor. He was also a great devotee of the Lord and a self-realized soul. Cursing such a king, when he was tired and fatigued with hunger and thirst, was not at all proper. \u015aam\u012bka \u1e5a\u1e63i thus admitted from all sides that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was cursed most unjustly. Although all the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were aloof from the incident, still for the childish action of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a boy the whole world situation was changed. Thus \u1e5a\u1e63i \u015aam\u012bka, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, took responsibility for all deterioration of the good orders of the world."

        "translation": "Then the \u1e5b\u1e63i prayed to the all-pervading Personality of Godhead to pardon his immature boy, who had no intelligence and who committed the great sin of cursing a person who was completely free from all sins, who was subordinate and who deserved to be protected.",
        "purport": " Everyone is responsible for his own action, either pious or sinful. \u1e5a\u1e63i \u015aam\u012bka could foresee that his son had committed a great sin by cursing Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, who deserved to be protected by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, for he was a pious ruler and completely free from all sins because of his being a first-class devotee of the Lord. When an offense is done unto the devotee of the Lord, it is very difficult to overcome the reaction. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, being at the head of the social orders, are meant to give protection to their subordinates and not to curse them. There are occasions when a br\u0101hma\u1e47a may furiously curse a subordinate k\u1e63atriya or vai\u015bya, etc., but in the case of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it there were no grounds, as already explained. The foolish boy had done it out of sheer vanity in being a br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s son, and thus he became liable to be punished by the law of God. The Lord never forgives a person who condemns His pure devotee. Therefore, by cursing a king the foolish \u015a\u1e5b\u1e45gi had committed not only a sin but also the greatest offense. Therefore the \u1e5b\u1e63i could foresee that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead could save his boy from his sinful act. He therefore directly prayed for pardon from the Supreme Lord, who alone can undo a thing which is impossible to change. The appeal was made in the name of a foolish boy who had developed no intelligence at all. A question may be raised herein that since it was the desire of the Lord that Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja be put into that awkward position so that he might be delivered from material existence, then why was a br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s son made responsible for this offensive act? The answer is that the offensive act was performed by a child only so that he could be excused very easily, and thus the prayer of the father was accepted. But if the question is raised why the br\u0101hma\u1e47a community as a whole was made responsible for allowing Kali into the world affairs, the answer is given in the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a that the demons who acted inimically toward the Personality of Godhead but were not killed by the Lord were allowed to take birth in the families of br\u0101hma\u1e47as to take advantage of the Age of Kali. The all-merciful Lord gave them a chance to have their births in the families of pious br\u0101hma\u1e47as so that they could progress toward salvation. But the demons, instead of utilizing the good opportunity, misused the brahminical culture due to being puffed up by vanity in becoming br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The typical example is the son of \u015aam\u012bka \u1e5a\u1e63i, and all the foolish sons of br\u0101hma\u1e47as are warned hereby not to become as foolish as \u015a\u1e5b\u1e45gi and to be always on guard against the demoniac qualities which they had in their previous births. The foolish boy was, of course, excused by the Lord, but others, who may not have a father like \u015aam\u012bka \u1e5a\u1e63i, will be put into great difficulty if they misuse the advantages obtained by birth in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family."

But he knew also that a pure devotee is callous about worldly advantages or reverses. As such, the devotees are never inclined to counteract personal defamation, curses, negligence, etc. As far as such things are concerned, in personal affairs the devotees do not care for them. But in the case of their being performed against the Lord and His devotees, then the devotees take very strong action. It was a personal affair, and therefore \u015aam\u012bka \u1e5a\u1e63i knew that the King would not take counteraction.

        "translation": "Generally the transcendentalists, even though engaged by others in the dualities of the material world, are not distressed. Nor do they take pleasure [in worldly things], for they are transcendentally engaged.",
        "purport": " The transcendentalists are the empiric philosophers, the mystics and the devotees of the Lord. Empiric philosophers aim at the perfection of merging into the being of the Absolute, mystics aim at perceiving the all-pervading Supersoul, and the devotees of the Lord are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Personality of Godhead. Since Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n are different phases of the same Transcendence, all these transcendentalists are beyond the three modes of material nature. Material distresses and happinesses are products of the three modes, and therefore the causes of such material distress and happiness have nothing to do with the transcendentalists. The King was a devotee, and the \u1e5b\u1e63i was a mystic. Therefore both of them were unattached to the accidental incident created by the supreme will. The playful child was an instrument in fulfilling the Lord\u2019s will."
