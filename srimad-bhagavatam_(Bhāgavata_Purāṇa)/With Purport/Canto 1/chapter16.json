He ruled by those great qualities which were foretold by expert astrologers at the time of his birth.",
        "purport": " At the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it\u2019s birth, the expert astrologer-br\u0101hma\u1e47as foretold some of his qualities. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it developed all those qualities, being a great devotee of the Lord. The real qualification is to become a devotee of the Lord, and gradually all the good qualities worthy of possession develop. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, or a first-class devotee, who was not only well versed in the science of devotion but also able to convert others to become devotees by his transcendental instructions. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was, therefore, a devotee of the first order, and thus he used to consult great sages and learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who could advise him by the \u015b\u0101stras how to execute the state administration. Such great kings were more responsible than modern elected executive heads because they obliged the great authorities by following their instructions left in Vedic literatures. There was no need for impractical fools to enact daily a new legislative bill and to conveniently alter it again and again to serve some purpose. The rules and regulations were already set forth by great sages like Manu, Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya, Par\u0101\u015bara and other liberated sages, and the enactments were all suitable for all ages in all places. Therefore the rules and regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. Kings like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it had their council of advisers, and all the members of that council were either great sages or br\u0101hma\u1e47as of the first order. They did not accept any salary, nor had they any necessity for such salaries. The state would get the best advice without expenditure. They were themselves sama-dar\u015b\u012b, equal to everyone, both man and animal. They would not advise the king to give protection to man and instruct him to kill the poor animals. Such council members were not fools or representatives to compose a fool\u2019s paradise. They were all self-realized souls, and they knew perfectly well how all living beings in the state would be happy, both in this life and in the next. They were not concerned with the hedonistic philosophy of eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. They were philosophers in the real sense, and they knew well what is the mission of human life. Under all these obligations, the advisory council of the king would give correct directions, and the king or executive head, being himself a qualified devotee of the Lord, would scrutinizingly follow them for the welfare of the state. The state in the days of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira or Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was a welfare state in the real sense of the term because no one was unhappy in that state, be he man or animal. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was an ideal king for a welfare state of the world."

Ir\u0101vat\u012b, being the daughter of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Uttara, was the cousin-sister of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, but cousin-brothers and -sisters were allowed to get married if they did not belong to the same gotra, or family. In the Vedic system of marriage, the importance of the gotra, or family, was stressed. Arjuna also married Subhadr\u0101, although she was his maternal cousin-sister. Janamejaya: One of the r\u0101jar\u1e63i kings and the famous son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. His mother\u2019s name was Ir\u0101vat\u012b, or according to some, M\u0101dravat\u012b. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Janamejaya begot two sons of the names J\u00f1\u0101t\u0101n\u012bka and \u015aa\u1e45kukar\u1e47a. He celebrated several sacrifices in the Kuruk\u1e63etra pilgrimage site, and he had three younger brothers named \u015arutasena, Ugrasena and Bh\u012bmasena II. He invaded Tak\u1e63a\u015bil\u0101 (Ajanta), and he decided to avenge the unlawful curse upon his great father, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. He performed a great sacrifice called Sarpa-yaj\u00f1a, to kill the race of serpents, including the tak\u1e63aka, which had bitten his father to death. On request from many influential demigods and sages, he had to change his decision to kill the race of snakes, but despite stopping the sacrifice, he satisfied everyone concerned in the sacrifice by rewarding them properly. In the ceremony, Mah\u0101muni Vy\u0101sadeva also was present, and he personally narrated the history of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra before the King. Later on by the order of Vy\u0101sadeva, his disciple Vai\u015bamp\u0101yana narrated before the King the subject matter of Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. He was much affected by his great father\u2019s untimely death and was very anxious to see him again, and he expressed his desire before the great sage Vy\u0101sadeva. Vy\u0101sadeva also fulfilled his desire. His father was present before him, and he worshiped both his father and Vy\u0101sadeva with great respect and pomp. Being fully satisfied, he most munificently gave charity to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as present at the sacrifice."

These were executed with sufficient rewards for the attendants. And at these sacrifices, even the common man could see demigods.",
        "purport": " It appears from this verse that interplanetary travel by the denizens of higher planets is easy. In many statements in Bh\u0101gavatam, we have observed that the demigods from heaven used to visit this earth to attend sacrifices performed by influential kings and emperors. Herein also we find that during the time of the horse sacrifice ceremony of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, the demigods from other planets were visible even to the common man, due to the sacrificial ceremony. The demigods are not generally visible to common men, as the Lord is not visible. But as the Lord, by His causeless mercy, descends to be visible to the common man, similarly the demigods also become visible to the common man by their own grace. Although celestial beings are not visible to the naked eyes of the inhabitants of this earth, it was due to the influence of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it that the demigods also agreed to be visible. The kings used to spend lavishly during such sacrifices, as a cloud distributes rains. A cloud is nothing but another form of water, or, in other words, the waters of the earth transform into clouds. Similarly, the charity made by the kings in such sacrifices was but another form of the taxes collected from the citizens. But, as the rains fall down very lavishly and appear to be more than necessary, the charity made by such kings also seems to be more than what the citizen needs. Satisfied citizens will never organize agitation against the king, and thus there was no need in changing the monarchial state. Even for a king like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it there was need of a spiritual master for guidance. Without such guidance one cannot make progress in spiritual life. The spiritual master must be bona fide, and one who wants to have self-realization must approach and take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master to achieve real success."

Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it went out to conquer the world after his ascendance to the throne, but this was not for the purpose of aggression on other states. He was the Emperor of the world, and all small states were already under his regime. His purpose in going out was to see how things were going on in terms of the godly state. The king, being the representative of the Lord, has to execute the will of the Lord duly. There is no question of self-aggrandizement. Thus as soon as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it saw that a lower-class man in the dress of a king was hurting the legs of a cow and a bull, at once he arrested and punished him. The king cannot tolerate insults to the most important animal, the cow, nor can he tolerate disrespect for the most important man, the br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Human civilization means to advance the cause of brahminical culture, and to maintain it, cow protection is essential. There is a miracle in milk, for it contains all the necessary vitamins to sustain human physiological conditions for higher achievements. Brahminical culture can advance only when man is educated to develop the quality of goodness, and for this there is a prime necessity of food prepared with milk, fruits and grains. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was astonished to see that a black \u015b\u016bdra, dressed like a ruler, was mistreating a cow, the most important animal in human society. The Age of Kali means mismanagement and quarrel. And the root cause of all mismanagement and quarrel is that worthless men with the modes of lower-class men, who have no higher ambition in life, come to the helm of the state management. Such men at the post of a king are sure to first hurt the cow and the brahminical culture, thereby pushing all society towards hell. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, trained as he was, got the scent of this root cause of all quarrel in the world. Thus he wanted to stop it in the very beginning."

This suggests that a pious king like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it should have at once killed an offender who wanted to cheat the public by dressing like a king and at the same time daring to insult the purest of the animals, a cow. The \u1e5b\u1e63is in those days, however, could not even imagine that in the advanced days of the Age of Kali the lowest of the \u015b\u016bdras will be elected as administrators and will open organized slaughterhouses for killing cows. Anyway, although hearing about a \u015b\u016bdraka who was a cheat and insulter of a cow was not very interesting to the great \u1e5b\u1e63is, they nevertheless wanted to hear about it to see if the event had any connection with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They were simply interested in the topics of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for anything that is dovetailed with the narration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worth hearing. There are many topics in the Bh\u0101gavatam about sociology, politics, economics, cultural affairs, etc., but all of them are in relation with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore all of them are worth hearing. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the purifying ingredient in all matters, regardless of what they are. In the mundane world, everything is impure due to its being a product of the three mundane qualities.

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotees are both on the transcendental plane; therefore the topics of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and of His pure devotees are equally good. The Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra is full of politics and diplomacy, but because the topics are related with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is therefore adored all over the world. There is no need to eradicate politics, economics, sociology, etc., which are mundane to the mundaners. To a pure devotee, who is actually related with the Lord, such mundane things are transcendental if dovetailed with the Lord or with His pure devotees. We have heard and talked about the activities of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and we now are dealing with the topics of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, but because all these topics are related to the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they are all transcendental, and pure devotees have great interest in hearing them. We have already discussed this matter in connection with the prayers of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. Our duration of life is not very long, and there is no certainty of when we shall be ordered to leave everything for the next stage. Thus it is our duty to see that not a moment of our life is wasted in topics which are not related with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Any topic, however pleasant, is not worth hearing if it is devoid of its relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The spiritual planet, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the eternal abode of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is shaped like the whorl of a lotus flower. Even when the Lord descends to any one of the mundane planets, He does so by manifesting His own abode as it is. Thus His feet remain always on the same big whorl of the lotus flower. His feet are also as beautiful as the lotus flower. Therefore it is said that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has lotus feet. A living being is eternal by constitution. He is, so to speak, in the whirlpool of birth and death due to his contact with material energy. Freed from such material energy, a living entity is liberated and is eligible to return home, back to Godhead. Those who want to live forever without changing their material bodies should not waste valuable time with topics other than those relating to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotees."

The scientist, who puts forward the theory of stopping death by advancement of scientific knowledge, becomes himself a victim of death when he is called by Yamar\u0101ja. What to speak of stopping death, no one can enhance the short period of life even by a fraction of a moment. The only hope of suspending the cruel slaughtering process of Yamar\u0101ja is to call him to hear and chant the holy name of the Lord. Yamar\u0101ja is a great devotee of the Lord, and he likes to be invited to k\u012brtanas and sacrifices by the pure devotees, who are constantly engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus the great sages, headed by \u015aaunaka and others, invited Yamar\u0101ja to attend the sacrifice performed at Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya. This was good for those who did not want to die."

The human form is a special gift of material nature in the course of her enforcing stringent laws of miseries upon the living being. It is a chance to achieve the highest boon of life, namely to get out of the entanglement of repeated birth and death. The intelligent take care of this important gift by strenuously endeavoring to get out of the entanglement. But the less intelligent are lazy and unable to evaluate the gift of the human body to achieve liberation from the material bondage; they become more interested in so-called economic development and work very hard throughout life simply for the sense enjoyment of the temporary body. Sense enjoyment is also allowed to the lower animals by the law of nature, and thus a human being is also destined to a certain amount of sense enjoyment according to his past or present life. But one should definitely try to understand that sense enjoyment is not the ultimate goal of human life. Herein it is said that during the daytime one works \u201cfor nothing\u201d because the aim is nothing but sense enjoyment.

There are so many things manufactured by human energy, but they are all meant for sense enjoyment, and not for getting out of material bondage. And after working hard during the daytime, a tired man either sleeps or engages in sex habits at night. That is the program of materialistic civilized life for the less intelligent. Therefore they are designated herein as lazy, unfortunate and short-lived."

When he learned about this, he did not think the matter very palatable. This did, however, give him a chance to fight. He took up his bow and arrows and prepared himself for military activities.",
        "purport": " The state administration of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was so perfect that he was sitting in his capital peacefully. But he got the news that the symptoms of the Age of Kali had already infiltrated into the jurisdiction of his state, and he did not like this news. What are the symptoms of the Age of Kali? They are (1) illicit connection with women, (2) indulgence in meat-eating, (3) intoxication and (4) taking pleasure in gambling. The Age of Kali literally means the age of quarrel, and the above-mentioned four symptoms in human society are the root causes for all kinds of quarrel. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it heard that some of the people of the state had already taken to those symptoms, and he wanted to take immediate steps against such causes of unrest. This means that at least up to the regime of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, such symptoms of public life were practically unknown, and as soon as they were slightly detected, he wanted to root them out. The news was not palatable for him, but in a way it was, because Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it got a chance to fight. There was no need to fight with small states because everyone was peacefully under his subordination, but the Kali-yuga miscreants gave his fighting spirit a chance for exhibition. A perfect k\u1e63atriya king is always jubilant as soon as he gets a chance to fight, just as a sportsman is eager when there is a chance for a sporting match. It is no argument that in the Age of Kali such symptoms are predestined. If so, then why was there preparation for fighting out such symptoms? Such arguments are offered by lazy and unfortunate men. In the rainy season, rain is predestined, and yet people take precautions to protect themselves. Similarly, in the Age of Kali the symptoms as above mentioned are sure to infiltrate into social life, but it is the duty of the state to save the citizens from the association of the agents of the Age of Kali. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it wanted to punish the miscreants indulging in the symptoms of Kali, and thus save the innocent citizens who were pure in habit by culture of religion. It is the duty of the king to give such protection, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was perfectly right when he prepared himself to fight."

        "purport": " Bhadr\u0101\u015bva: It is a tract of land near Meru Parvata, and it extends from Gandha-m\u0101dana Parvata to the saltwater ocean. There is a description of this var\u1e63a in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (Bh\u012b\u1e63ma-parva 7.14-18). The description was narrated by Sa\u00f1jaya to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira also conquered this var\u1e63a, and thus the province was included within the jurisdiction of his empire. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was formerly declared to be the emperor of all lands ruled by his grandfather, but still he had to establish his supremacy while he was out of his capital to exact tribute from such states. Ketum\u0101la: This earth planet is divided into seven dv\u012bpas by seven oceans, and the central dv\u012bpa, called Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa, is divided into nine var\u1e63as, or parts, by eight huge mountains. Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a is one of the above-mentioned nine var\u1e63as, and Ketum\u0101la is also described as one of the above var\u1e63as. It is said that in Ketum\u0101la var\u1e63a, women are the most beautiful. This var\u1e63a was conquered by Arjuna also. A description of this part of the world is available in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (Sabh\u0101 28.6). It is said that this part of the world is situated on the western side of the Meru Parvata, and inhabitants of this province used to live up to ten thousand years (Bh\u012b\u1e63ma-parva 6.31). Human beings living in this part of the globe are of golden color, and the women resemble the angels of heaven. The inhabitants are free from all kinds of diseases and grief. Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a: This part of the world is also one of the nine var\u1e63as of the Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa. A description of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a is given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (Bh\u012b\u1e63ma-parva, Chapters 9 and 10). In the center of Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa is Il\u0101v\u1e5bta-var\u1e63a, and south of Il\u0101v\u1e5bta-var\u1e63a is Hari-var\u1e63a. The description of these var\u1e63as is given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (Sabh\u0101-parva 28.7-8) as follows: It is mentioned here that the women in both these var\u1e63as are beautiful, and some of them are equal to the Apsar\u0101s, or heavenly women. Uttarakuru: According to Vedic geography the northernmost portion of Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa is called Uttarakuru-var\u1e63a. It is surrounded by the saltwater ocean from three sides and divided by \u015a\u1e5b\u1e45gav\u0101n Mountain from the Hira\u1e47maya-var\u1e63a. Kimpuru\u1e63a-var\u1e63a: It is stated to be situated north of the great Him\u0101laya Mountain, which is eighty thousand miles in length and height and which covers sixteen thousand miles in width. These parts of the world were also conquered by Arjuna (Sabh\u0101 28.1-2). The Kimpuru\u1e63as are descendants of a daughter of Dak\u1e63a. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira performed a horse sacrifice yaj\u00f1a, the inhabitants of these countries were also present to take part in the festival, and they paid tributes to the Emperor. This part of the world is called Kimpuru\u1e63a-var\u1e63a, or sometimes the Him\u0101layan provinces (Himavat\u012b). It is said that \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was born in these Him\u0101layan provinces and that he came to Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a after crossing the Him\u0101layan countries. In other words, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it conquered all the world. He conquered all the continents adjoining all the seas and oceans in all directions, namely the eastern, western, northern and southern parts of the world."

        "purport": " Kings and great personalities of the state are presented with welcome addresses. This is a system from time immemorial, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, since he was one of the well-known emperors of the world, was also presented with addresses of welcome in all parts of the world as he visited those places. The subject matter of those welcome addresses was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His eternal devotees, as the king means the king and his confidential associates. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His unalloyed devotees cannot be separated, and therefore glorifying the devotee means glorifying the Lord and vice versa. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it would not have been glad to hear about the glories of his forefathers like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and Arjuna had they not been connected with the acts of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord descends specifically to deliver His devotees (paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101m). The devotees are glorified by the presence of the Lord because they cannot live for a moment without the presence of the Lord and His different energies. The Lord is present for the devotee by His acts and glories, and therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it felt the presence of the Lord when He was glorified by His acts, especially when he was saved by the Lord in the womb of his mother. The devotees of the Lord are never in danger, but in the material world which is full of dangers at every step, the devotees are apparently placed into dangerous positions, and when they are saved by the Lord, the Lord is glorified. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would not have been glorified as the speaker of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 had His devotees like the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas not been entangled in the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. All such acts of the Lord were mentioned in the addresses of welcome, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, in full satisfaction, rewarded those who presented such addresses. The difference between the presentation of welcome addresses today and in those days is that formerly the welcome addresses were presented to a person like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. The welcome addresses were full of facts and figures, and those who presented such addresses were sufficiently rewarded, whereas in the present days the welcome addresses are presented not always with factual statements but to please the post holder, and often they are full of flattering lies. And rarely are those who present such welcome addresses rewarded by the poor receiver."

Simply by appreciating the dealings of the Lord with His pure devotees, one can attain salvation. The Lord\u2019s dealings with His devotees appear to be ordinary human dealings, but one who knows them in truth becomes at once eligible to go back home, back to Godhead. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were so malleable to the will of the Lord that they could sacrifice any amount of energy for the service of the Lord, and by such unalloyed determination they could secure the Lord\u2019s mercy in any shape they desired."

When the bull and the cow are in a joyful mood, it is to be understood that the people of the world are also in a joyful mood. The reason is that the bull helps production of grains in the agricultural field, and the cow delivers milk, the miracle of aggregate food values. The human society, therefore, maintains these two important animals very carefully so that they can wander everywhere in cheerfulness. But at the present moment in this Age of Kali both the bull and the cow are now being slaughtered and eaten up as foodstuff by a class of men who do not know the brahminical culture. The bull and the cow can be protected for the good of all human society simply by the spreading of brahminical culture as the topmost perfection of all cultural affairs. By advancement of such culture, the morale of society is properly maintained, and so peace and prosperity are also attained without extraneous effort.

The particular symptom of the Age of Kali is that no family is now blessed to live together. To earn a livelihood, the father lives at a place far away from the son, or the wife lives far away from the husband and so on. There are sufferings from internal diseases, separation from those near and dear, and anxieties for maintaining the status quo.

Or are you in great anxiety because henceforward the unlawful meat-eaters will exploit you? Or are you in a sorry plight because the demigods are now bereft of their share of sacrificial offerings because no sacrifices are being performed at present? Or are you grieving for living beings because of their sufferings due to famine and drought?",
        "purport": " With the progress of the Age of Kali, four things particularly, namely the duration of life, mercy, the power of recollection, and moral or religious principles will gradually diminish. Since Dharma, or the principles of religion, would be lost in the proportion of three out of four, the symbolic bull was standing on one leg only. When three fourths of the population of the whole world become irreligious, the situation is converted into hell for the animals. In the Age of Kali, godless civilizations will create so many so-called religious societies in which the Personality of Godhead will be directly or indirectly defied. And thus faithless societies of men will make the world uninhabitable for the saner section of people. There are gradations of human beings in terms of proportionate faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The first-class faithful men are the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, then the k\u1e63atriyas, then the vai\u015byas, then the \u015b\u016bdras, then the mlecchas, the yavanas and at last the ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las. The degradation of the human instinct begins from the mlecchas, and the ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la state of life is the last word in human degradation. All the above terms mentioned in the Vedic literatures are never meant for any particular community or birth. They are different qualifications of human beings in general. There is no question of birthright or community. One can acquire the respective qualifications by one\u2019s own efforts, and thus the son of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava can become a mleccha, or the son of a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la can become more than a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, all in terms of their association and intimate relation with the Supreme Lord. The meat-eaters are generally called mlecchas. But all meat-eaters are not mlecchas. Those who accept meat in terms of scriptural injunctions are not mlecchas, but those who accept meat without restriction are called mlecchas. Beef is forbidden in the scriptures, and the bulls and cows are offered special protection by followers of the Vedas. But in this Age of Kali, people will exploit the body of the bull and the cow as they like, and thus they will invite sufferings of various types. The people of this age will not perform any sacrifice. The mleccha population will care very little for performances of sacrifices, although performance of sacrifice is essential for persons who are materially engaged in sense enjoyment. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.14-16)performance of sacrifices is strongly recommended. The living beings are created by the creator Brahm\u0101, and just to maintain the created living being progressively towards the path back to Godhead, the system of performing sacrifice is also created by him. The system is that living beings live on the produce of grains and vegetables, and by eating such foodstuff they get vital power of the body in the shape of blood and semen, and from blood and semen one living being is able to create other living beings. But the production of grains, grass, etc., becomes possible by rain, and this rain is made to shower properly by performance of recommended sacrifices. Such sacrifices are directed by the rites of the Vedas, namely S\u0101ma, Yajur, \u1e5ag and Atharva. In the Manu-sm\u1e5bti it is recommended that by offerings of sacrifice on the altar of the fire, the sun-god is pleased. When the sun-god is pleased, he properly collects water from the sea, and thus sufficient clouds collect on the horizon and rains fall. After sufficient rains fall, there is sufficient production of grains for men and all animals, and thus there is energy in the living being for progressive activity. The mlecchas, however, make plans to install slaughterhouses for killing bulls and cows along with other animals, thinking that they will prosper by increasing the number of factories and live on animal food without caring for performance of sacrifices and production of grains. But they must know that even for the animals they must produce grass and vegetables, otherwise the animals cannot live. And to produce grass for the animals, they require sufficient rains. Therefore they have to depend ultimately on the mercy of the demigods like the sun-god, Indra and Candra, and such demigods must be satisfied by performances of sacrifice. This material world is a sort of prison house, as we have several times mentioned. The demigods are the servants of the Lord who see to the proper upkeep of the prison house. These demigods want to see that the rebel living beings, who want to survive faithlessly, are gradually turned towards the supreme power of the Lord. Therefore, the system of offering sacrifice is recommended in the scriptures. The materialistic men want to work hard and enjoy fruitive results for sense enjoyment. Thus they are committing many types of sins at every step of life. Those, however, who are consciously engaged in the devotional service of the Lord are transcendental to all varieties of sin and virtue. Their activities are free from the contamination of the three modes of material nature. For the devotees there is no need for performance of prescribed sacrifices because the very life of the devotee is a symbol of sacrifice. But persons who are engaged in fruitive activities for sense enjoyment must perform the prescribed sacrifices because that is the only means to get free from the reaction of all sins committed by fruitive workers. Sacrifice is the means for counteracting such accumulated sins. The demigods are pleased when such sacrifices are performed, just as prison officers are satisfied when the prisoners are turned into obedient subjects. Lord Caitanya, however, has recommended only one yaj\u00f1a, or sacrifice, called the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in which everyone can take part. Thus both devotees and fruitive workers can derive equal benefit from the performances of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a."

The administrative heads as a class will condemn the tenets of Vedic wisdom and will prefer to conduct a so-called secular state, and the so-called educated br\u0101hma\u1e47as will be purchased by such unscrupulous administrators. Even a philosopher and writer of many books on religious principles may also accept an exalted post in a government which denies all the moral codes of the \u015b\u0101stras.

In this age, the fathers and the guardians are not happy with the behavior of their wards. They should know that so many innocent children are victims of bad association awarded by the influence of this Age of Kali. We know from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that Aj\u0101mila, an innocent son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, was walking down a road and saw a \u015b\u016bdra pair sexually embracing. This attracted the boy, and later on the boy became a victim of all debaucheries. From a pure br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he fell down to the position of a wretched urchin, and it was all due to bad association. There was but one victim like Aj\u0101mila in those days, but in this Age of Kali the poor innocent students are daily victims of cinemas which attract men only for sex indulgence. The so-called administrators are all untrained in the affairs of a k\u1e63atriya. The k\u1e63atriyas are meant for administration, as the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are meant for knowledge and guidance. The word k\u1e63atra-bandhu refers to the so-called administrators or persons promoted to the post of the administrator without proper training by culture and tradition. Nowadays they are promoted to such exalted posts by the votes of the people who are themselves fallen in the rules and regulations of life. How can such people select a proper man when they are themselves fallen in the standard of life? Therefore, by the influence of the Age of Kali, everywhere, politically, socially or religiously, everything is topsy-turvy, and therefore for the sane man it is all regrettable."

That Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of all goodness and beauty, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has now closed His transcendental pastimes on the face of the earth. In His absence the Age of Kali has spread its influence everywhere, so I am sorry to see this condition of existence.",
        "purport": " Even if it were possible to count the atoms after smashing the earth into powder, still it would not be possible to estimate the unfathomable transcendental qualities of the Lord. It is said that Lord Anantadeva has tried to expound the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord with His numberless tongues, and that for numberless years together it has been impossible to estimate the qualities of the Lord. The above statement of the qualities of the Lord is just to estimate His qualities as far as a human being is able to see Him. But even if it is so, the above qualities can be divided into many subheadings. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the third quality, intolerance of another\u2019s unhappiness, can be subdivided into (1) protection of the surrendered souls and (2) well wishes for the devotees. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord states that He wants every soul to surrender unto Him only, and He assures everyone that if one does so He will give protection from the reactions of all sins. Unsurrendered souls are not devotees of the Lord, and thus there is no particular protection for everyone in general. For the devotees He has all good wishes, and for those who are actually engaged in loving transcendental service of the Lord, He gives particular attention. He gives direction to such pure devotees to help them discharge their responsibilities on the path back to Godhead. By equality (10), the Lord is equally kind to everyone, as the sun is equal in distributing its rays over everyone. Yet there are many who are unable to take advantage of the sun\u2019s rays. Similarly, the Lord says that surrendering unto Him is the guarantee for all protection from Him, but unfortunate persons are unable to accept this proposition, and therefore they suffer from all material miseries. So even though the Lord is equally well-wishing to everyone, the unfortunate living being, due to bad association only, is unable to accept His instructions in toto, and for this the Lord is never to be blamed. He is called the well-wisher for the devotees only. He appears to be partial to His devotees, but factually the matter rests on the living being to accept or reject equal treatment by the Lord. The Lord never deviates from His word of honor. When He gives assurance for protection, the promise is executed in all circumstances. It is the duty of the pure devotee to be fixed in the discharge of the duty entrusted to him by the Lord or the Lord\u2019s bona fide representative, the spiritual master. The rest is carried on by the Lord without a break. The responsibility of the Lord is also unique. The Lord has no responsibility because all His work is done by His different appointed energies. But still He accepts voluntary responsibilities in displaying different roles in His transcendental pastimes. As a boy, He was playing the part of a cowboy. As the son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, He discharged responsibility perfectly. Similarly, when He was playing the part of a k\u1e63atriya as the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Vasudeva, He displayed all the skill of a martially spirited k\u1e63atriya. In almost all cases, the k\u1e63atriya king has to secure a wife by fighting or kidnapping. This sort of behavior for a k\u1e63atriya is praiseworthy in the sense that a k\u1e63atriya must show his power of chivalry to his would-be wife so that the daughter of a k\u1e63atriya can see the valor of her would-be husband. Even the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b R\u0101ma displayed such a spirit of chivalry during His marriage. He broke the strongest bow, called Haradhanur, and achieved the hand of S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b, the mother of all opulence. The k\u1e63atriya spirit is displayed during marriage festivals, and there is nothing wrong in such fighting. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a discharged such responsibility fully because although He had more than sixteen thousand wives, in each and every case He fought like a chivalrous k\u1e63atriya and thus secured a wife. To fight sixteen thousand times to secure sixteen thousand wives is certainly possible only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, He displayed full responsibility in every action of His different transcendental pastimes. The fourteenth quality, knowledge, can be further extended into five subheadings, namely (1) intelligence, (2) gratefulness, (3) power of understanding the circumstantial environments of place, object and time, (4) perfect knowledge of everything, and (5) knowledge of the self. Only fools are ungrateful to their benefactors. The Lord, however, does not require benefit from anyone besides Himself because He is full in Himself; still He feels benefited by the unalloyed services of His devotees. The Lord feels grateful to His devotees for such unsophisticated, unconditional service and tries to reciprocate it by rendering service, although the devotee also has no such desire in his heart. The transcendental service of the Lord is itself a transcendental benefit for the devotee, and therefore the devotee has nothing to expect from the Lord. On the assertion of the Vedic aphorism sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma, we can understand that the Lord, by the omnipresent rays of His effulgence, called brahmajyoti, is all-pervading inside or outside of everything, like the omnipresent material sky, and thus He is also omniscient. As far as the beauty of the Lord is concerned, He has some special features that distinguish Him from all other living beings, and over and above that He has some special attractive beautiful features by which He attracts the mind of even R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, the supermost beautiful creation of the Lord. He is known, therefore, as Madana-mohana, or one who attracts the mind of even Cupid. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b Prabhu has scrutinizingly analyzed other transcendental qualities of the Lord and affirms that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead (Parabrahman). He is omnipotent by His inconceivable energies, and therefore He is the Yoge\u015bvara, or the supreme master of all mystic powers. Being the Yoge\u015bvara, His eternal form is spiritual, a combination of eternity, bliss and knowledge. The nondevotee class cannot understand the dynamic nature of His knowledge because they are satisfied to reach up to His eternal form of knowledge. All great souls aspire to be equal in knowledge with Him. This means that all other knowledge is ever insufficient, flexible and measurable, whereas the knowledge of the Lord is ever fixed and unfathomable. \u015ar\u012bla S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b affirms in the Bh\u0101gavatam that although He was observed by the citizens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 every day, they were ever increasingly anxious to see Him again and again. The living beings can appreciate the qualities of the Lord as the ultimate goal, but they cannot attain the status quo of such equality. This material world is a product of the mahat-tattva, which is a state of the Lord\u2019s dreaming condition in His yoga-nidr\u0101 mystic slumber in the Causal Ocean, and yet the whole creation appears to be a factual presentation of His creation. This means that the Lord\u2019s dreaming conditions are also factual manifestations. He can therefore bring everything under His transcendental control, and thus whenever and wherever He does appear, He does so in His fullness. The Lord, being all that is described above, maintains the affairs of the creation, and by His so doing He gives salvation even to His enemies who are killed by Him. He is attractive even to the topmost liberated soul, and thus He is worshipable even by Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, the greatest of all demigods. Even in His incarnation of puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ra He is the Lord of the creative energy. The creative material energy is working under His direction, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10). He is the control switch of the material energy, and to control the material energy in the innumerable universes, He is the root cause of innumerable incarnations in all the universes. There are more than five hundred thousand incarnations of Manu in only one universe, besides other incarnations in different universes. In the spiritual world, however, beyond the mahat-tattva, there is no question of incarnations, but there are plenary expansions of the Lord in different Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas. The planets in the spiritual sky are at least three times the number of those within the innumerable universes in the mahat-tattva. And all the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a forms of the Lord are but expansions of His V\u0101sudeva feature, and thus He is V\u0101sudeva, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a simultaneously. He is \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a govinda hare mur\u0101re he n\u0101tha n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a v\u0101sudeva, all in one. His qualities, therefore, cannot be counted by anyone, however great one may be."

The distinction between human life and animal life therefore begins with the scientific system of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama, guided by the experience of the sages in relation with the demigods, gradually rising to the summit of reestablishing our eternal relation with the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When God-made var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, which is strictly meant for developing animal consciousness into human consciousness and human consciousness into godly consciousness, is broken by advancement of foolishness, the whole system of peaceful and progressive life is at once disturbed. In the Age of Kali, the first attack of the venomous snake strikes against the God-made var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, and thus a person properly qualified as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is called a \u015b\u016bdra, and a \u015b\u016bdra by qualification is passing as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, all on a false birthright claim. To become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by a birthright claim is not at all bona fide, although it may be a fulfillment of one of the conditions. But the real qualification of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is to control the mind and the senses, and to cultivate tolerance, simplicity, cleanliness, knowledge, truthfulness, devotion and faith in the Vedic wisdom. In the present age, consideration of the necessary qualification is being neglected, and the false birthright claim is being supported even by a popular, sophisticated poet, the author of R\u0101ma-carita-m\u0101nasa. This is all due to the influence of the Age of Kali. Thus mother earth, represented as a cow, was lamenting the regrettable condition."

But at the end, when I felt I was so fortunate, the Lord left me.",
        "purport": " The beauty and opulence of the world can be enhanced by the grace of the Lord and not by any man-made planning. When the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present on this earth, the impressions of the special signs of His lotus feet were stamped on the dust, and as a result of this specific grace, the whole earth was made as perfect as possible. In other words, the rivers, the seas, the forests, the hills and the mines, which are the supplying agents for the necessities of men and animals, were fully discharging their respective duties. Therefore the riches of the world surpassed all the riches of all other planets in the three planetary systems of the universe. One should, therefore, ask that the grace of the Lord always be present on earth so that we may be favored with His causeless mercy and be happy, having all necessities of life. One may ask how we can detain the Supreme Lord on this earth after His mission is fulfilled and He has left this earth for His own abode. The answer is that there is no need to detain the Lord. The Lord, being omnipresent, can be present with us if we want Him at all. By His omnipresence, He can always be with us if we are attached to His devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. There is nothing in the world with which the Lord is disconnected. The only thing we must learn is to excavate the source of connection and thus be linked with Him by offenseless service. We can be connected with Him by the transcendental sound representation of the Lord. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself are identical, and one who chants the holy name of the Lord in an offenseless manner can at once realize that the Lord is present before him. Even by the vibration of radio sound, we can partially realize sound relativity, and by resounding the sound of transcendence we can verily feel the presence of the Lord. In this age, when everything is polluted by the contamination of Kali, it is instructed in the scriptures and preached by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu that by chanting the holy name of the Lord, we can at once be free from contamination and gradually rise to the status of transcendence and go back to Godhead. The offenseless chanter of the holy name of the Lord is as auspicious as the Lord Himself, and the movement of pure devotees of the Lord all over the world can at once change the troublesome face of the world. Only by the propagation of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord can we be immune from all effects of the Age of Kali."
