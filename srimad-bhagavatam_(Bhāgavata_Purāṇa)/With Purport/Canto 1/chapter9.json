They are also spacemen competent to travel in the air without the help of any material vehicle. Parvata Muni is also a devar\u1e63i, or a great sage amongst the demigods, like N\u0101rada. He was present along with N\u0101rada at the sacrificial ceremony of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Janamejaya, son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. In this sacrifice all the snakes of the world were to be killed. Parvata Muni and N\u0101rada Muni are called Gandharvas also because they can travel in the air singing the glories of the Lord. Since they can travel in the air, they observed Draupad\u012b\u2019s svaya\u1e41vara ceremony (selecting of her own husband) from the air. Like N\u0101rada Muni, Parvata Muni also used to visit the royal assembly in the heaven of King Indra. As a Gandharva, sometimes he visited the royal assembly of Kuvera, one of the important demigods. Both N\u0101rada and Parvata were once in trouble with the daughter of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja S\u1e5b\u00f1jaya. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja S\u1e5b\u00f1jaya got the benediction of a son by Parvata Muni. N\u0101rada Muni is inevitably associated with the narrations of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. He is described in the Bh\u0101gavatam. In his previous life he was the son of a maidservant, but by good association with pure devotees he became enlightened in devotional service, and in the next life he became a perfect man comparable with himself only. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata his name is mentioned in many places. He is the principal devar\u1e63i, or the chief sage among the demigods. He is the son and disciple of Brahm\u0101j\u012b, and from him the disciplic succession in the line of Brahm\u0101 has been spread. He initiated Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and many celebrated devotees of the Lord. He initiated even Vy\u0101sadeva, the author of the Vedic literatures, and from Vy\u0101sadeva, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya was initiated, and thus the Madhvasamprad\u0101ya, in which the Gau\u1e0d\u012byasamprad\u0101ya is also included, has spread all over the universe. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu belonged to this Madhva samprad\u0101ya; therefore, Brahm\u0101j\u012b, N\u0101rada, Vy\u0101sa, down to Madhva, Caitanya and the Gosv\u0101m\u012bs all belonged to the same line of disciplic succession. N\u0101radaj\u012b has instructed many kings from time immemorial. In the Bh\u0101gavatam we can see that he instructed Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja while he was in the womb of his mother, and he instructed Vasudeva, father of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as well as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Dhaumya: A great sage who practiced severe penances at Utkocaka T\u012brtha and was appointed royal priest of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava kings. He acted as the priest in many religious functions of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas (sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra), and also each of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas was attended by him at the betrothal of Draupad\u012b. He was present even during the exile of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and used to advise them in circumstances when they were perplexed. He instructed them how to live incognito for one year, and his instructions were strictly followed by the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas during that time. His name is mentioned also when the general funeral ceremony was performed after the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. In the Anu\u1e63\u0101sana-parva of Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (127.15-16), he gave very elaborate religious instructions to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. He was actually the right type of priest of a householder, for he could guide the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas on the right path of religion. A priest is meant for guiding the householder progressively in the right path of \u0101\u015brama-dharma, or the occupational duty of a particular caste. There is practically no difference between the family priest and the spiritual master. The sages, saints and br\u0101hma\u1e47as were especially meant for such functions. B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a (Vy\u0101sadeva): He is known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-dvaip\u0101yana, Dvaip\u0101yana, Satyavat\u012b-suta, P\u0101r\u0101\u015barya, Par\u0101\u015bar\u0101tmaja, B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vedavy\u0101sa, etc. He was the son of Mah\u0101muni Par\u0101\u015bara in the womb of Satyavat\u012b prior to her betrothal with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aantanu, the father of the great general Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. He is a powerful incarnation of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and he broadcasts the Vedic wisdom to the world. As such, Vy\u0101sadeva is offered respects before one chants the Vedic literature, especially the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was his son, and \u1e5b\u1e63is like Vai\u015bamp\u0101yana were his disciples for different branches of the Vedas. He is the author of the great epic Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the great transcendental literature Bh\u0101gavatam. The Brahma-s\u016btras \u2014 the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, or B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a-s\u016btras \u2014 were compiled by him. Amongst sages he is the most respected author by dint of severe penances. When he wanted to record the great epic Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata for the welfare of all people in the Age of Kali, he was feeling the necessity of a powerful writer who could take up his dictation. By the order of Brahm\u0101j\u012b, \u015ar\u012b Ga\u1e47e\u015baj\u012b took up the charge of noting down the dictation on the condition that Vy\u0101sadeva would not stop dictation for a moment. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was thus compiled by the joint endeavor of Vy\u0101sa and Ga\u1e47e\u015ba. By the order of his mother, Satyavat\u012b, who was later married to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aantanu, and by the request of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, the eldest son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u015aantanu by his first wife, the Ganges, he begot three brilliant sons, whose names are Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du and Vidura. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was compiled by Vy\u0101sadeva after the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra and after the death of all the heroes of Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. It was first spoken in the royal assembly of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Janamejaya, the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. B\u1e5bhada\u015bva: An ancient sage who used to meet Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira now and then. First of all he met Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira at K\u0101myavana. This sage narrated the history of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nala. There is another B\u1e5bhada\u015bva, who is the son of the Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku dynasty (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Vana-parva 209.4-5). Bharadv\u0101ja: He is one of the seven great \u1e5b\u1e63is and was present at the time of the birth ceremony of Arjuna. The powerful \u1e5b\u1e63i sometimes undertook severe penances on the shore of the Ganges, and his \u0101\u015brama is still celebrated at Pray\u0101gadh\u0101ma. It is learned that this \u1e5b\u1e63i, while taking bath in the Ganges, happened to meet Gh\u1e5btac\u012b, one of the beautiful society girls of heaven, and thus he discharged semen, which was kept and preserved in an earthen pot and from which Dro\u1e47a was born. So Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya is the son of Bharadv\u0101ja Muni. Others say that Bharadv\u0101ja the father of Dro\u1e47a is a different person from Mahar\u1e63i Bharadv\u0101ja. He was a great devotee of Brahm\u0101. Once he approached Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya and requested him to stop the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Para\u015bur\u0101ma, or Re\u1e47uk\u0101suta: He is the son of Mahar\u1e63i Jamadagni and \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Re\u1e47uk\u0101. Thus he is also known as Re\u1e47uk\u0101suta. He is one of the powerful incarnations of God, and he killed the k\u1e63atriya community as a whole twenty-one times. With the blood of the k\u1e63atriyas he pleased the souls of his forefathers. Later on he underwent severe penances at the Mahendra Parvata. After taking the whole earth from the k\u1e63atriyas, he gave it in charity to Ka\u015byapa Muni. Para\u015bur\u0101ma instructed the Dhanur-veda, or the science of fighting, to Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya because he happened to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. He was present during the coronation of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, and he celebrated the function along with other great \u1e5b\u1e63is. Para\u015bur\u0101ma is so old that he met both R\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at different times. He fought with R\u0101ma, but he accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He also praised Arjuna when he saw him with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When Bh\u012b\u1e63ma refused to marry Amb\u0101, who wanted him to become her husband, Amb\u0101 met Para\u015bur\u0101ma, and by her request only, he asked Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva to accept her as his wife. Bh\u012b\u1e63ma refused to obey his order, although he was one of the spiritual masters of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. Para\u015bur\u0101ma fought with Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva when Bh\u012b\u1e63ma neglected his warning. Both of them fought very severely, and at last Para\u015bur\u0101ma was pleased with Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and gave him the benediction of becoming the greatest fighter in the world. Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha: The great celebrated sage among the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, well known as the Brahmar\u1e63i Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva. He is a prominent figure in both the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata periods. He celebrated the coronation ceremony of the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b R\u0101ma. He was present also on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. He could approach all the higher and lower planets, and his name is also connected with the history of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. There was a great tension between him and Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, who wanted his k\u0101madhenu, wish-fulfilling cow. Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Muni refused to spare his k\u0101madhenu, and for this Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra killed his one hundred sons. As a perfect br\u0101hma\u1e47a he tolerated all the taunts of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra. Once he tried to commit suicide on account of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra\u2019s torture, but all his attempts were unsuccessful. He jumped from a hill, but the stones on which he fell became a stack of cotton, and thus he was saved. He jumped into the ocean, but the waves washed him ashore. He jumped into the river, but the river also washed him ashore. Thus all his suicide attempts were unsuccessful. He is also one of the seven \u1e5b\u1e63is and husband of Arundhat\u012b, the famous star. Indrapramada: Another celebrated \u1e5b\u1e63i. Trita: One of the three sons of Praj\u0101pati Gautama. He was the third son, and his other two brothers were known as Ekat and Dvita. All the brothers were great sages and strict followers of the principles of religion. By dint of severe penances they were promoted to Brahmaloka (the planet where Brahm\u0101j\u012b lives). Once Trita Muni fell into a well. He was an organizing worker of many sacrifices, and as one of the great sages he also came to show respect to Bh\u012b\u1e63maj\u012b at his deathbed. He was one of the seven sages in the Varu\u1e47aloka. He hailed from the Western countries of the world. As such, most probably he belonged to the European countries. At that time the whole world was under one Vedic culture. G\u1e5btsamada: One of the sages of the heavenly kingdom. He was a close friend of Indra, the King of heaven, and was as great as B\u1e5bhaspati. He used to visit the royal assembly of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, and he also visited the place where Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva breathed his last. Sometimes he explained the glories of Lord \u015aiva before Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. He was the son of Vitahavya, and he resembled in features the body of Indra. Sometimes the enemies of Indra mistook him to be Indra and arrested him. He was a great scholar of the \u1e5ag-veda, and thus he was highly respected by the br\u0101hma\u1e47a community. He lived a life of celibacy and was powerful in every respect. Asita: There was a king of the same name, but herein the Asita mentioned is the Asita Devala \u1e5a\u1e63i, a great powerful sage of the time. He explained to his father 1,500,000 verses from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. He was one of the members in the snake sacrifice of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Janamejaya. He was also present during the coronation ceremony of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira along with other great \u1e5b\u1e63is. He also gave Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira instructions while he was on the A\u00f1jana Hill. He was also one of the devotees of Lord \u015aiva. Kak\u1e63\u012bv\u0101n: One of the sons of Gautama Muni and the father of the great sage Candakausika. He was one of the members of Parliament of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Atri: Atri Muni was a great br\u0101hma\u1e47a sage and was one of the mental sons of Brahm\u0101j\u012b. Brahm\u0101j\u012b is so powerful that simply by thinking of a son he can have it. These sons are known as m\u0101nasa-putras. Out of seven m\u0101nasa-putras of Brahm\u0101j\u012b and out of the seven great br\u0101hma\u1e47a sages, Atri was one. In his family the great Pracet\u0101s were also born. Atri Muni had two k\u1e63atriya sons who became kings. King Arthama is one of them. He is counted as one of the twenty-one praj\u0101patis. His wife\u2019s name was Anas\u016by\u0101, and he helped Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it in his great sacrifices. Kau\u015bika: One of the permanent \u1e5b\u1e63i members in the royal assembly of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. He sometimes met Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are several other sages of the same name. Sudar\u015bana: This wheel which is accepted by the Personality of Godhead (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) as His personal weapon is the most powerful weapon, greater than the brahm\u0101stras or similar other disastrous weapons. In some of the Vedic literatures it is said that Agnideva, the fire-god, presented this weapon to Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but factually this weapon is eternally carried by the Lord. Agnideva presented this weapon to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the same way that Rukmi\u1e47\u012b was given by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Rukma to the Lord. The Lord accepts such presentations from His devotees, even though such presentations are eternally His property. There is an elaborate description of this weapon in the \u0100di-parva of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a used this weapon to kill \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la, a rival of the Lord. He also killed \u015a\u0101lva by this weapon, and sometimes He wanted His friend Arjuna to use it to kill his enemies (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Vir\u0101\u1e6da-parva 56.3)."

        "purport": " \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b (Brahmar\u0101ta): The famous son and disciple of \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva, who taught him first the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and then \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b recited 1,400,000 verses of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata in the councils of the Gandharvas, Yak\u1e63as and R\u0101k\u1e63asas, and he recited \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam for the first time in the presence of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. He thoroughly studied all the Vedic literatures from his great father. Thus he was a completely purified soul by dint of his extensive knowledge in the principles of religion. From Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Sabh\u0101-parva (4.11), it is understood that he was also present in the royal assembly of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and at the fasting of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. As a bona fide disciple of \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva, he inquired from his father very extensively about religious principles and spiritual values, and his great father also satisfied him by teaching him the yoga system by which one can attain the spiritual kingdom, the difference between fruitive work and empiric knowledge, the ways and means of attaining spiritual realization, the four \u0101\u015bramas (namely the student life, the householder\u2019s life, the retired life and the renounced life), the sublime position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the process of seeing Him face to face, the bona fide candidate for receiving knowledge, the consideration of the five elements, the unique position of intelligence, the consciousness of the material nature and the living entity, the symptoms of the self-realized soul, the working principles of the material body, the symptoms of the influential modes of nature, the tree of perpetual desire, and psychic activities. Sometimes he went to the sun planet with the permission of his father and N\u0101radaj\u012b. Descriptions of his travel in space are given in the \u015a\u0101nti-parva of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (332). At last he attained the transcendental realm. He is known by different names like Ara\u1e47eya, Aru\u1e47isuta, Vaiy\u0101saki and Vy\u0101s\u0101tmaja. Ka\u015byapa: One of the praj\u0101patis, the son of Mar\u012bci and one of the sons-in-law of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a. He is the father of the gigantic bird Garu\u1e0da, who was given elephants and tortoises as eatables. He married thirteen daughters of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a, and their names are Aditi, Diti, Danu, K\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101, Ari\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101, Suras\u0101, Il\u0101, Muni, Krodhava\u015b\u0101, T\u0101mr\u0101, Surabhi, Saram\u0101 and Timi. He begot many children, both demigods and demons, by those wives. From his first wife, Aditi, all the twelve \u0100dityas were born; one of them is V\u0101mana, the incarnation of Godhead. This great sage, Ka\u015byapa, was also present at the time of Arjuna\u2019s birth. He received a presentation of the whole world from Para\u015bur\u0101ma, and later on he asked Para\u015bur\u0101ma to go out of the world. His other name is Ari\u1e63\u1e6danemi. He lives on the northern side of the universe. \u0100\u1e45girasa: He is the son of Mahar\u1e63i A\u1e45gir\u0101 and is known as B\u1e5bhaspati, the priest of the demigods. It is said that Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya was his partial incarnation. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya was the spiritual master of the demons, and B\u1e5bhaspati challenged him. His son is Kaca, and he delivered the fire weapon first to Bharadv\u0101ja Muni. He begot six sons (like the fire-god) by his wife Candram\u0101s\u012b, one of the reputed stars. He could travel in space, and therefore he could present himself even in the planets of Brahmaloka and Indraloka. He advised the King of heaven, Indra, about conquering the demons. Once he cursed Indra, who thus had to become a hog on the earth and was unwilling to return to heaven. Such is the power of the attraction of the illusory energy. Even a hog does not wish to part with its earthly possessions in exchange for a heavenly kingdom. He was the religious preceptor of the natives of different planets."

Everything, therefore, is controlled by the supreme k\u0101la, a forceful representative of the Lord within the material world. Thus Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira should not be sorry for the inconceivable action of time. Everyone has to bear the actions and reactions of time as long as one is within the conditions of the material world. Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira should not think that he had committed sins in his previous birth and is suffering the consequence. Even the most pious has to suffer the condition of material nature. But a pious man is faithful to the Lord, for he is guided by the bona fide br\u0101hma\u1e47a and Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava following the religious principles. These three guiding principles should be the aim of life. One should not be disturbed by the tricks of eternal time. Even the great controller of the universe, Brahm\u0101j\u012b, is also under the control of that time; therefore, one should not grudge being thus controlled by time despite being a true follower of religious principles."

        "purport": " The Vedic system of acquiring knowledge is the deductive process. The Vedic knowledge is received perfectly by disciplic succession from authorities. Such knowledge is never dogmatic, as ill conceived by less intelligent persons. The mother is the authority to verify the identity of the father. She is the authority for such confidential knowledge. Therefore, authority is not dogmatic. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this truth is confirmed in the second verse of the Fourth Chapter, and the perfect system of learning is to receive it from authority. The very same system is accepted universally as truth, but only the false arguer speaks against it. For example, modern spacecraft fly in the sky, and when scientists say that they travel to the other side of the moon, men believe these stories blindly because they have accepted the modern scientists as authorities. The authorities speak, and the people in general believe them. But in the case of Vedic truths, they have been taught not to believe. Even if they accept them they give a different interpretation. Each and every man wants a direct perception of Vedic knowledge, but foolishly they deny it. This means that the misguided man can believe one authority, the scientist, but will reject the authority of the Vedas. The result is that people have degenerated. Here is an authority speaking about \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the original Personality of Godhead and the first N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Even such an impersonalist as \u0100c\u0101rya \u015aa\u1e45kara has said in the beginning of his commentation on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, is beyond the material creation.* The universe is one of the material creations, but N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is transcendental to such material paraphernalia. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva is one of the twelve mah\u0101janas who know the principles of transcendental knowledge. His confirmation of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s being the original Personality of Godhead is also corroborated by the impersonalist \u015aa\u1e45kara. All other \u0101c\u0101ryas have also confirmed this statement, and thus there is no chance of not accepting Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the original Personality of Godhead. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva says that He is the first N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. This is also confirmed by Brahm\u0101j\u012b in the Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.14). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the first N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. In the spiritual world (Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha) there are unlimited numbers of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47as, who are all the same Personality of Godhead and are considered to be the plenary expansions of the original Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The first form of the Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, first expands Himself as the form of Baladeva, and Baladeva expands in so many other forms, such as Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, V\u0101sudeva, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Puru\u1e63a, R\u0101ma and N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha. All these expansions are one and the same vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, and \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original source of all the plenary expansions. He is therefore the direct Personality of Godhead. He is the creator of the material world, and He is the predominating Deity known as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in all the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Therefore, His movements amongst human beings are another sort of bewilderment. The Lord therefore says in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that foolish persons consider Him to be one of the human beings without knowing the intricacies of His movements. The bewilderment regarding \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is due to the action of His twofold internal and external energies upon the third one, called marginal energy. The living entities are expansions of His marginal energy, and thus they are sometimes bewildered by the internal energy and sometimes by the external energy. By internal energetic bewilderment, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expands Himself into unlimited numbers of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47as and exchanges or accepts transcendental loving service from the living entities in the transcendental world. And by His external energetic expansions, He incarnates Himself in the material world amongst the men, animals or demigods to reestablish His forgotten relation with the living entities in different species of life. Great authorities like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, however, escape His bewilderment by the mercy of the Lord."

        "purport": " Pure devotees of the Lord are all budh\u0101s, or persons who know the glories of the Lord in different transcendental loving services. As the Lord has innumerable expansions of His plenary form, there are innumerable pure devotees of the Lord, who are engaged in the exchange of service of different humors. Ordinarily there are twelve great devotees of the Lord, namely Brahm\u0101, N\u0101rada, \u015aiva, Kum\u0101ra, Kapila, Manu, Prahl\u0101da, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Janaka, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Yamar\u0101ja. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, although one of them, has mentioned only three important names of the twelve who know the glories of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, one of the great \u0101c\u0101ryas in the modern age, explains that anubh\u0101va, or the glory of the Lord, is first appreciated by the devotee in ecstasy manifesting the symptoms of perspiring, trembling, weeping, bodily eruptions, etc., which are further enhanced by steady understanding of the glories of the Lord. Such different understandings of bh\u0101vas are exchanged between Ya\u015bod\u0101 and the Lord (binding the Lord by ropes) and in the chariot-driving by the Lord in the exchange of love with Arjuna. These glories of the Lord are exhibited in His being subordinated before His devotees, and that is another feature of the glories of the Lord. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and the Kum\u0101ras, although situated in the transcendental position, became converted by another feature of bh\u0101va and turned into pure devotees of the Lord. Tribulations imposed upon the devotees by the Lord constitute another exchange of transcendental bh\u0101va between the Lord and the devotees. The Lord says, \u201cI put My devotee into difficulty, and thus the devotee becomes more purified in exchanging transcendental bh\u0101va with Me.\u201d Placing the devotee into material troubles means delivering him from the illusory material relations. The material relations are based on reciprocation of material enjoyment, which depends mainly on material resources. Therefore, when material resources are withdrawn by the Lord, the devotee is cent-percent attracted toward the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Thus the Lord snatches the fallen soul from the mire of material existence. Tribulations offered by the Lord to His devotee are different from the tribulations resulting from vicious action. All these glories of the Lord are especially known to the great mah\u0101janas like Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, N\u0101rada, Kapila, Kum\u0101ra and Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, as mentioned above, and one is able to grasp it by their grace."

It is the power of devotional service only that demonstrates Him as the chariot driver or the messenger.

Having unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord as one\u2019s protector, friend and master is the natural condition of eternal life. A living entity is so made by the will of the Almighty that he is most happy when placing himself in a condition of absolute dependence. The opposite tendency is the cause of falldown. The living entity has this tendency of falling down by dint of misidentifying himself as fully independent to lord it over the material world. The root cause of all troubles is there in false egotism. One must draw towards the Lord in all circumstances. The appearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the deathbed of Bh\u012b\u1e63maj\u012b is due to his being an unflinching devotee of the Lord. Arjuna had some bodily relation with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because the Lord happened to be his maternal cousin. But Bh\u012b\u1e63ma had no such bodily relation. Therefore the cause of attraction was due to the intimate relation of the soul. Yet because the relation of the body is very pleasing and natural, the Lord is more pleased when He is addressed as the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda, the son of Ya\u015bod\u0101, the lover of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. This affinity by bodily relation with the Lord is another feature of reciprocating loving service with the Lord. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva is conscious of this sweetness of transcendental humor, and therefore he likes to address the Lord as Vijaya-sakhe, P\u0101rtha-sakhe, etc., exactly like Nanda-nandana or Ya\u015bod\u0101-nandana. The best way to establish our relation in transcendental sweetness is to approach Him through His recognized devotees. One should not try to establish the relation directly; there must be a medium which is transparent and competent to lead us to the right path."

Such a yog\u012b devotee of the Lord engages himself twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord so that his whole attention is engrossed with the thoughts of the Lord in ninefold devotional service, namely hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, praying, becoming a voluntary servant, carrying out orders, establishing a friendly relationship, or offering all that one may possess in the service of the Lord. By such practice of yoga, or linking up in the service of the Lord, one is recognized by the Lord Himself, as it is explained in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 concerning the highest perfectional stage of sam\u0101dhi. The Lord calls such a rare devotee the best amongst all the yog\u012bs. Such a perfect yog\u012b is enabled by the divine grace of the Lord to concentrate his mind upon the Lord with a perfect sense of consciousness, and thus by chanting His holy name before quitting the body the yog\u012b is at once transferred by the internal energy of the Lord to one of the eternal planets where there is no question of material life and its concomitant factors. In material existence a living being has to endure the material conditions of threefold miseries, life after life, according to his fruitive work. Such material life is produced by material desires only. Devotional service to the Lord does not kill the natural desires of the living being, but they are applied in the right cause of devotional service. This qualifies the desire to be transferred to the spiritual sky. General Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva is referring to a particular type of yoga called bhakti-yoga, and he was fortunate enough to have the Lord directly in his presence before he quitted his material body. He therefore desired that the Lord stay before his view in the following verses."

His worshipable Deity was four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, but he knew that four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is a plenary expansion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Indirectly he desired Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to manifest Himself in His four-handed feature of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always humble in his behavior. Although it was cent-percent certain that Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was approaching Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-dh\u0101ma just after leaving his material body, still as a humble Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava he desired to see the beautiful face of the Lord, for after quitting the present body he might not be in a position to see the Lord any more. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is not puffed up, although the Lord guarantees His pure devotee entrance into His abode. Here Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva says \u201cas long as I do not quit this body.\u201d This means that the great general would quit the body by his own will; he was not being forced by the laws of nature. He was so powerful that he could stay in his body as long as he desired. He got this benediction from his father. He desired that the Lord stay before him in His four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a feature so that he might concentrate upon Him and thus be in trance in that meditation. Then his mind might be sanctified with thinking of the Lord. Thus he did not mind wherever he might go. A pure devotee is never very anxious to go back to the kingdom of God. He entirely depends on the good will of the Lord. He is equally satisfied even if the Lord desires him to go to hell. The only desire that a pure devotee entertains is that he may always be in rapt attention with thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord, regardless. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva wanted this much only: that his mind be absorbed in thinking of the Lord and that he pass away thus. That is the highest ambition of a pure devotee."

Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a inspired Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to ask Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva in the presence of many great sages, indicating thereby that the Lord\u2019s devotee like Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, although apparently living as a worldly man, is far superior to many great sages, even Vy\u0101sadeva. Another point is that Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva at that time was not only lying on a deathbed of arrows, but was greatly aggrieved because of that state. One should not have asked him any question at that time, but Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to prove that His pure devotees are always sound in body and mind by dint of spiritual enlightenment, and thus in any circumstances a devotee of the Lord is in perfect order to speak of the right way of life. Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira also preferred to solve his problematic questions by asking Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva rather than ask anyone else present there who was seemingly more learned than Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. This is all due to the arrangement of the great wheel-carrier Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who establishes the glories of His devotee. The father likes to see the son become more famous than himself. The Lord declares very emphatically that worship of His devotee is more valuable than the worship of the Lord Himself."

        "translation": "At Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s inquiry, Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva first defined all the classifications of castes and orders of life in terms of the individual\u2019s qualifications. Then he systematically, in twofold divisions, described counteraction by detachment and interaction by attachment.",
        "purport": " The conception of four castes and four orders of life, as planned by the Lord Himself (Bg. 4.13), is to accelerate transcendental qualities of the individual person so that he may gradually realize his spiritual identity and thus act accordingly to get free from material bondage, or conditional life. In almost all the Pur\u0101\u1e47as the subject matter is described in the same spirit, and so also in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata it is more elaborately described by Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva in the \u015a\u0101nti-parva, beginning from the Sixtieth Chapter. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma is prescribed for the civilized human being just to train him to successfully terminate human life. Self-realization is distinguished from the life of the lower animals engaged in eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva advised for all human beings nine qualifications: (1) not to become angry, (2) not to lie, (3) to equally distribute wealth, (4) to forgive, (5) to beget children only by one\u2019s legitimate wife, (6) to be pure in mind and hygienic in body, (7) not to be inimical toward anyone, (8) to be simple, and (9) to support servants or subordinates. One cannot be called a civilized person without acquiring the above-mentioned preliminary qualities. Besides these, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as (the intelligent men), the administrative men, the mercantile community and the laborer class must acquire special qualities in terms of occupational duties mentioned in all the Vedic scriptures. For the intelligent men, controlling the senses is the most essential qualification. It is the basis of morality. Sex indulgence even with a legitimate wife must also be controlled, and thereby family control will automatically follow. An intelligent man abuses his great qualifications if he does not follow the Vedic way of life. This means he must seriously make a study of the Vedic literatures, especially of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. For learning Vedic knowledge, one must approach a person who is cent-percent engaged in devotional service. He must not do things which are forbidden in the \u015b\u0101stras. A person cannot be a teacher if he drinks or smokes. In the modern system of education the teacher\u2019s academic qualification is taken into consideration without evaluation of his moral life. Therefore, the result of education is misuse of high intelligence in so many ways. The k\u1e63atriya, the member of the administrative class, is especially advised to give charity and not to accept charity in any circumstances. Modern administrators raise subscriptions for some political functions, but never give charity to the citizens in any state function. It is just the reverse in the injunctions of the \u015b\u0101stras. The administrative class must be well versed in the \u015b\u0101stras, but must not take to the profession of teachers. The administrators should never pretend to become nonviolent and thereby go to hell. When Arjuna wanted to become a nonviolent coward on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, he was severely chastised by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord degraded Arjuna at that time to the status of an uncivilized man for his avowed acceptance of the cult of nonviolence. The administrative class must be personally trained in military education. Cowards should not be elevated to the presidential throne by dint of numerical votes only. The monarchs were all chivalrous personalities, and therefore monarchy should be maintained provided the monarch is regularly trained in the occupational duties of a king. In fighting, the king or the president should never return home without being hurt by the enemy. The so-called king of today never visits the warfield. He is very much expert in artificially encouraging the fighting strength in the hope of false national prestige. As soon as the administrative class is turned into a gang of mercantile and laborer men, the whole machinery of government becomes polluted. The vai\u015byas, the members of the mercantile communities, are especially advised to protect the cows. Cow protection means increasing the milk productions, namely curd and butter. Agriculture and distribution of the foodstuff are the primary duties of the mercantile community backed by education in Vedic knowledge and trained to give in charity. As the k\u1e63atriyas were given charge of the protection of the citizens, vai\u015byas were given the charge of the protection of animals. Animals are never meant to be killed. Killing of animals is a symptom of barbarian society. For a human being, agricultural produce, fruits and milk are sufficient and compatible foodstuffs. The human society should give more attention to animal protection. The productive energy of the laborer is misused when he is occupied by industrial enterprises. Industry of various types cannot produce the essential needs of man, namely rice, wheat, grains, milk, fruits and vegetables. The production of machines and machine tools increases the artificial living fashion of a class of vested interests and keeps thousands of men in starvation and unrest. This should not be the standard of civilization. The \u015b\u016bdra class is less intelligent and should have no independence. They are meant for rendering sincere service to the three higher sections of the society. The \u015b\u016bdra class can attain all comforts of life simply by rendering service to the higher classes. It is especially enjoined that a \u015b\u016bdra should never bank money. As soon as the \u015b\u016bdras accumulate wealth, it will be misused for sinful activities in wine, women and gambling. Wine, women and gambling indicate that the population is degraded to less than \u015b\u016bdra quality. The higher castes should always look after the maintenance of the \u015b\u016bdras, and they should provide them with old and used garments. A \u015b\u016bdra should not leave his master when the master is old and invalid, and the master should keep the servants satisfied in all respects. The \u015b\u016bdras must first of all be satisfied by sumptuous food and clothing before any sacrifice is performed. In this age so many functions are held by spending millions, but the poor laborer is not sumptuously fed or given charity, clothing, etc. The laborers are thus dissatisfied, and so they make agitation. The var\u1e47as are, so to speak, classifications of different occupations, and \u0101\u015brama-dharma is gradual progress on the path of self-realization. Both are interrelated, and one is dependent on the other. The main purpose of \u0101\u015brama-dharma is to awaken knowledge and detachment. The brahmac\u0101r\u012b-\u0101\u015brama is the training ground for the prospective candidates. In this \u0101\u015brama it is instructed that this material world is not actually the home of the living being. The conditioned souls under material bondage are prisoners of matter, and therefore self-realization is the ultimate aim of life. The whole system of \u0101\u015brama-dharma is a means to detachment. One who fails to assimilate this spirit of detachment is allowed to enter into family life with the same spirit of detachment. Therefore, one who attains detachment may at once adopt the fourth order, namely renounced, and thus live on charity only, not to accumulate wealth, but just to keep body and soul together for ultimate realization. Household life is for one who is attached, and the v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa orders of life are for those who are detached from material life. The brahmac\u0101r\u012b-\u0101\u015brama is especially meant for training both the attached and detached."

A brahmac\u0101r\u012b, or student, should perform sacrifices, a householder should give charity, and a person in the retired life or in the renounced order should practice penances and austerities. Those are the general functions of all the \u0101\u015bramas, or orders of life on the path of self-realization. In the brahmac\u0101r\u012b life the training is sufficiently imparted so that one may understand that the world as property belongs to the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead. No one, therefore, can claim to be the proprietor of anything in the world. Therefore, in the life of a householder, which is a sort of license for sex enjoyment, one must give in charity for the service of the Lord. Everyone\u2019s energy is generated or borrowed from the reservoir of energy of the Lord; therefore, the resultant actions of such energy must be given to the Lord in the shape of transcendental loving service for Him. As the rivers draw water from the sea through the clouds and again go down to the sea, similarly our energy is borrowed from the supreme source, the Lord\u2019s energy, and it must return to the Lord. That is the perfection of our energy. The Lord, therefore, in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.27) says that whatever we do, whatever we undergo as penance, whatever we sacrifice, whatever we eat or whatever we give in charity must be offered to Him (the Lord). That is the way of utilizing our borrowed energy. When our energy is utilized in that way, our energy is purified from the contamination of material inebrieties, and thus we become fit for our original natural life of service to the Lord. R\u0101ja-dharma is a great science, unlike modern diplomacy for political supremacy. The kings were trained systematically to become munificent and not merely be tax collectors. They were trained to perform different sacrifices only for the prosperity of the subjects. To lead the praj\u0101s to the attainment of salvation was a great duty of the king. The father, the spiritual master and the king are not to become irresponsible in the matter of leading their subjects to the path of ultimate liberation from birth, death, diseases and old age. When these primary duties are properly discharged, there is no need of government of the people, by the people. In modern days the people in general occupy the administration by the strength of manipulated votes, but they are never trained in the primary duties of the king, and that is also not possible for everyone. Under the circumstances the untrained administrators play havoc to make the subjects happy in all respects. On the other hand, these untrained administrators gradually become rogues and thieves and increase the taxation to finance a top-heavy administration that is useless for all purposes. Actually the qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as are meant to give direction to the kings for proper administration in terms of the scriptures like the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and Dharma-\u015b\u0101stras of Par\u0101\u015bara. A typical king is the ideal of the people in general, and if the king is pious, religious, chivalrous and munificent, the citizens generally follow him. Such a king is not a lazy sensuous person living at the cost of the subjects, but alert always to kill thieves and dacoits. The pious kings were not merciful to dacoits and thieves in the name of nonsensical ahi\u1e41s\u0101 (nonviolence). The thieves and dacoits were punished in an exemplary way so that in the future no one would dare commit such nuisances in an organized form. Such thieves and dacoits were never meant for administration as they are now. The taxation law was simple. There was no force, no encroachment. The king had a right to take one fourth of the production made by the subject. The king had a right to claim a fourth of one\u2019s allotted wealth. One would never grudge parting with it because due to the pious king and religious harmony there was enough natural wealth, namely grains, fruits, flowers, silk, cotton, milk, jewels, minerals, etc., and therefore no one was materially unhappy. The citizens were rich in agriculture and animal husbandry, and therefore they had enough grains, fruits and milk without any artificial needs of soaps and toilets, cinemas and bars. The king had to see that the reserved energy of humanity was properly utilized. Human energy is meant not exactly for fulfilling animal propensities, but for self-realization. The whole government was specifically designed to fulfill this particular purpose. As such, the king had to select properly the cabinet ministers, but not on the strength of voting background. The ministers, the military commanders and even the ordinary soldiers were all selected by personal qualification, and the king had to supervise them properly before they were appointed to their respective posts. The king was especially vigilant to see that the tapasv\u012bs, or persons who sacrificed everything for disseminating spiritual knowledge, were never disregarded. The king knew well that the Supreme Personality of Godhead never tolerates any insult to His unalloyed devotees. Such tapasv\u012bs were trusted leaders even of the rogues and thieves, who would never disobey the orders of tapasv\u012bs. The king would give special protection to illiterates, the helpless and widows of the state. Defense measures were arranged previous to any attack by the enemies. The taxing process was easy, and it was not meant for squandering, but was for strengthening the reserve fund. The soldiers were recruited from all parts of the world, and they were trained for special duties. As far as salvation is concerned, one has to conquer the principles of lust, anger, unlawful desires, avarice and bewilderment. To get freedom from anger, one should learn how to forgive. To be free from unlawful desires one should not make plans. By spiritual culture one is able to conquer sleep. By tolerance only can one conquer desires and avarice. Disturbances from various diseases can be avoided by regulated diets. By self-control one can be free from false hopes, and money can be saved by avoiding undesirable association. By practice of yoga one can control hunger, and worldliness can be avoided by culturing the knowledge of impermanence. Dizziness can be conquered by rising up, and false arguments can be conquered by factual ascertainment. Talkativeness can be avoided by gravity and silence, and by prowess one can avoid fearfulness. Perfect knowledge can be obtained by self-cultivation. One must be free from lust, avarice, anger, dreaming, etc., to actually attain the path of salvation. As far as the women class are concerned, they are accepted as a power of inspiration for men. As such, women are more powerful than men. Mighty Julius Caesar was controlled by a Cleopatra. Such powerful women are controlled by shyness. Therefore, shyness is important for women. Once this control valve is loosened, women can create havoc in society by adultery. Adultery means production of unwanted children known as var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara, who disturb the world. The last item taught by Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was the process of pleasing the Lord. We are all eternal servants of the Lord, and when we forget this essential part of our nature we are put into material conditions of life. The simple process of pleasing the Lord (for the householders especially) is to install the Deity of the Lord at home. By concentrating on the Deity, one may progressively go on with the daily routine work. Worshiping the Deity at home, serving the devotee, hearing the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, residing in a holy place and chanting the holy name of the Lord are all inexpensive items by which one can please the Lord. Thus the subject matter was explained by the grandfather to his grandchildren."

In the Vedas these times are considered auspicious for quitting the body, and they are taken advantage of by the expert mystics who have perfected the system. Perfection of yoga means attainment of such supermental states as to be able to leave the material body as desired. Yog\u012bs can also reach any planet within no time without a material vehicle. The yog\u012bs can reach the highest planetary system within a very short time, and this is impossible for the materialist.

        "purport": " In the momentous hour of leaving his material body, Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva set the glorious example concerning the important function of the human form of life. The subject matter which attracts the dying man becomes the beginning of his next life. Therefore, if one is absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is sure to go back to Godhead without any doubt. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.5-15): 5: And whoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt. 6: Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail. 7: Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting. With your activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me without doubt. 8: He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O P\u0101rtha [Arjuna], is sure to reach Me. 9: One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything, as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest, who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who is inconceivable, and who is always a person. He is luminous like the sun and, being transcendental, is beyond this material nature. 10: One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and in full devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 11: Persons learned in the Vedas, who utter o\u1e41k\u0101ra and who are great sages in the renounced order, enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy. I shall now explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation. 12: The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga. 13: After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable o\u1e41, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets. 14: For one who remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, because of his constant engagement in devotional service. 15: After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yog\u012bs in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection. \u015ar\u012b Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva attained the perfection of quitting his body at will and was fortunate enough to have Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the object of his attention, personally present at the time of death. He therefore fixed his open eyes upon Him. He wanted to see \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for a long time out of his spontaneous love for Him. Because he was a pure devotee, he had very little to do with the detailed performance of yogic principles. Simple bhakti-yoga is enough to bring about perfection. Therefore, the ardent desire of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was to see the person of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the most lovable object, and by the grace of the Lord, \u015ar\u012b Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva had this opportunity at the last stage of his breathing."

Thus all the external activities of his senses at once stopped, and he prayed transcendentally to the controller of all living beings while quitting his material body.",
        "purport": " The material body is a gift of the material energy, technically called illusion. Identification with the material body is due to forgetfulness of our eternal relationship with the Lord. For a pure devotee of the Lord like Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, this illusion was at once removed as soon as the Lord arrived. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is like the sun, and the illusory, external material energy is like darkness. In the presence of the sun there is no possibility that darkness can stand. Therefore, just on the arrival of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all material contamination was completely removed, and Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was thus able to be transcendentally situated by stopping the activities of the impure senses in collaboration with matter. The soul is originally pure and so also the senses. By material contamination the senses assume the role of imperfection and impurity. By revival of contact with the Supreme Pure, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the senses again become freed from material contaminations. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva attained all these transcendental conditions prior to his leaving the material body because of the Lord\u2019s presence. The Lord is the controller and benefactor of all living beings. That is the verdict of all Vedas. He is the supreme eternity and living entity amongst all the eternal living beings.* And He alone provides all the necessities for all kinds of living beings. Thus He provided all facilities to fulfill the transcendental desires of His great devotee Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, who prayed as follows."

He is always self-satisfied, but sometimes, being the leader of the devotees, He enjoys transcendental pleasure by descending to the material world, although from Him only the material world is created.",
        "purport": " Because Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was a statesman, the head of the Kuru dynasty, a great general and a leader of k\u1e63atriyas, his mind was strewn over so many subjects, and his thinking, feeling and willing were engaged in different matters. Now, in order to achieve pure devotional service, he wanted to invest all powers of thinking, feeling and willing entirely in the Supreme Being, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is described herein as the leader of the devotees and all-powerful. Although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Personality of Godhead, He Himself descends to earth to bestow upon His pure devotees the boon of devotional service. He descends sometimes as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is, and sometimes as Lord Caitanya. Both are leaders of the pure devotees. Pure devotees of the Lord have no desire other than the service of the Lord, and therefore they are called s\u0101tvata. The Lord is the chief amongst such s\u0101tvatas. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, therefore, had no other desires. Unless one is purified from all sorts of material desires, the Lord does not become one\u2019s leader. Desires cannot be wiped out, but they have only to be purified. It is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10) by the Lord Himself that He gives His instruction from within the heart of a pure devotee who is constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. Such instruction is given not for any material purpose but only for going back home, back to Godhead. For the ordinary man who wants to lord it over material nature, the Lord only sanctions and becomes a witness of activities, but He never gives the nondevotee instructions for going back to Godhead. That is the difference in dealings by the Lord with different living beings, both the devotee and the nondevotee. He is leader of all the living beings, as the king of the state rules both the prisoners and the free citizens. But His dealings are different in terms of devotee and nondevotee. Nondevotees never care to take any instruction from the Lord, and therefore the Lord is silent in their case, although He witnesses all their activities and awards them the necessary results, good or bad. The devotees are above this material goodness and badness. They are progressive on the path of transcendence, and therefore they have no desire for anything material. The devotee also knows \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the original N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a because Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by His plenary portion, appears as the K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the original source of all material creation. The Lord also desires the association of His pure devotees, and for them only the Lord descends to the earth and enlivens them. The Lord appears out of His own will. He is not forced by the conditions of material nature. He is therefore described here as the vibhu, or the almighty, for He is never conditioned by the laws of material nature."

He has appeared on this earth in His transcendental body, which resembles the bluish color of the tam\u0101la tree. His body attracts everyone in the three planetary systems [upper, middle and lower]. May His glittering yellow dress and His lotus face, covered with paintings of sandalwood pulp, be the object of my attraction, and may I not desire fruitive results.",
        "purport": " When \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by His own internal pleasure appears on earth, He does so by the agency of His internal potency. The attractive features of His transcendental body are desired in all the three worlds, namely the upper, middle and lower planetary systems. Nowhere in the universe are there such beautiful bodily features as those of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore His transcendental body has nothing to do with anything materially created. Arjuna is described here as the conqueror, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as his intimate friend. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, on his bed of arrows after the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, is remembering the particular dress of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a which He put on as the driver of Arjuna\u2019s chariot. While fighting was going on between Arjuna and Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma\u2019s attraction was drawn by the glittering dress of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and indirectly he admired his so-called enemy Arjuna for possessing the Lord as his friend. Arjuna was always a conqueror because the Lord was his friend. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva takes this opportunity to address the Lord as vijaya-sakhe (friend of Arjuna) because the Lord is pleased when He is addressed conjointly with His devotees, who are related with Him in different transcendental humors. While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the charioteer of Arjuna, sun rays glittered on the dress of the Lord, and the beautiful hue created by the reflection of such rays was never forgotten by Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. As a great fighter he was relishing the relation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the chivalrous humor. Transcendental relation with the Lord in any one of the different rasas (humors) is relishable by the respective devotees in the highest ecstasy. Less intelligent mundaners who want to make a show of being transcendentally related with the Lord artificially jump at once to the relation of conjugal love, imitating the damsels of Vrajadh\u0101ma. Such a cheap relation with the Lord exhibits only the base mentality of the mundaner because one who has relished conjugal humor with the Lord cannot be attached to worldly conjugal rasa, which is condemned even by mundane ethics. The eternal relation of a particular soul with the Lord is evolved. A genuine relation of the living being with the Supreme Lord can take any form out of the five principal rasas, and it does not make any difference in transcendental degree to the genuine devotee. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva is a concrete example of this, and it should be carefully observed how the great general is transcendentally related with the Lord."

And because of His labor, beads of sweat wetted His face. All these decorations, intensified by the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows, were enjoyed by Him. Let my mind thus go unto \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
        "purport": " The Lord is the absolute form of eternity, bliss and knowledge. As such, transcendental loving service to the Lord in one of the five principal relations, namely \u015b\u0101nta, d\u0101sya, sakhya, v\u0101tsalya and m\u0101dhurya, i.e., neutrality, servitorship, fraternity, parental affection and conjugal love, is graciously accepted by the Lord when offered to the Lord in genuine love and affection. \u015ar\u012b Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva is a great devotee of the Lord in the relation of servitorship. Thus his throwing of sharp arrows at the transcendental body of the Lord is as good as the worship of another devotee who throws soft roses upon Him. It appears that Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva is repenting the actions he committed against the person of the Lord. But factually the Lord\u2019s body was not at all pained, due to His transcendental existence. His body is not matter. Both He Himself and His body are complete spiritual identity. Spirit is never pierced, burnt, dried, moistened, etc. This is vividly explained in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. So also it is stated in the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a. It is said there that spirit is always uncontaminated and indestructible. It cannot be distressed, nor can it be dried up. When Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in His incarnation appears before us, He seems to be like one of the conditioned souls, materially encaged, just to bewilder the asuras, or the nonbelievers, who are always alert to kill the Lord, even from the very beginning of His appearance. Ka\u1e41sa wanted to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and R\u0101va\u1e47a wanted to kill R\u0101ma, because foolishly they were unaware of the fact that the Lord is never killed, for the spirit is never annihilated. Therefore Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva\u2019s piercing of the body of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a sort of bewildering problem for the nondevotee atheist, but those who are devotees, or liberated souls, are not bewildered. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva appreciated the all-merciful attitude of the Lord because He did not leave Arjuna alone, although He was disturbed by the sharpened arrows of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, nor was He reluctant to come before Bh\u012b\u1e63ma\u2019s deathbed, even though He was ill-treated by him on the battlefield. Bh\u012b\u1e63ma\u2019s repentance and the Lord\u2019s merciful attitude are both unique in this picture. \u015ar\u012b Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a great \u0101c\u0101rya and devotee in the humor of conjugal love with the Lord, remarks very saliently in this regard. He says that the wounds created on the body of the Lord by the sharpened arrows of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva were as pleasing to the Lord as the biting of a fiancee who bites the Lord\u2019s body directed by a strong sense of sex desire. Such biting by the opposite sex is never taken as a sign of enmity, even if there is a wound on the body. Therefore, the fighting as an exchange of transcendental pleasure between the Lord and His pure devotee, \u015ar\u012b Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, was not at all mundane. Besides that, since the Lord\u2019s body and the Lord are identical, there was no possibility of wounds in the absolute body. The apparent wounds caused by the sharpened arrows are misleading to the common man, but one who has a little absolute knowledge can understand the transcendental exchange in the chivalrous relation. The Lord was perfectly happy with the wounds caused by the sharpened arrows of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. The word vibhidyam\u0101na is significant because the Lord\u2019s skin is not different from the Lord. Because our skin is different from our soul, in our case the word vibhidyam\u0101na, or being bruised and cut, would have been quite suitable. Transcendental bliss is of different varieties, and the variety of activities in the mundane world is but a perverted reflection of transcendental bliss. Because everything in the mundane world is qualitatively mundane, it is full of inebrieties, whereas in the absolute realm, because everything is of the same absolute nature, there are varieties of enjoyment without inebriety. The Lord enjoyed the wounds created by His great devotee Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, and because Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva is a devotee in the chivalrous relation, he fixes up his mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in that wounded condition."

This was done simply by His looking at the enemy. Let my mind be fixed upon that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
        "purport": " In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (1.21-25) Arjuna ordered the infallible Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to place his chariot between the phalanxes of the soldiers. He asked Him to stay there until he had finished observing the enemies he had to face in the battle. When the Lord was so asked, He at once did so, just like an order carrier. And the Lord pointed out all the important men on the opposite side, saying, \u201cHere is Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, here is Dro\u1e47a,\u201d and so on. The Lord, being the supreme living being, is never the order supplier or order carrier of anyone, whoever he may be. But out of His causeless mercy and affection for His pure devotees, sometimes He carries out the order of the devotee like an awaiting servant. By executing the order of a devotee, the Lord becomes pleased, as a father is pleased to carry out the order of his small child. This is possible only out of pure transcendental love between the Lord and His devotees, and Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was quite aware of this fact. He therefore addressed the Lord as the friend of Arjuna. The Lord diminished the duration of life of the opposite party by His merciful glance. It is said that all the fighters who assembled on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra attained salvation by personally seeing the Lord at the time of death. Therefore, His diminishing the duration of life of Arjuna\u2019s enemy does not mean that He was partial to the cause of Arjuna. Factually He was merciful to the opposite party because they would not have attained salvation by dying at home in the ordinary course of life. Here was a chance to see the Lord at the time of death and thus attain salvation from material life. Therefore, the Lord is all good, and whatever He does is for everyone\u2019s good. Apparently it was for the victory of Arjuna, His intimate friend, but factually it was for the good of Arjuna\u2019s enemies. Such are the transcendental activities of the Lord, and whoever understands this also gets salvation after quitting this material body. The Lord does no wrong in any circumstance because He is absolute, all good at all times."

The kings and commanders were not so-called presidents or ministers of defense as they are today. They would not stay home while the poor soldiers or mercenaries were fighting face to face. This may be the regulation of modern democracy, but when actual monarchy was prevailing, the monarchs were not cowards elected without consideration of qualification. As it was evident from the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, all the executive heads of both parties, like Dro\u1e47a, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Arjuna and Duryodhana, were not sleeping; all of them were actual participants in the fighting, which was selected to be executed at a place away from the civil residential quarters. This means that the innocent citizens were immune from all effects of fighting between the rival royal parties. The citizens had no business in seeing what was going to happen during such fighting. They were to pay one fourth of their income to the ruler, whether he be Arjuna or Duryodhana. All the commanders of the parties on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra were standing face to face, and Arjuna saw them with great compassion and lamented that he was to kill his kinsmen on the battlefield for the sake of the empire. He was not at all afraid of the giant military phalanx presented by Duryodhana, but as a merciful devotee of the Lord, renunciation of worldly things was natural for him, and thus he decided not to fight for worldly possessions. But this was due to a poor fund of knowledge, and therefore it is said here that his intelligence became polluted. His intelligence could not be polluted at any time because he was a devotee and constant companion of the Lord, as is clear in the Fourth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Apparently Arjuna\u2019s intelligence became polluted because otherwise there would not have been a chance to deliver the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 for the good of all polluted conditioned souls engaged in material bondage by the conception of the false material body. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was delivered to the conditioned souls of the world to deliver them from the wrong conception of identifying the body with the soul and to reestablish the soul\u2019s eternal relation with the Supreme Lord. \u0100tma-vidy\u0101, or transcendental knowledge of Himself, was primarily spoken by the Lord for the benefit of all concerned in all parts of the universe."

        "purport": " The Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was fought on military principles but at the same time in a sporting spirit, like a friend\u2019s fight with another friend. Duryodhana criticized Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, alleging that he was reluctant to kill Arjuna because of paternal affection. A k\u1e63atriya cannot tolerate insults on the principle of fighting. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva therefore promised that the next day he would kill all five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas with special weapons made for the purpose. Duryodhana was satisfied, and he kept the arrows with him to be delivered the next day during the fight. By tricks Arjuna took the arrows from Duryodhana, and Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva could understand that this was the trick of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So he took a vow that the next day K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would have to take up weapons Himself, otherwise His friend Arjuna would die. In the next day\u2019s fighting Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva fought so violently that both Arjuna and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were in trouble. Arjuna was almost defeated; the situation was so tense that he was about to be killed by Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva the very next moment. At that time Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to please His devotee, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, by keeping Bh\u012b\u1e63ma\u2019s promise, which was more important than His own. Seemingly He broke His own promise. He promised before the beginning of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra that He would remain without weapons and would not use His strength for either of the parties. But to protect Arjuna He got down from the chariot, took up the wheel of the chariot and hurriedly rushed at Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva in an angry mood, as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He dropped His covering cloth on the way, and out of great anger He did not know that He had dropped it. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva at once gave up his weapons and stood to be killed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his beloved Lord. The fighting of the day was thus ended at that very moment, and Arjuna was saved. Of course there was no possibility of Arjuna\u2019s death because the Lord Himself was on the chariot, but because Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva wanted to see Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a take up some weapon to save His friend, the Lord created this situation, making Arjuna\u2019s death appear imminent. He stood before Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva to show him that his promise was fulfilled and that He had taken up the wheel."

        "purport": " The dealings of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra are interesting because the activities of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared to be partial to Arjuna and at enmity with Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva; but factually all this was especially meant to show special favor to Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, a great devotee of the Lord. The astounding feature of such dealings is that a devotee can please the Lord by playing the part of an enemy. The Lord, being absolute, can accept service from His pure devotee even in the garb of an enemy. The Supreme Lord cannot have any enemy, nor can a so-called enemy harm Him because He is ajita, or unconquerable. But still He takes pleasure when His pure devotee beats Him like an enemy or rebukes Him from a superior position, although no one can be superior to the Lord. These are some of the transcendental reciprocatory dealings of the devotee with the Lord. And those who have no information of pure devotional service cannot penetrate into the mystery of such dealings. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva played the part of a valiant warrior, and he purposely pierced the body of the Lord so that to the common eyes it appeared that the Lord was wounded, but factually all this was to bewilder the nondevotees. The all-spiritual body cannot be wounded, and a devotee cannot become the enemy of the Lord. Had it been so, Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva would not have desired to have the very same Lord as the ultimate destination of his life. Had Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva been an enemy of the Lord, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could have annihilated him without even moving. There was no need to come before Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva with blood and wounds. But He did so because the warrior devotee wanted to see the transcendental beauty of the Lord decorated with wounds created by a pure devotee. This is the way of exchanging transcendental rasa, or relations between the Lord and the servitor. By such dealings both the Lord and the devotee become glorified in their respective positions. The Lord was so angry that Arjuna checked Him when He was moving towards Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, but in spite of Arjuna\u2019s checking, He proceeded towards Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva as a lover goes to a lover, without caring for hindrances. Apparently His determination was to kill Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, but factually it was to please him as a great devotee of the Lord. The Lord is undoubtedly the deliverer of all conditioned souls. The impersonalists desire salvation from Him, and He always awards them according to their aspiration, but here Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva aspires to see the Lord in His personal feature. All pure devotees aspire for this."

I concentrate my mind upon the chariot driver of Arjuna who stood with a whip in His right hand and a bridle rope in His left, who was very careful to give protection to Arjuna\u2019s chariot by all means. Those who saw Him on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra attained their original forms after death.",
        "purport": " A pure devotee of the Lord constantly sees the presence of the Lord within himself because of being transcendentally related by loving service. Such a pure devotee cannot forget the Lord for a moment. This is called trance. The mystic (yog\u012b) tries to concentrate upon the Supersoul by controlling the senses from all other engagements, and thus he ultimately attains sam\u0101dhi. A devotee more easily attains sam\u0101dhi, or trance, by constantly remembering the Lord\u2019s personal feature along with His holy name, fame, pastimes, etc. Therefore, the concentration of the mystic yog\u012b and that of the devotee are not on the same level. The concentration of the mystic is mechanical, whereas that of the pure devotee is natural in pure love and spontaneous affection. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was a pure devotee, and as a military marshal he constantly remembered the battlefield feature of the Lord as P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi, the chariot driver of Arjuna. Therefore, the Lord\u2019s pastime as P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi is also eternal. The pastimes of the Lord, beginning from His birth at the prison house of Ka\u1e41sa up to the mau\u015bala-l\u012bl\u0101 at the end, all move one after another in all the universes, just as the clock hand moves from one point to another. And in such pastimes His associates like the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and Bh\u012b\u1e63ma are constant eternal companions. So Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva never forgot the beautiful feature of the Lord as P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi, which even Arjuna could not see. Arjuna was behind the beautiful P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi while Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was just in front of the Lord. As far as the military feature of the Lord is concerned, Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva observed this with more relish than Arjuna. All the soldiers and persons on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra attained their original spiritual form like the Lord after their death because by the causeless mercy of the Lord they were able to see Him face to face on that occasion. The conditioned souls rotating in the evolutionary cycle from the aquatics up to the form of Brahm\u0101 are all in the form of m\u0101y\u0101, or the form obtained by one\u2019s own actions and awarded by material nature. The material forms of the conditioned souls are all foreign dresses, and when the conditioned soul becomes liberated from the clutches of material energy, he attains his original form. The impersonalist wants to attain the impersonal Brahman effulgence of the Lord, but that is not at all congenial to the living sparks, parts and parcels of the Lord. Therefore, the impersonalists again fall down and get material forms, which are all false to the spirit soul. A spiritual form like the Lord\u2019s, either two-handed or four-handed, is attained by the devotees of the Lord either in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas or in the Goloka planet, according to the original nature of the soul. This form, which is cent-percent spiritual, is the svar\u016bpa of the living being, and all the living beings who participated on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, on both sides, attained their svar\u016bpa, as confirmed by Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. So Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not merciful only to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas; He was also merciful to the other parties because all of them attained the same result. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva wanted the same facility also, and that was his prayer to the Lord, although his position as an associate of the Lord is assured in all circumstances. The conclusion is that whoever dies looking on the Personality of Godhead within or without attains his svar\u016bpa, which is the highest perfection of life."

        "purport": " By intense ecstasy in loving service, the damsels of Vrajabh\u016bmi attained qualitative oneness with the Lord by dancing with Him on an equal level, embracing Him in nuptial love, smiling at Him in joke, and looking at Him with a loving attitude. The relation of the Lord with Arjuna is undoubtedly praiseworthy for devotees like Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, but the relation of the gop\u012bs with the Lord is still more praiseworthy because of their still more purified loving service. By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna was fortunate enough to have the fraternal service of the Lord as chariot driver, but the Lord did not award Arjuna with equal strength. The gop\u012bs, however, practically became one with the Lord by attainment of equal footing with the Lord. Bh\u012b\u1e63ma\u2019s aspiration to remember the gop\u012bs is a prayer to have their mercy also at the last stage of his life. The Lord is satisfied more when His pure devotees are glorified, and therefore Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva has not only glorified the acts of Arjuna, his immediate object of attraction, but has also remembered the gop\u012bs, who were endowed with unrivalled opportunities for rendering loving service to the Lord. The gop\u012bs\u2019 equality with the Lord should never be misunderstood to be like the s\u0101yujya liberation of the impersonalist. The equality is one of perfect ecstasy where the differential conception is completely eradicated, for the interests of the lover and the beloved become identical."

This happened during my presence, and I remembered the incident in order to keep my mind upon the Lord.",
        "purport": " After gaining victory in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, the Emperor of the world, performed the R\u0101jas\u016bya sacrificial ceremony. The emperor, in those days, upon his ascendance to the throne, would send a challenge horse all over the world to declare his supremacy, and any ruling prince or king was at liberty to accept the challenge and express his tacit willingness either to obey or to disobey the supremacy of the particular emperor. One who accepted the challenge had to fight with the emperor and establish his own supremacy by victory. The defeated king would have to sacrifice his life, making a place for another king or ruler. So Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira also dispatched such challenging horses all over the world, and every ruling prince and king all over the world accepted Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s leadership as the Emperor of the world. After this, all rulers of the world under the regime of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira were invited to participate in the great sacrificial ceremony of R\u0101jas\u016bya. Such performances required hundreds of millions of dollars, and it was not an easy job for a petty king. Such a sacrificial ceremony, being too expensive and also difficult to perform under present circumstances, is now impossible in this Age of Kali. Nor can anyone secure the required expert priesthood to take charge of the ceremony. So, after being invited, all the kings and great learned sages of the world assembled in the capital of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. The learned society, including the great philosophers, religionists, physicians, scientists and all great sages, was invited. That is to say, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the k\u1e63atriyas were the topmost leading men in society, and they were all invited to participate in the assembly. The vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras were unimportant elements in society, and they are not mentioned herein. Due to the change of social activities in the modern age, the importance of men has also changed in terms of occupational positions. So in that great assembly, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the cynosure of neighboring eyes. Everyone wanted to see Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and everyone wanted to pay his humble respects to the Lord. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva remembered all this and was glad that his worshipful Lord, the Personality of Godhead, was present before him in His actual formal presence. So to meditate on the Supreme Lord is to meditate on the activities, form, pastimes, name and fame of the Lord. That is easier than what is imagined as meditation on the impersonal feature of the Supreme. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (12.5) it is clearly stated that to meditate upon the impersonal feature of the Supreme is very difficult. It is practically no meditation or simply a waste of time because very seldom is the desired result obtained. The devotees, however, meditate upon the Lord\u2019s factual form and pastimes, and therefore the Lord is easily approachable by the devotees. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (12.9). The Lord is nondifferent from His transcendental activities. It is indicated also in this \u015bloka that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, while actually present before human society, especially in connection with the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, was accepted as the greatest personality of the time, although He might not have been recognized as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The propaganda that a very great man is worshiped as God after his death is misleading because a man after his death cannot be made into God. Nor can the Personality of Godhead be a human being, even when He is personally present. Both ideas are misconceptions. The idea of anthropomorphism cannot be applicable in the case of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

He is in everyone\u2019s heart. The sun may be perceived differently, but the sun is one.",
        "purport": " Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the one Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He has expanded Himself into His multiplenary portions by His inconceivable energy. The conception of duality is due to ignorance of His inconceivable energy. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11) the Lord says that only the foolish take Him to be a mere human being. Such foolish men are not aware of His inconceivable energies. By His inconceivable energy He is present in everyone\u2019s heart, as the sun is present before everyone all over the world. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature of the Lord is an expansion of His plenary portions. He expands Himself as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s heart by His inconceivable energy, and He also expands Himself as the glowing effulgence of brahmajyoti by expansion of His personal glow. It is stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 that the brahmajyoti is His personal glow. Therefore, there is no difference between Him and His personal glow, brahmajyoti, or His plenary portions as Param\u0101tm\u0101. Less intelligent persons who are not aware of this fact consider brahmajyoti and Param\u0101tm\u0101 to be different from \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This misconception of duality is completely removed from the mind of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, and he is now satisfied that it is Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only who is all in all in everything. This enlightenment is attained by the great mah\u0101tm\u0101s or devotees, as it is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19) that V\u0101sudeva is all in all in everything and that there is no existence of anything without V\u0101sudeva. V\u0101sudeva, or Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the original Supreme Person, as now confirmed by a mah\u0101jana, and therefore both the neophytes and the pure devotees must try to follow in his footsteps. That is the way of the devotional line. The worshipable object of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva is Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi, and that of the gop\u012bs is the same K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as the most attractive \u015ay\u0101masundara. Sometimes less intelligent scholars make a mistake and think that the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and that of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra are different personalities. But for Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva this misconception is completely removed. Even the impersonalist\u2019s object of destination is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the impersonal jyoti, and the yog\u012b\u2019s destination of Param\u0101tm\u0101 is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is both brahmajyoti and localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, but in brahmajyoti or Param\u0101tm\u0101 there is no K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or sweet relations with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In His personal feature K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is both P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi and \u015ay\u0101masundara of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, but in His impersonal feature He is neither in the brahmajyoti nor in the Param\u0101tm\u0101. Great mah\u0101tm\u0101s like Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva realize all these different features of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore they worship Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knowing Him as the origin of all features."

        "purport": " The stage attained by Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva while quitting his material body is called nirvikalpa-sam\u0101dhi because he merged his self into thinking of the Lord and his mind into remembering His different activities. He chanted the glories of the Lord, and by his sight he began to see the Lord personally present before him, and thus all his activities became concentrated upon the Lord without deviation. This is the highest stage of perfection, and it is possible for everyone to attain this stage by practice of devotional service. The devotional service of the Lord consists of nine principles of service activities, and they are (1) hearing, (2) chanting, (3) remembering, (4) serving the lotus feet, (5) worshiping, (6) praying, (7) executing the orders, (8) fraternizing, and (9) fully surrendering. Any one of them or all of them are equally competent to award the desired result, but they require to be practiced persistently under the guidance of an expert devotee of the Lord. The first item, hearing, is the most important item of all, and therefore hearing of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and, later on, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is essential for the serious candidate who wants to attain the stage of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva at the end. The unique situation at Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva\u2019s time of death can be attained, even though Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may not be personally present. His words of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or those of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam are identical with the Lord. They are sound incarnations of the Lord, and one can fully utilize them to be entitled to attain the stage of \u015ar\u012b Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, who was one of the eight Vasus. Every man or animal must die at a certain stage of life, but one who dies like Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva attains perfection, and one who dies forced by the laws of nature dies like an animal. That is the difference between a man and an animal. The human form of life is especially meant for dying like Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva."

        "purport": " To enter into or to become merged into the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute means to enter the original home of the living being. The living beings are all component parts and parcels of the Absolute Personality of Godhead, and therefore they are eternally related with Him as the servitor and the served. The Lord is served by all His parts and parcels, as the complete machine is served by its parts and parcels. Any part of the machine removed from the whole is no longer important. Similarly, any part and parcel of the Absolute detached from the service of the Lord is useless. The living beings who are in the material world are all disintegrated parts and parcels of the supreme whole, and they are no longer as important as the original parts and parcels. There are, however, more integrated living beings who are eternally liberated. The material energy of the Lord, called Durg\u0101-\u015bakti, or the superintendent of the prison house, takes charge of the disintegrated parts and parcels, and thus they undergo a conditioned life under the laws of material nature. When the living being becomes conscious of this fact, he tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and thus the spiritual urge of the living being begins. This spiritual urge is called brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101, or inquiry about Brahman. Principally this brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101 is successful by knowledge, renunciation and devotional service to the Lord. J\u00f1\u0101na, or knowledge, means knowledge of everything of Brahman, the Supreme; renunciation means detachment of material affection, and devotional service is the revival by practice of the original position of the living being. The successful living beings who are eligible to enter into the realm of the Absolute are called the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, the yog\u012bs and the bhaktas. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs enter into the impersonal rays of the Supreme, but the bhaktas enter into the spiritual planets known as the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas. In these spiritual planets the Supreme Lord as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a predominates, and the healthy, unconditioned living beings live there by rendering loving service to the Lord in the capacity of servant, friend, parents and fiancee. There the unconditioned living beings enjoy life in full freedom with the Lord, whereas the impersonalist j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs enter into the impersonal glowing effulgence of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. The Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are all self-illuminating like the sun, and the rays of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are called the brahmajyoti. The brahmajyoti is spread unlimitedly, and the material world is but a covered portion of an insignificant part of the same brahmajyoti. This covering is temporary, and therefore it is a sort of illusion. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, as a pure devotee of the Lord, entered the spiritual realm in one of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets where the Lord in His eternal form of P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi predominates over the unconditioned living beings who are constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. The love and affection which bind the Lord and devotee are exhibited in the case of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva never forgot the Lord in His transcendental feature as the p\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi, and the Lord was present personally before Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva while he was passing to the transcendental world. That is the highest perfection of life."

The body of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva lost its material effects due to being surcharged with spiritual realization, and thus the body was spiritualized as when iron becomes red-hot when in contact with fire. The body of a fully self-realized soul is not, therefore, accepted as material. Special ceremonies are observed for such spiritual bodies. The respect and recognition of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva are never to be imitated by artificial means, as it has become a fashion to observe the so-called jayant\u012b ceremony for any and every common man. According to authorized \u015b\u0101stras, such a jayant\u012b ceremony for an ordinary man, however exalted he may be materially, is an offense to the Lord because jayant\u012b is reserved for the day when the Lord appears on the earth. Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was unique in his activities, and his passing away to the kingdom of God is also unique."

        "purport": " Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was not only a great family head of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, but also he was a great philosopher and friend to him, his brothers and his mother. Since Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, the father of the five brothers headed by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, had died, Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was the most affectionate grandfather of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and caretaker of the widow daughter-in-law Kunt\u012bdev\u012b. Although Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the elder uncle of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, was there to look after them, his affection was more on the side of his hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana. Ultimately a colossal clique was fabricated to deprive the five fatherless brothers of the rightful claim of the kingdom of Hastin\u0101pura. There was great intrigue, common in imperial palaces, and the five brothers were exiled to the wilderness. But Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was always a sincerely sympathetic well-wisher, grandfather, friend and philosopher to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, even up to the last moment of his life. He died very happily by seeing Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to the throne, otherwise he would have long ago quitted his material body, instead of suffering agony over the undue sufferings of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. He was simply waiting for the opportune moment because he was sure and certain that the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du would come out victorious on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, as His Lordship \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was their protector. As a devotee of the Lord, he knew that the Lord\u2019s devotee cannot be vanquished at any time. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was quite aware of all these good wishes of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, and therefore he must have been feeling the great separation. He was sorry for the separation of a great soul, and not for the material body which Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva relinquished. The funeral ceremony was a necessary duty, although Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was a liberated soul. Since Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was without issue, the eldest grandson, namely Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, was the rightful person to perform this ceremony. It was a great boon to Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva that an equally great son of the family undertook the last rites of a great man."

All the Vedic hymns are chanted to please Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15).

After the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, the celebrated couple, having lost all their sons and grandsons, were under the care of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. They were passing their days in great agony over such a heavy loss of life and were practically living the life of ascetics. The death news of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, uncle of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, was another great shock for the King and the Queen, and therefore they required solace from Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was conscious of his duty, and he at once hurried to the spot with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and satisfied the bereaved Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra with kind words, from both himself and the Lord also. G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b was a powerful ascetic, although she was living the life of a faithful wife and a kind mother. It is said that G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b also voluntarily blindfolded her eyes because of the blindness of her husband. A wife\u2019s duty is to follow the husband cent-percent. And G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b was so true to her husband that she followed him even in his perpetual blindness. Therefore in her actions she was a great ascetic. Besides that, the shock she suffered because of the wholesale killing of her one hundred sons and her grandsons also was certainly too much for a woman. But she suffered all this just like an ascetic. G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b, although a woman, is no less than Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva in character.

The king is to see to the welfare of the citizens from all angles of social, political, economic and spiritual upliftment. The king must know that human life is meant for liberating the encaged soul from the bondage of material conditions, and therefore his duty is to see that the citizens are properly looked after to attain this highest stage of perfection. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira followed these principles strictly, as will be seen from the next chapter. Not only did he follow the principles, but he also got approval from his old uncle, who was experienced in political affairs, and that was also confirmed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the speaker of the philosophy of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.

The mass of people, especially in this Age of Kali, are all born \u015b\u016bdras, basically lowborn, ill-trained, unfortunate and badly associated. They themselves do not know the highest perfectional aim of life. Therefore, votes cast by them actually have no value, and thus persons elected by such irresponsible votes cannot be responsible representatives like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira."
