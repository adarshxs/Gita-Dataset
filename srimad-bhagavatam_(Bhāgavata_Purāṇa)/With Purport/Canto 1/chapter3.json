        "translation": "S\u016bta said: In the beginning of the creation, the Lord first expanded Himself in the universal form of the puru\u1e63a incarnation and manifested all the ingredients for the material creation. And thus at first there was the creation of the sixteen principles of material action. This was for the purpose of creating the material universes.",
        "purport": " The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 states that the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, maintains these material universes by extending His plenary expansions. So this puru\u1e63a form is the confirmation of the same principle. The original Personality of Godhead V\u0101sudeva, or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is famous as the son of King Vasudeva or King Nanda, is full with all opulences, all potencies, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation. A part of His opulence is manifested as impersonal Brahman, and a part of His opulence is manifested as Param\u0101tm\u0101. This puru\u1e63a feature of the same Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the original Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation of the Lord. There are three puru\u1e63a features in the material creation, and this form, who is known as the K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is the first of the three. The others are known as the Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and the K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, which we shall know one after another. The innumerable universes are generated from the skin holes of this K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and in each one of the universes the Lord enters as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is also mentioned that the material world is created at certain intervals and then again destroyed. This creation and destruction is done by the supreme will because of the conditioned souls, or the nitya-baddha living beings. The nitya-baddha, or the eternally conditioned souls, have the sense of individuality or aha\u1e45k\u0101ra, which dictates to them sense enjoyment, which they are unable to have constitutionally. The Lord is the only enjoyer, and all others are enjoyed. The living beings are predominated enjoyers. But the eternally conditioned souls, forgetful of this constitutional position, have strong aspirations to enjoy. The chance to enjoy matter is given to the conditioned souls in the material world, and side by side they are given the chance to understand their real constitutional position. Those fortunate living entities who catch the truth and surrender unto the lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva after many, many births in the material world join the eternally liberated souls and thus are allowed to enter into the kingdom of Godhead. After this, such fortunate living entities need not come again within the occasional material creation. But those who cannot catch the constitutional truth are again merged into the mahat-tattva at the time of the annihilation of the material creation. When the creation is again set up, this mahat-tattva is again let loose. This mahat-tattva contains all the ingredients of the material manifestations, including the conditioned souls. Primarily this mahat-tattva is divided into sixteen parts, namely the five gross material elements and the eleven working instruments or senses. It is like the cloud in the clear sky. In the spiritual sky, the effulgence of Brahman is spread all around, and the whole system is dazzling in spiritual light. The mahat-tattva is assembled in some corner of the vast, unlimited spiritual sky, and the part which is thus covered by the mahat-tattva is called the material sky. This part of the spiritual sky, called the mahat-tattva, is only an insignificant portion of the whole spiritual sky, and within this mahat-tattva there are innumerable universes. All these universes are collectively produced by the K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, called also the Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who simply throws His glance to impregnate the material sky."

        "translation": "A part of the puru\u1e63a lies down within the water of the universe, from the navel lake of His body sprouts a lotus stem, and from the lotus flower atop this stem, Brahm\u0101, the master of all engineers in the universe, becomes manifest.",
        "purport": " The first puru\u1e63a is the K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. From His skin holes innumerable universes have sprung up. In each and every universe, the puru\u1e63a enters as the Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. He is lying within the half of the universe which is full with the water of His body. And from the navel of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has sprung the stem of the lotus flower, the birthplace of Brahm\u0101, who is the father of all living beings and the master of all the demigod engineers engaged in the perfect design and working of the universal order. Within the stem of the lotus there are fourteen divisions of planetary systems, and the earthly planets are situated in the middle. Upwards there are other, better planetary systems, and the topmost system is called Brahmaloka or Satyaloka. Downwards from the earthly planetary system there are seven lower planetary systems inhabited by the asuras and similar other materialistic living beings. From Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u there is expansion of the K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is the collective Param\u0101tm\u0101 of all living beings. He is called Hari, and from Him all incarnations within the universe are expanded. Therefore, the conclusion is that the puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ra is manifested in three features \u2014 first the K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b who creates aggregate material ingredients in the mahat-tattva, second the Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b who enters in each and every universe, and third the K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u who is the Param\u0101tm\u0101 of every material object, organic or inorganic. One who knows these plenary features of the Personality of Godhead knows Godhead properly, and thus the knower becomes freed from the material conditions of birth, death, old age and disease, as it is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. In this \u015bloka the subject matter of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is summarized. The Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u lies down in some part of the spiritual sky by His own free will. Thus He lies on the ocean of k\u0101ra\u1e47a, from where He glances over His material nature, and the mahat-tattva is at once created. Thus electrified by the power of the Lord, the material nature at once creates innumerable universes, just as in due course a tree decorates itself with innumerable grown fruits. The seed of the tree is sown by the cultivator, and the tree or creeper in due course becomes manifested with so many fruits. Nothing can take place without a cause. The K\u0101ra\u1e47a Ocean is therefore called the Causal Ocean. K\u0101ra\u1e47a means \u201ccausal.\u201d We should not foolishly accept the atheistic theory of creation. The description of the atheists is given in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The atheist does not believe in the creator, but he cannot give a good theory to explain the creation. Material nature has no power to create without the power of the puru\u1e63a, just as a prak\u1e5bti, or woman, cannot produce a child without the connection of a puru\u1e63a, or man. The puru\u1e63a impregnates, and the prak\u1e5bti delivers. We should not expect milk from the fleshy bags on the neck of a goat, although they look like breastly nipples. Similarly, we should not expect any creative power from the material ingredients; we must believe in the power of the puru\u1e63a, who impregnates prak\u1e5bti, or nature. Because the Lord wished to lie down in meditation, the material energy created innumerable universes at once, in each of them the Lord lay down, and thus all the planets and the different paraphernalia were created at once by the will of the Lord. The Lord has unlimited potencies, and thus He can act as He likes by perfect planning, although personally He has nothing to do. No one is greater than or equal to Him. That is the verdict of the Vedas."

To him a form means something of this material world, and therefore an opposite conception of the Absolute is necessary in the beginning to concentrate the mind on the power extension of the Lord. As stated above, the Lord extends His potency in the form of the mahat-tattva, which includes all material ingredients. The extension of power by the Lord and the Lord Himself personally are one in one sense, but at the same time the mahat-tattva is different from the Lord. Therefore the potency of the Lord and the Lord are simultaneously different and nondifferent. The conception of the vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa, especially for the impersonalist, is thus nondifferent from the eternal form of the Lord. This eternal form of the Lord exists prior to the creation of the mahat-tattva, and it is stressed here that the eternal form of the Lord is par excellence spiritual or transcendental to the modes of material nature. The very same transcendental form of the Lord is manifested by His internal potency, and the formation of His multifarious manifestations of incarnations is always of the same transcendental quality, without any touch of the mahat-tattva."

So we have to take information of the transcendental form of the Lord from persons who have actually seen Him with perfect eyes smeared with devotional service. In the material world also we do not always see things with our own eyes; we sometimes see through the experience of those who have actually seen or done things. If that is the process for experiencing a mundane object, it is more perfectly applicable in matters transcendental.

        "translation": "This form [the second manifestation of the puru\u1e63a] is the source and indestructible seed of multifarious incarnations within the universe. From the particles and portions of this form, different living entities, like demigods, men and others, are created.",
        "purport": " The puru\u1e63a, after creating innumerable universes in the mahat-tattva, entered in each of them as the second puru\u1e63a, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. When He saw that within the universe there was only darkness and space, without a resting place, He filled half of the universe with water from His own perspiration and laid Himself down on the same water. This water is called Garbhodaka. Then from His navel the stem of the lotus flower sprouted, and on the flower petals the birth of Brahm\u0101, or the master engineer of the universal plan, took place. Brahm\u0101 became the engineer of the universe, and the Lord Himself took charge of the maintenance of the universe as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Brahm\u0101 was generated from rajo-gu\u1e47a of prak\u1e5bti, or the mode of passion in nature, and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u became the Lord of the mode of goodness. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, being transcendental to all the modes, is always aloof from materialistic affection. This has already been explained. From Brahm\u0101 there is Rudra (\u015aiva), who is in charge of the mode of ignorance or darkness. He destroys the whole creation by the will of the Lord. Therefore all three, namely Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u015aiva, are incarnations of the Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. From Brahm\u0101 the other demigods like Dak\u1e63a, Mar\u012bci, Manu and many others become incarnated to generate living entities within the universe. This Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is glorified in the Vedas in the hymns of Garbha-stuti, which begin with the description of the Lord as having thousands of heads, etc. The Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Lord of the universe, and although He appears to be lying within the universe, He is always transcendental. This also has already been explained. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47u who is the plenary portion of the Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Supersoul of the universal life, and He is known as the maintainer of the universe or K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. So the three features of the original puru\u1e63a are thus understood. And all the incarnations within the universe are emanations from this K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In different millennia there are different incarnations, and they are innumerable, although some of them are very prominent, such as Matsya, K\u016brma, Var\u0101ha, R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, V\u0101mana and many others. These incarnations are called l\u012bl\u0101 incarnations. Then there are qualitative incarnations such as Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u015aiva (or Rudra) who take charge of the different modes of material nature. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead. Lord \u015aiva is in the marginal position between the Personality of Godhead and the living entities, or j\u012bvas. Brahm\u0101 is always a j\u012bva-tattva. The highest pious living being, or the greatest devotee of the Lord, is empowered with the potency of the Lord for creation, and he is called Brahm\u0101. His power is like the power of the sun reflected in valuable stones and jewels. When there is no such living being to take charge of the post of Brahm\u0101, the Lord Himself becomes a Brahm\u0101 and takes charge of the post. Lord \u015aiva is not an ordinary living being. He is the plenary portion of the Lord, but because Lord \u015aiva is in direct touch with material nature, he is not exactly in the same transcendental position as Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The difference is like that between milk and curd. Curd is nothing but milk, and yet it cannot be used in place of milk. The next incarnations are the Manus. Within one day\u2019s duration of the life of Brahm\u0101 (which is calculated by our solar year as 4,300,000 \u00d7 1,000 years) there are fourteen Manus. Therefore there are 420 Manus in one month of Brahm\u0101 and 5,040 Manus in one year of Brahm\u0101. Brahm\u0101 lives for one hundred years of his age, and therefore there are 5,040 \u00d7 100 or 504,000 Manus in the duration of Brahm\u0101\u2019s life. There are innumerable universes, with one Brahm\u0101 in each of them, and all of them are created and annihilated during the breathing time of the puru\u1e63a. Therefore one can simply imagine how many millions of Manus there are during one breath of the puru\u1e63a. The Manus who are prominent within this universe are as follows: Yaj\u00f1a as Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, Vibhu as Sv\u0101roci\u1e63a Manu, Satyasena as Uttama Manu, Hari as T\u0101masa Manu, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha as Raivata Manu, Ajita as C\u0101k\u1e63u\u1e63a Manu, V\u0101mana as Vaivasvata Manu (the present age is under the Vaivasvata Manu), S\u0101rvabhauma as S\u0101var\u1e47i Manu, \u1e5a\u1e63abha as Dak\u1e63a-s\u0101var\u1e47i Manu, Vi\u1e63vaksena as Brahma-s\u0101var\u1e47i Manu, Dharmasetu as Dharma-s\u0101var\u1e47i Manu, Sudh\u0101m\u0101 as Rudra-s\u0101var\u1e47i Manu, Yoge\u015bvara as Deva-s\u0101var\u1e47i Manu, and B\u1e5bhadbh\u0101nu as Indra-s\u0101var\u1e47i Manu. These are the names of one set of fourteen Manus covering 4,300,000,000 solar years as described above. Then there are the yug\u0101vat\u0101ras, or the incarnations of the millennia. The yugas are known as Satya-yuga, Tret\u0101-yuga, Dv\u0101para-yuga and Kali-yuga. The incarnations of each yuga are of different color. The colors are white, red, black and yellow. In the Dv\u0101para-yuga, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in black color appeared, and in the Kali-yuga Lord Caitanya in yellow color appeared. So all the incarnations of the Lord are mentioned in the revealed scriptures. There is no scope for an imposter to become an incarnation, for an incarnation must be mentioned in the \u015b\u0101stras. An incarnation does not declare Himself to be an incarnation of the Lord, but great sages agree by the symptoms mentioned in the revealed scriptures. The features of the incarnation and the particular type of mission which He has to execute are mentioned in the revealed scriptures. Apart from the direct incarnations, there are innumerable empowered incarnations. They are also mentioned in the revealed scriptures. Such incarnations are directly as well as indirectly empowered. When they are directly empowered they are called incarnations, but when they are indirectly empowered they are called vibh\u016btis. Directly empowered incarnations are the Kum\u0101ras, N\u0101rada, P\u1e5bthu, \u015ae\u1e63a, Ananta, etc. As far as vibh\u016btis are concerned, they are very explicitly described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the Vibh\u016bti-yoga chapter. And for all these different types of incarnations, the fountainhead is the Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u."

The Kum\u0101ras, as above mentioned, appeared in the Kaum\u0101ra creation of the material world, and to teach us the process of Brahman realization, they underwent a severe type of disciplinary action as bachelors. These Kum\u0101ras are empowered incarnations. And before executing the severe type of disciplinary actions, all of them became qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as. This example suggests that one must first acquire the qualifications of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, not simply by birth but also by quality, and then one can undergo the process of Brahman realization."

N\u0101rada is the author of N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, which is the exposition of the Vedas particularly for the devotional service of the Lord. This N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra trains the karm\u012bs, or the fruitive workers, to achieve liberation from the bondage of fruitive work. The conditioned souls are mostly attracted by fruitive work because they want to enjoy life by the sweat of their own brows. The whole universe is full of fruitive workers in all species of life. The fruitive works include all kinds of economic development plans. But the law of nature provides that every action has its resultant reaction, and the performer of the work is bound up by such reactions, good or bad. The reaction of good work is comparative material prosperity, whereas the reaction of bad work is comparative material distress. But material conditions, either in so-called happiness or in so-called distress, are all meant ultimately for distress only. Foolish materialists have no information of how to obtain eternal happiness in the unconditional state. \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada informs these foolish fruitive workers how to realize the reality of happiness. He gives direction to the diseased men of the world how one\u2019s present engagement can lead one to the path of spiritual emancipation. The physician directs the patient to take treated milk in the form of curd for his sufferings from indigestion due to his taking another milk preparation. So the cause of the disease and the remedy of the disease may be the same, but it must be treated by an expert physician like N\u0101rada. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also gives the same solution of serving the Lord by the fruits of one\u2019s labor. That will lead one to the path of nai\u1e63karmya, or liberation."

The intelligent class, the administrative class, the productive class and the laborer class are the four divisions of occupation. And the student life, the householder\u2019s life, retired life and renounced life are the four statuses of cultural advancement towards the path of spiritual realization. Out of these, the renounced order of life, or the order of sanny\u0101sa, is considered the highest of all, and a sanny\u0101s\u012b is constitutionally the spiritual master for all the orders and divisions. In the sanny\u0101sa order also there are four stages of upliftment toward perfection. These stages are called ku\u1e6d\u012bcaka, bah\u016bdaka, parivr\u0101jak\u0101c\u0101rya, and paramaha\u1e41sa. The paramaha\u1e41sa stage of life is the highest stage of perfection. This order of life is respected by all others. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u1e5a\u1e63abha, the son of King N\u0101bhi and Merudev\u012b, was an incarnation of the Lord, and He instructed His sons to follow the path of perfection by tapasya, which sanctifies one\u2019s existence and enables one to attain the stage of spiritual happiness which is eternal and ever increasing. Every living being is searching after happiness, but no one knows where eternal and unlimited happiness is obtainable. Foolish men seek after material sense pleasure as a substitute for real happiness, but such foolish men forget that temporary so-called happiness derived from sense pleasures is also enjoyed by the dogs and hogs. No animal, bird or beast is bereft of this sense pleasure. In every species of life, including the human form of life, such happiness is immensely obtainable. The human form of life, however, is not meant for such cheap happiness. The human life is meant for attaining eternal and unlimited happiness by spiritual realization. This spiritual realization is obtained by tapasya, or undergoing voluntarily the path of penance and abstinence from material pleasure. Those who have been trained for abstinence in material pleasures are called dh\u012bra, or men undisturbed by the senses. Only these dh\u012bras can accept the orders of sanny\u0101sa, and they can gradually rise to the status of the paramaha\u1e41sa, which is adored by all members of society. King \u1e5a\u1e63abha propagated this mission, and at the last stage He became completely aloof from the material bodily needs, which is a rare stage not to be imitated by foolish men, but to be worshiped by all."

But the present Age of Kali is full of ignorant men. Even those who are born by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a father are, in the present age, no better than the \u015b\u016bdras or the women. The twice-born men, namely the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas, are expected to undergo a cultural purificatory process known as sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras, but because of the bad influence of the present age the so-called members of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a and other high-order families are no longer highly cultured. They are called the dvija-bandhus, or the friends and family members of the twice-born. But these dvija-bandhus are classified amongst the \u015b\u016bdras and the women. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva divided the Vedas into various branches and subbranches for the sake of the less intelligent classes like the dvija-bandhus, \u015b\u016bdras and women."

Sometimes great demons and atheists like R\u0101va\u1e47a and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and many others become very famous due to advancing material civilization by the help of material science and other activities with a spirit of challenging the established order of the Lord. For example, the attempt to fly to other planets by material means is a challenge to the established order. The conditions of each and every planet are different, and different classes of human beings are accommodated there for particular purposes mentioned in the codes of the Lord. But, puffed up by tiny success in material advancement, sometimes the godless materialists challenge the existence of God. R\u0101va\u1e47a was one of them, and he wanted to deport ordinary men to the planet of Indra (heaven) by material means without consideration of the necessary qualifications. He wanted a staircase to be built up directly reaching the heavenly planet so that people might not be required to undergo the routine of pious work necessary to enter that planet. He also wanted to perform other acts against the established rule of the Lord. He even challenged the authority of \u015ar\u012b R\u0101ma, the Personality of Godhead, and kidnapped His wife, S\u012bt\u0101. Of course, Lord R\u0101ma came to chastise this atheist, answering the prayer and desire of the demigods. He therefore took up the challenge of R\u0101va\u1e47a, and the complete activity is the subject matter of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. Because Lord R\u0101macandra was the Personality of Godhead, He exhibited superhuman activities which no human being, including the materially advanced R\u0101va\u1e47a, could perform. Lord R\u0101macandra prepared a royal road on the Indian Ocean with stones that floated on the water. The modern scientists have done research in the area of weightlessness, but it is not possible to bring in weightlessness anywhere and everywhere. But because weightlessness is the creation of the Lord by which He can make the gigantic planets fly and float in the air, He made the stones even within this earth to be weightless and prepared a stone bridge on the sea without any supporting pillar. That is the display of the power of God."

        "translation": "Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of A\u00f1jan\u0101, in the province of Gay\u0101, just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist.",
        "purport": " Lord Buddha, a powerful incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, appeared in the province of Gay\u0101 (Bihar) as the son of A\u00f1jan\u0101, and he preached his own conception of nonviolence and deprecated even the animal sacrifices sanctioned in the Vedas. At the time when Lord Buddha appeared, the people in general were atheistic and preferred animal flesh to anything else. On the plea of Vedic sacrifice, every place was practically turned into a slaughterhouse, and animal-killing was indulged in unrestrictedly. Lord Buddha preached nonviolence, taking pity on the poor animals. He preached that he did not believe in the tenets of the Vedas and stressed the adverse psychological effects incurred by animal-killing. Less intelligent men of the Age of Kali, who had no faith in God, followed his principle, and for the time being they were trained in moral discipline and nonviolence, the preliminary steps for proceeding further on the path of God realization. He deluded the atheists because such atheists who followed his principles did not believe in God, but they kept their absolute faith in Lord Buddha, who himself was the incarnation of God. Thus the faithless people were made to believe in God in the form of Lord Buddha. That was the mercy of Lord Buddha: he made the faithless faithful to him. Killing of animals before the advent of Lord Buddha was the most prominent feature of the society. People claimed that these were Vedic sacrifices. When the Vedas are not accepted through the authoritative disciplic succession, the casual readers of the Vedas are misled by the flowery language of that system of knowledge. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 a comment has been made on such foolish scholars (avipa\u015bcita\u1e25). The foolish scholars of Vedic literature who do not care to receive the transcendental message through the transcendental realized sources of disciplic succession are sure to be bewildered. To them, the ritualistic ceremonies are considered to be all in all. They have no depth of knowledge. According to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: the whole system of the Vedas is to lead one gradually to the path of the Supreme Lord. The whole theme of Vedic literature is to know the Supreme Lord, the individual soul, the cosmic situation and the relation between all these items. When the relation is known, the relative function begins, and as a result of such a function the ultimate goal of life or going back to Godhead takes place in the easiest manner. Unfortunately, unauthorized scholars of the Vedas become captivated by the purificatory ceremonies only, and natural progress is thereby checked. To such bewildered persons of atheistic propensity, Lord Buddha is the emblem of theism. He therefore first of all wanted to check the habit of animal-killing. The animal-killers are dangerous elements on the path going back to Godhead. There are two types of animal-killers. The soul is also sometimes called the \u201canimal\u201d or the living being. Therefore, both the slaughterer of animals and those who have lost their identity of soul are animal-killers. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it said that only the animal-killer cannot relish the transcendental message of the Supreme Lord. Therefore if people are to be educated to the path of Godhead, they must be taught first and foremost to stop the process of animal-killing as above mentioned. It is nonsensical to say that animal-killing has nothing to do with spiritual realization. By this dangerous theory many so-called sanny\u0101s\u012bs have sprung up by the grace of Kali-yuga who preach animal-killing under the garb of the Vedas. The subject matter has already been discussed in the conversation between Lord Caitanya and Maulana Chand Kazi Shaheb. The animal sacrifice as stated in the Vedas is different from the unrestricted animal-killing in the slaughterhouse. Because the asuras or the so-called scholars of Vedic literatures put forward the evidence of animal-killing in the Vedas, Lord Buddha superficially denied the authority of the Vedas. This rejection of the Vedas by Lord Buddha was adopted in order to save people from the vice of animal-killing as well as to save the poor animals from the slaughtering process of their big brothers who clamor for universal brotherhood, peace, justice and equity. There is no justice when there is animal-killing. Lord Buddha wanted to stop it completely, and therefore his cult of ahi\u1e41s\u0101 was propagated not only in India but also outside the country. Technically Lord Buddha\u2019s philosophy is called atheistic because there is no acceptance of the Supreme Lord and because that system of philosophy denied the authority of the Vedas. But that is an act of camouflage by the Lord. Lord Buddha is the incarnation of Godhead. As such, he is the original propounder of Vedic knowledge. He therefore cannot reject Vedic philosophy. But he rejected it outwardly because the sura-dvi\u1e63a, or the demons who are always envious of the devotees of Godhead, try to support cow-killing or animal-killing from the pages of the Vedas, and this is now being done by the modernized sanny\u0101s\u012bs. Lord Buddha had to reject the authority of the Vedas altogether. This is simply technical, and had it not been so he would not have been so accepted as the incarnation of Godhead. Nor would he have been worshiped in the transcendental songs of the poet Jayadeva, who is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101rya. Lord Buddha preached the preliminary principles of the Vedas in a manner suitable for the time, (and so also did \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya) to establish the authority of the Vedas. Therefore both Lord Buddha and \u0100c\u0101rya \u015aa\u1e45kara paved the path of theism, and Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas, specifically Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, led the people on the path towards a realization of going back to Godhead. We are glad that people are taking interest in the nonviolent movement of Lord Buddha. But will they take the matter very seriously and close the animal slaughterhouses altogether? If not, there is no meaning to the ahi\u1e41s\u0101 cult. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was composed just prior to the beginning of the Age of Kali (about five thousand years ago), and Lord Buddha appeared about twenty-six hundred years ago. Therefore in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam Lord Buddha is foretold. Such is the authority of this clear scripture. There are many such prophecies, and they are being fulfilled one after another. They will indicate the positive standing of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which is without any trace of mistake, illusion, cheating and imperfection, which are the four flaws of all conditioned souls. The liberated souls are above these flaws; therefore they can see and foretell things which are to take place on distant future dates."

        "purport": " The list of incarnations of the Personality of Godhead given herein is not complete. It is only a partial view of all the incarnations. There are many others, such as \u015ar\u012b Hayagr\u012bva, Hari, Ha\u1e41sa, P\u1e5b\u015bnigarbha, Vibhu, Satyasena, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, S\u0101rvabhauma, Vi\u1e63vaksena, Dharmasetu, Sudh\u0101m\u0101, Yoge\u015bvara, B\u1e5bhadbh\u0101nu and others of the bygone ages. \u015ar\u012b Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said in his prayer, \u201cMy Lord, You manifest as many incarnations as there are species of life, namely the aquatics, the vegetables, the reptiles, the birds, the beasts, the men, the demigods, etc., just for the maintenance of the faithful and the annihilation of the unfaithful. You advent Yourself in this way in accordance with the necessity of the different yugas. In the Kali-yuga You have incarnated garbed as a devotee.\u201d This incarnation of the Lord in the Kali-yuga is Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. There are many other places, both in the Bh\u0101gavatam and in other scriptures, in which the incarnation of the Lord as \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is explicitly mentioned. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 also it is said indirectly that although there are many incarnations of the Lord, such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha, Matsya, K\u016brma and many others, the Lord Himself sometimes incarnates in person. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu are not, therefore, incarnations, but the original source of all other incarnations. This will be clearly explained in the next \u015bloka. So the Lord is the inexhaustible source for innumerable incarnations which are not always mentioned. But such incarnations are distinguished by specific extraordinary feats which are impossible to be performed by any living being. That is the general test to identify an incarnation of the Lord, directly and indirectly empowered. Some incarnations mentioned above are almost plenary portions. For instance, the Kum\u0101ras are empowered with transcendental knowledge. \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada is empowered with devotional service. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu is an empowered incarnation with executive function. The Matsya incarnation is directly a plenary portion. So the innumerable incarnations of the Lord are manifested all over the universes constantly, without cessation, as water flows constantly from waterfalls."

All of them appear on planets whenever there is a disturbance created by the atheists. The Lord incarnates to protect the theists.",
        "purport": " In this particular stanza Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, is distinguished from other incarnations. He is counted amongst the avat\u0101ras (incarnations) because out of His causeless mercy the Lord descends from His transcendental abode. Avat\u0101ra means \u201cone who descends.\u201d All the incarnations of the Lord, including the Lord Himself, descend to the different planets of the material world as also in different species of life to fulfill particular missions. Sometimes He comes Himself, and sometimes His different plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions, or His differentiated portions directly or indirectly empowered by Him, descend to this material world to execute certain specific functions. Originally the Lord is full of all opulences, all prowess, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation. When they are partly manifested through the plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions, it should be noted that certain manifestations of His different powers are required for those particular functions. When in the room small electric bulbs are displayed, it does not mean that the electric powerhouse is limited by the small bulbs. The same powerhouse can supply power to operate large-scale industrial dynamos with greater volts. Similarly, the incarnations of the Lord display limited powers because so much power is needed at that particular time. For example, Lord Para\u015bur\u0101ma and Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha displayed unusual opulence by killing the disobedient k\u1e63atriyas twenty-one times and killing the greatly powerful atheist Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was so powerful that even the demigods in other planets would tremble simply by the unfavorable raising of his eyebrow. The demigods in the higher level of material existence many, many times excel the most well-to-do human beings in duration of life, beauty, wealth, paraphernalia and all other respects. Still they were afraid of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. Thus we can simply imagine how powerful Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was in this material world. But even Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was cut into small pieces by the nails of Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha. This means that anyone materially powerful cannot stand the strength of the Lord\u2019s nails. Similarly, J\u0101madagnya displayed the Lord\u2019s power to kill all the disobedient kings powerfully situated in their respective states. The Lord\u2019s empowered incarnation N\u0101rada and plenary incarnation Var\u0101ha, as well as indirectly empowered Lord Buddha, created faith in the mass of people. The incarnations of R\u0101ma and Dhanvantari displayed His fame, and Balar\u0101ma, Mohin\u012b and V\u0101mana exhibited His beauty. Datt\u0101treya, Matsya, Kum\u0101ra and Kapila exhibited His transcendental knowledge. Nara and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u1e5a\u1e63is exhibited His renunciation. So all the different indirectly or directly empowered incarnations of the Lord manifested different features, but Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the primeval Lord, exhibited the complete features of Godhead, and thus it is confirmed that He is the source of all other incarnations. And the most extraordinary feature exhibited by Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was His internal energetic manifestation of His pastimes with the cowherd girls. His pastimes with the gop\u012bs are all displays of transcendental existence, bliss and knowledge, although these are manifested apparently as sex love. The specific attraction of His pastimes with the gop\u012bs should never be misunderstood. The Bh\u0101gavatam relates these transcendental pastimes in the Tenth Canto. And in order to reach the position to understand the transcendental nature of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes with the gop\u012bs, the Bh\u0101gavatam promotes the student gradually in nine other cantos. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s statement, in accordance with authoritative sources, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of all other incarnations. It is not that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has any source of incarnation. All the symptoms of the Supreme Truth in full are present in the person of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord emphatically declares that there is no truth greater than or equal to Himself. In this stanza the word svayam is particularly mentioned to confirm that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no other source than Himself. Although in other places the incarnations are described as bhagav\u0101n because of their specific functions, nowhere are they declared to be the Supreme Personality. In this stanza the word svayam signifies the supremacy as the summum bonum. The summum bonum K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is one without a second. He Himself has expanded Himself in various parts, portions and particles as svaya\u1e41-r\u016bpa, svayam-prak\u0101\u015ba, tad-ek\u0101tm\u0101, pr\u0101bhava, vaibhava, vil\u0101sa, avat\u0101ra, \u0101ve\u015ba, and j\u012bvas, all provided with innumerable energies just suitable to the respective persons and personalities. Learned scholars in transcendental subjects have carefully analyzed the summum bonum K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to have sixty-four principal attributes. All the expansions or categories of the Lord possess only some percentages of these attributes. But \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the possessor of the attributes cent percent. And His personal expansions such as svayam-prak\u0101\u015ba and tad-ek\u0101tm\u0101, up to the categories of the avat\u0101ras who are all vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, possess up to ninety-three percent of these transcendental attributes. Lord \u015aiva, who is neither avat\u0101ra nor \u0101ve\u015ba nor in between them, possesses almost eighty-four percent of the attributes. But the j\u012bvas, or the individual living beings in different statuses of life, possess up to the limit of seventy-eight percent of the attributes. In the conditioned state of material existence, the living being possesses these attributes in very minute quantity, varying in terms of the pious life of the living being. The most perfect of living beings is Brahm\u0101, the supreme administrator of one universe. He possesses seventy-eight percent of the attributes in full. All other demigods have the same attributes in less quantity, whereas human beings possess the attributes in very minute quantity. The standard of perfection for a human being is to develop the attributes up to seventy-eight percent in full. The living being can never possess attributes like \u015aiva, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A living being can become godly by developing the seventy-eight-percent transcendental attributes in fullness, but he can never become a God like \u015aiva, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He can become a Brahm\u0101 in due course. The godly living beings who are all residents of the planets in the spiritual sky are eternal associates of God in different spiritual planets called Hari-dh\u0101ma and Mahe\u015ba-dh\u0101ma. The abode of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a above all spiritual planets is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka or Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and the perfected living being, by developing seventy-eight percent of the above attributes in fullness, can enter the planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka after leaving the present material body."

So simply knowing factually the mysterious way of the Lord\u2019s incarnation in this material world can liberate one from material bondage. Therefore the birth and activities of the Lord, as manifested by Him for the welfare of the people in general, are not ordinary.

It is advised therefore that one who simply recites this chapter of Bh\u0101gavatam, describing the appearance of the Lord in different incarnations, in sincerity and devotion, can have insight into the birth and activities of the Lord. The very word vimukti, or liberation, indicates that the Lord\u2019s birth and activities are all transcendental; otherwise simply by reciting them one could not attain liberation. They are therefore mysterious, and those who do not follow the prescribed regulations of devotional service are not entitled to enter into the mysteries of His births and activities."

In the vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa the material manifestations of different planets have been conceived as His legs, hands, etc. Actually all such descriptions are for the neophytes. The neophytes cannot conceive of anything beyond matter. The material conception of the Lord is not counted in the list of His factual forms. As Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul, the Lord is within each and every material form, even within the atoms, but the outward material form is but an imagination, both for the Lord and for the living being. The present forms of the conditioned souls are also not factual. The conclusion is that the material conception of the body of the Lord as vir\u0101\u1e6d is imaginary. Both the Lord and the living beings are living spirits and have original spiritual bodies."

The coverings take place due to ignorance. Such coverings are never effective in the person of the Personality of Godhead. Knowing this convincingly is called liberation, or seeing the Absolute. This means that perfect self-realization is made possible by adoption of godly or spiritual life. Self-realization means becoming indifferent to the needs of the gross and subtle bodies and becoming serious about the activities of the self. The impetus for activities is generated from the self, but such activities become illusory due to ignorance of the real position of the self. By ignorance, self-interest is calculated in terms of the gross and subtle bodies, and therefore a whole set of activities is spoiled, life after life. When, however, one meets the self by proper culture, the activities of the self begin. Therefore a man who is engaged in the activities of the self is called j\u012bvan-mukta, or a liberated person even in the conditional existence. This perfect stage of self-realization is attained not by artificial means, but under the lotus feet of the Lord, who is always transcendental. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that He is present in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Him only all knowledge, remembrance or forgetfulness take place. When the living being desires to be an enjoyer of material energy (illusory phenomena), the Lord covers the living being in the mystery of forgetfulness, and thus the living being misinterprets the gross body and subtle mind to be his own self. And by culture of transcendental knowledge, when the living being prays to the Lord for deliverance from the clutches of forgetfulness, the Lord, by His causeless mercy, removes the living being\u2019s illusory curtain, and thus he realizes his own self. He then engages himself in the service of the Lord in his eternal constitutional position, becoming liberated from the conditioned life. All this is executed by the Lord either through His external potency or directly by the internal potency."

And the very same energy then acts to help the purified living being make progress on the path of self-realization. The example of electrical energy is very appropriate in this connection. The expert electrician can utilize the electrical energy for both heating and cooling by adjustment only. Similarly, the external energy, which now bewilders the living being into continuation of birth and death, is turned into internal potency by the will of the Lord to lead the living being to eternal life.

It is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the Lord that His so-called birth in the material world and His activities are all transcendental. And simply by meditation on such activities one can attain realization of Brahman and thus become liberated from material bondage. In the \u015brutis it is said that the birthless appears to take birth. The Supreme has nothing to do, but because He is omnipotent, everything is performed by Him naturally, as if done automatically. As a matter of fact, the appearance and disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His different activities are all confidential, even to the Vedic literatures. Yet they are displayed by the Lord to bestow mercy upon the conditioned souls.

He is transcendental to all material afflictions because He is full with all six opulences, namely wealth, power, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, and thus He is the master of the senses. He creates these manifested universes in order to reclaim the living beings who are within them suffering threefold miseries, maintains them, and in due course annihilates them without being the least affected by such actions. He is connected with this material creation very superficially, as one smells odor without being connected with the odorous article. Nongodly elements, therefore, can never approach Him, despite all endeavors."

And yet there are some men, with a poor fund of knowledge, who desire to understand the Absolute Truth by imperfect mental speculation and faulty description of His activities. To the layman His activities, appearance and disappearance, His names, His forms, His paraphernalia, His personalities and all things in relation with Him are mysterious. There are two classes of materialists, namely the fruitive workers and the empiric philosophers. The fruitive workers have practically no information of the Absolute Truth, and the mental speculators, after being frustrated in fruitive activities, turn their faces towards the Absolute Truth and try to know Him by mental speculation. And for all these men, the Absolute Truth is a mystery, as the jugglery of the magician is a mystery to children. Being deceived by the jugglery of the Supreme Being, the nondevotees, who may be very dexterous in fruitive work and mental speculation, are always in ignorance. With such limited knowledge, they are unable to penetrate into the mysterious region of transcendence. The mental speculators are a little more progressive than the gross materialists or the fruitive workers, but because they are also within the grip of illusion, they take it for granted that anything which has form, a name and activities is but a product of material energy. For them the Supreme Spirit is formless, nameless and inactive. And because such mental speculators equalize the transcendental name and form of the Lord with mundane names and form, they are in fact in ignorance. With such a poor fund of knowledge, there is no access to the real nature of the Supreme Being. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord is always in a transcendental position, even when He is within the material world. But ignorant men consider the Lord one of the great personalities of the world, and thus they are misled by the illusory energy."

Such favorable servitors are devotees of the Lord, and by the grace of the Lord they can enter into the mysterious region of transcendence by the mercy of the Lord.

Lord Caitanya\u2019s private secretary \u015ar\u012bla Svar\u016bpa D\u0101modara Gosv\u0101m\u012b advised all intending visitors who came to see the Lord at Pur\u012b to make a study of the Bh\u0101gavatam from the person Bh\u0101gavatam. Person Bh\u0101gavatam is the self-realized bona fide spiritual master, and through him only can one understand the lessons of Bh\u0101gavatam in order to receive the desired result. One can derive from the study of the Bh\u0101gavatam all benefits that are possible to be derived from the personal presence of the Lord. It carries with it all the transcendental blessings of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that we can expect from His personal contact."

        "purport": " Men with a poor fund of knowledge only accept the history of the world from the time of Buddha, or since 600 B.C., and prior to this period all histories mentioned in the scriptures are calculated by them to be only imaginary stories. That is not a fact. All the stories mentioned in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, etc., are actual histories, not only of this planet but also of millions of other planets within the universe. Sometimes the history of planets beyond this world appears to such men to be unbelievable. But they do not know that different planets are not equal in all respects and that therefore some of the historical facts derived from other planets do not correspond with the experience of this planet. Considering the different situation of different planets and also time and circumstances, there is nothing wonderful in the stories of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, nor are they imaginary. We should always remember the maxim that one man\u2019s food is another man\u2019s poison. We should not, therefore, reject the stories and histories of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as as imaginary. The great \u1e5b\u1e63is like Vy\u0101sa had no business putting some imaginary stories in their literatures. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam historical facts selected from the histories of different planets have been depicted. It is therefore accepted by all the spiritual authorities as the Mah\u0101-pur\u0101\u1e47a. The special significance of these histories is that they are all connected with activities of the Lord in a different time and atmosphere. \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b is the topmost personality of all the self-realized souls, and he accepted this as the subject of studies from his father, Vy\u0101sadeva. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva is the great authority, and the subject matter of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam being so important, he delivered the message first to his great son \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. It is compared to the cream of the milk. Vedic literature is like the Milk Ocean of knowledge. Cream or butter is the most palatable essence of milk, and so also is \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, for it contains all palatable, instructive and authentic versions of different activities of the Lord and His devotees. There is no gain, however, in accepting the message of Bh\u0101gavatam from the unbelievers, atheists and professional reciters who make a trade of Bh\u0101gavatam for the laymen. It was delivered to \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, and he had nothing to do with the Bh\u0101gavata business. He did not have to maintain family expenses by such trade. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam should therefore be received from the representative of \u015aukadeva, who must be in the renounced order of life without family encumbrance. Milk is undoubtedly very good and nourishing, but when it is touched by the mouth of a snake it is no longer nourishing; rather, it becomes a source of death. Similarly, those who are not strictly in the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava discipline should not make a business of this Bh\u0101gavatam and become a cause of spiritual death for so many hearers. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that the purpose of all the Vedas is to know Him (Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in the form of recorded knowledge. Therefore, it is the cream of all the Vedas, and it contains all historical facts of all times in relation with \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is factually the essence of all histories."

        "purport": " All transcendental messages are received properly in the chain of disciplic succession. This disciplic succession is called parampar\u0101. Unless therefore Bh\u0101gavatam or any other Vedic literatures are received through the parampar\u0101 system, the reception of knowledge is not bona fide. Vy\u0101sadeva delivered the message to \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, and from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b received the message. One should therefore receive the message of Bh\u0101gavatam from S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b or from his representative and not from any irrelevant interpreter. Emperor Par\u012bk\u1e63it received the information of his death in time, and he at once left his kingdom and family and sat down on the bank of the Ganges to fast till death. All great sages, \u1e5b\u1e63is, philosophers, mystics, etc., went there due to his imperial position. They offered many suggestions about his immediate duty, and at last it was settled that he would hear from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b about Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the Bh\u0101gavatam was spoken to him. \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, who preached M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy and stressed the impersonal feature of the Absolute, also recommended that one must take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for there is no hope of gain from debating. Indirectly \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya admitted that what he had preached in the flowery grammatical interpretations of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra cannot help one at the time of death. At the critical hour of death one must recite the name of Govinda. This is the recommendation of all great transcendentalists. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b had long ago stated the same truth, that at the end one must remember N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. That is the essence of all spiritual activities. In pursuance of this eternal truth, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was heard by Emperor Par\u012bk\u1e63it, and it was recited by the able \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. And both the speaker and the receiver of the messages of Bh\u0101gavatam were duly delivered by the same medium."

        "purport": " Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has His eternal dh\u0101ma, or abode, where He eternally enjoys Himself with His eternal associates and paraphernalia. And His eternal abode is a manifestation of His internal energy, whereas the material world is a manifestation of His external energy. When He descends to the material world, He displays Himself with all paraphernalia in His internal potency, which is called \u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that He descends by His own potency (\u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101). His form, name, fame, paraphernalia, abode, etc., are not, therefore, creations of matter. He descends to reclaim the fallen souls and to reestablish codes of religion which are directly enacted by Him. Except for God, no one can establish the principles of religion. Either He or a suitable person empowered by Him can dictate the codes of religion. Real religion means to know God, our relation with Him and our duties in relation with Him and to know ultimately our destination after leaving this material body. The conditioned souls, who are entrapped by the material energy, hardly know all these principles of life. Most of them are like animals engaged in eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. They are mostly engaged in sense enjoyment under the pretension of religiosity, knowledge or salvation. They are still more blind in the present age of quarrel, or Kali-yuga. In the Kali-yuga the population is just a royal edition of the animals. They have nothing to do with spiritual knowledge or godly religious life. They are so blind that they cannot see anything beyond the jurisdiction of the subtle mind, intelligence or ego, but they are very much proud of their advancement in knowledge, science and material prosperity. They can risk their lives to become a dog or hog just after leaving the present body, for they have completely lost sight of the ultimate aim of life. The Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appeared before us just a little prior to the beginning of Kali-yuga, and He returned to His eternal home practically at the commencement of Kali-yuga. While He was present, He exhibited everything by His different activities. He spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 specifically and eradicated all pretentious principles of religiosity. And prior to His departure from this material world, He empowered \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva through N\u0101rada to compile the messages of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and thus both the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam are like torchbearers for the blind people of this age. In other words, if men in this Age of Kali want to see the real light of life, they must take to these two books only, and their aim of life will be fulfilled. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the preliminary study of the Bh\u0101gavatam. And \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the summum bonum of life, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personified. We must therefore accept \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as the direct representation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who can see \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam can see also Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in person. They are identical."

        "translation": "O learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as, when \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b recited Bh\u0101gavatam there [in the presence of Emperor Par\u012bk\u1e63it], I heard him with rapt attention, and thus, by his mercy, I learned the Bh\u0101gavatam from that great and powerful sage. Now I shall try to make you hear the very same thing as I learned it from him and as I have realized it.",
        "purport": " One can certainly see directly the presence of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the pages of Bh\u0101gavatam if one has heard it from a self-realized great soul like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. One cannot, however, learn Bh\u0101gavatam from a bogus hired reciter whose aim of life is to earn some money out of such recitation and employ the earning in sex indulgence. No one can learn \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam who is associated with persons engaged in sex life. That is the secret of learning Bh\u0101gavatam. Nor can one learn Bh\u0101gavatam from one who interprets the text by his mundane scholarship. One has to learn Bh\u0101gavatam from the representative of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, and no one else, if one at all wants to see Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the pages. That is the process, and there is no alternative. S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b is a bona fide representative of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b because he wants to present the message which he received from the great learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b presented Bh\u0101gavatam as he heard it from his great father, and so also S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b is presenting Bh\u0101gavatam as he had heard it from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. Simple hearing is not all; one must realize the text with proper attention. The word nivi\u1e63\u1e6da means that S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b drank the juice of Bh\u0101gavatam through his ears. That is the real process of receiving Bh\u0101gavatam. One should hear with rapt attention from the real person, and then he can at once realize the presence of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in every page. The secret of knowing Bh\u0101gavatam is mentioned here. No one can give rapt attention who is not pure in mind. No one can be pure in mind who is not pure in action. No one can be pure in action who is not pure in eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. But somehow or other if someone hears with rapt attention from the right person, at the very beginning one can assuredly see Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in person in the pages of Bh\u0101gavatam."
