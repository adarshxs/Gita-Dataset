Such associates of the Lord are eternally liberated souls, and they cannot bear the separation of the Lord even for a moment because of intense affection for the Lord. Thus the inhabitants of the city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 were in a mood of dejection and expected the arrival of the Lord at any moment. So the heralding sound of the auspicious conchshell was very encouraging, and apparently the sound pacified their dejection. They were still more aspirant to see the Lord amongst themselves, and all of them became alert to receive Him in the befitting manner. These are the signs of spontaneous love of Godhead."

        "translation": "The citizens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, having heard that sound which threatens fear personified in the material world, began to run towards Him fast, just to have a long desired audience with the Lord, who is the protector of all devotees.",
        "purport": " As already explained, the citizens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 who lived at the time of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s presence there were all liberated souls who descended there along with the Lord as entourage. All were very anxious to have an audience with the Lord, although because of spiritual contact they were never separated from the Lord. Just as the gop\u012bs at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana used to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a while He was away from the village for cowherding engagements, the citizens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 were all immersed in thought of the Lord while He was away from Dv\u0101rak\u0101 to attend the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Some distinguished fiction writer in Bengal concluded that the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, that of Mathur\u0101 and that of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 were different personalities. Historically there is no truth in this conclusion. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a of Kuruk\u1e63etra and the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 are one and the same personality. The citizens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 were thus in a state of melancholy due to the Lord\u2019s absence from the transcendental city, as much as we are put in a state of melancholy at night because of the absence of the sun. The sound heralded by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was something like the heralding of the sunrise in the morning. So all the citizens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 awoke from a state of slumber because of the sunrise of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they all hastened towards Him just to have an audience. The devotees of the Lord know no one else as protector. This sound of the Lord is identical with the Lord, as we have tried to explain by the nondual position of the Lord. The material existence of our present status is full of fear. Out of the four problems of material existence, namely the food problem, the shelter problem, the fear problem and the mating problem, the fear problem gives us more trouble than the others. We are always fearful due to our ignorance of the next problem. The whole material existence is full of problems, and thus the fear problem is always prominent. This is due to our association with the illusory energy of the Lord, known as m\u0101y\u0101 or external energy, yet all fear is vanished as soon as there is the sound of the Lord, represented by His holy name, as it was sounded by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu in the following sixteen words: We can take advantage of these sounds and be free from all threatening problems of material existence."

        "purport": " The Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described herein as \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma. He is self-sufficient, and there is no need for Him to seek happiness from anything beyond Himself. He is self-sufficient because His very transcendental existence is total bliss. He is eternally existent; He is all-cognizant and all-blissful. Therefore, any presentation, however valuable it may be, is not needed by Him. But still, because He is the well-wisher for one and all, He accepts from everyone everything that is offered to Him in pure devotional service. It is not that He is in want for such things, because the things are themselves generated from His energy. The comparison is made herein that making offerings to the Lord is something like offering a lamp in the worship of the sun-god. Anything fiery and illuminating is but an emanation of the energy of the sun, and yet to worship the sun-god it is necessary to offer him a lamp. In the worship of the sun, there is some sort of demand made by the worshiper, but in the case of devotional service to the Lord, there is no question of demand from either side. It is all a sign of pure love and affection between the Lord and the devotee. The Lord is the supreme father of all living beings, and therefore those who are conscious of this vital relation with God can make filial demands from the father, and the father is pleased to supply the demands of such obedient sons without bargaining. The Lord is just like the desire tree, and from Him everyone can have everything by the causeless mercy of the Lord. As the supreme father, the Lord, however, does not supply to a pure devotee what is considered to be a barrier to the discharge of devotional service. Those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord can rise to the position of unalloyed devotional service by His transcendental attraction."

No one is equal to or greater than Him, and that is the verdict of all scriptures. The influence of time and space is exerted upon the dependent living entities, who are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. The living entities are predominated brahma, whereas the Supreme Lord is the predominating Absolute. As soon as we forget this clear fact, we are at once in illusion, and thus we are put into threefold miseries, as one is put into dense darkness. The clear consciousness of the cognizant living being is God consciousness, in which one bows down unto Him in all circumstances."

This is the original state of the living entities and can be attained by reviving our natural and constitutional state of life, which is discovered by devotional service only."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s attraction is so powerful that once being attracted by Him one cannot tolerate separation from Him. Why is this so? Because we are all eternally related with Him as the sun rays are eternally related with the sun disc. The sun rays are molecular parts of the solar radiation. Thus the sun rays and the sun cannot be separated. The separation by the cloud is temporary and artificial, and as soon as the cloud is cleared, the sun rays again display their natural effulgence in the presence of the sun. Similarly, the living entities, who are molecular parts of the whole spirit, are separated from the Lord by the artificial covering of m\u0101y\u0101, illusory energy. This illusory energy, or the curtain of m\u0101y\u0101, has to be removed, and when it is so done, the living entity can see the Lord face to face, and all his miseries are at once removed. Every one of us wants to remove the miseries of life, but we do not know how to do it. The solution is given here, and it rests on us to assimilate it or not."

As we find herewith in the description of its opulence, Dv\u0101rak\u0101 was surrounded by flower gardens and fruit orchards along with reservoirs of water and growing lotuses. There is no mention of mills and factories supported by slaughterhouses, which are the necessary paraphernalia of the modern metropolis. The propensity to utilize nature\u2019s own gifts is still there, even in the heart of modern civilized man. The leaders of modern civilization select their own residential quarters in a place where there are such naturally beautiful gardens and reservoirs of water, but they leave the common men to reside in congested areas without parks and gardens. Herein of course we find a different description of the city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. It is understood that the whole dh\u0101ma, or residential quarter, was surrounded by such gardens and parks with reservoirs of water where lotuses grew. It is understood that all the people depended on nature\u2019s gifts of fruits and flowers without industrial enterprises promoting filthy huts and slums for residential quarters. Advancement of civilization is estimated not on the growth of mills and factories to deteriorate the finer instincts of the human being, but on developing the potent spiritual instincts of human beings and giving them a chance to go back to Godhead. Development of factories and mills is called ugra-karma, or pungent activities, and such activities deteriorate the finer sentiments of the human being and society to form a dungeon of demons. We find herein the mention of pious trees which produce seasonal flowers and fruits. The impious trees are useless jungles only, and they can only be used to supply fuels. In the modern civilization such impious trees are planted on the sides of roads. Human energy should be properly utilized in developing the finer senses for spiritual understanding, in which lies the solution of life. Fruits, flowers, beautiful gardens, parks and reservoirs of water with ducks and swans playing in the midst of lotus flowers, and cows giving sufficient milk and butter are essential for developing the finer tissues of the human body. As against this, the dungeons of mines, factories and workshops develop demoniac propensities in the working class. The vested interests flourish at the cost of the working class, and consequently there are severe clashes between them in so many ways. The description of Dv\u0101rak\u0101-dh\u0101ma is the ideal of human civilization."

        "purport": " Vasudeva: Son of King \u015a\u016brasena, husband of Devak\u012b and father of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the brother of Kunt\u012b and father of Subhadr\u0101. Subhadr\u0101 was married with her cousin Arjuna, and this system is still prevalent in some parts of India. Vasudeva was appointed minister of Ugrasena, and later on he married eight daughters of Ugrasena\u2019s brother Devaka. Devak\u012b is only one of them. Ka\u1e41sa was his brother-in-law, and Vasudeva accepted voluntary imprisonment by Ka\u1e41sa on mutual agreement to deliver the eighth son of Devak\u012b. This was foiled by the will of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As maternal uncle of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, he took active parts in the purificatory process of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. He sent for the priest Ka\u015byapa at \u015aata\u015b\u1e5b\u1e45ga Parvata, and he executed the functions. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared within the bars of Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s prison house, He was transferred by Vasudeva to the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the foster father of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, at Gokula. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a disappeared along with Baladeva prior to the disappearance of Vasudeva, and Arjuna (Vasudeva\u2019s nephew) undertook the charge of the funeral ceremony after Vasudeva\u2019s disappearance. Akr\u016bra: The commander in chief of the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i dynasty and a great devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Akr\u016bra attained success in devotional service to the Lord by the one single process of offering prayers. He was the husband of S\u016btan\u012b, daughter of Ah\u016bka. He supported Arjuna when Arjuna took Subhadr\u0101 forcibly away by the will of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Akr\u016bra went to see Arjuna after his successful kidnapping of Subhadr\u0101. Both of them presented dowries to Arjuna after this incident. Akr\u016bra was present also when Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadr\u0101, was married with Uttar\u0101, mother of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. Ah\u016bka, the father-in-law of Akr\u016bra, was not on good terms with Akr\u016bra. But both of them were devotees of the Lord. Ugrasena: One of the powerful kings of the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i dynasty and cousin of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kuntibhoja. His other name is Ah\u016bka. His minister was Vasudeva, and his son was the powerful Ka\u1e41sa. This Ka\u1e41sa imprisoned his father and became the King of Mathur\u0101. By the grace of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His brother, Lord Baladeva, Ka\u1e41sa was killed, and Ugrasena was reinstalled on the throne. When \u015a\u0101lva attacked the city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, Ugrasena fought very valiantly and repulsed the enemy. Ugrasena inquired from N\u0101radaj\u012b about the divinity of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When the Yadu dynasty was to be vanquished, Ugrasena was entrusted with the iron lump produced from the womb of S\u0101mba. He cut the iron lump into pieces and then pasted it and mixed it up with the sea water on the coast of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. After this, he ordered complete prohibition within the city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 and the kingdom. He got salvation after his death. Baladeva: He is the divine son of Vasudeva by his wife Rohi\u1e47\u012b. He is also known as Rohi\u1e47\u012b-nandana, the beloved son of Rohi\u1e47\u012b. He was also entrusted to Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja along with His mother, Rohi\u1e47\u012b, when Vasudeva embraced imprisonment by mutual agreement with Ka\u1e41sa. So Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is also the foster father of Baladeva along with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord Baladeva were constant companions from Their very childhood, although They were stepbrothers. He is the plenary manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He is as good and powerful as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He belongs to the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva (the principle of Godhead). He attended the svaya\u1e41vara ceremony of Draupad\u012b along with \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When Subhadr\u0101 was kidnapped by Arjuna by the organized plan of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Baladeva was very angry with Arjuna and wanted to kill him at once. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for the sake of His dear friend, fell at the feet of Lord Baladeva and implored Him not to be so angry. \u015ar\u012b Baladeva was thus satisfied. Similarly, He was once very angry with the Kauravas, and He wanted to throw their whole city into the depths of the Yamun\u0101. But the Kauravas satisfied Him by surrendering unto His divine lotus feet. He was actually the seventh son of Devak\u012b prior to the birth of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but by the will of the Lord He was transferred to the womb of Rohi\u1e47\u012b to escape the wrath of Ka\u1e41sa. His other name is therefore Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, who is also the plenary portion of \u015ar\u012b Baladeva. Because He is as powerful as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and can bestow spiritual power to the devotees, He is therefore known as Baladeva. In the Vedas also it is enjoined that no one can know the Supreme Lord without being favored by Baladeva. Bala means spiritual strength, not physical. Some less intelligent persons interpret bala as the strength of the body. But no one can have spiritual realization by physical strength. Physical strength ends with the end of the physical body, but spiritual strength follows the spirit soul to the next transmigration, and therefore the strength obtained by Baladeva is never wasted. The strength is eternal, and thus Baladeva is the original spiritual master of all devotees. \u015ar\u012b Baladeva was also a class friend of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a student of S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni. In His childhood He killed many asuras along with \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and specifically He killed the Dhenuk\u0101sura at T\u0101lavana. During the Kuruk\u1e63etra battle, He remained neutral, and He tried His best not to bring about the fight. He was in favor of Duryodhana, but still He remained neutral. When there was a club-fight between Duryodhana and Bh\u012bmasena, He was present on the spot. He was angry at Bh\u012bmasena when the latter struck Duryodhana on the thigh or below the belt, and He wanted to retaliate the unfair action. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a saved Bh\u012bma from His wrath. But He left the place at once, being disgusted at Bh\u012bmasena, and after His departure Duryodhana fell to the ground to meet his death. The funeral ceremony of Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, was performed by Him, as He was the maternal uncle. It was impossible to be performed by any one of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were all overwhelmed with grief. At the last stage, He departed from this world by producing a great white snake from His mouth, and thus He was carried by \u015ae\u1e63an\u0101ga in the shape of a serpent. Pradyumna: Incarnation of K\u0101madeva or, according to others, incarnation of Sanat-kum\u0101ra, born as the son of the Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and Lak\u1e63m\u012bdev\u012b, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Rukmi\u1e47\u012b, the principal queen at Dv\u0101rak\u0101. He was one of those who went to congratulate Arjuna upon his marrying Subhadr\u0101. He was one of the great generals who fought with \u015a\u0101lva, and while fighting with him he became unconscious on the battlefield. His charioteer brought him back to the camp from the battlefield, and for this action he was very sorry and rebuked his charioteer. However, he fought again with \u015a\u0101lva and was victorious. He heard all about the different demigods from N\u0101radaj\u012b. He is one of the four plenary expansions of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the third one. He inquired from his father, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, about the glories of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. During the fratricidal war amongst the descendants of Yadu, he died at the hand of Bhoja, another king of the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is. After his death, he was installed in his original position. C\u0101rude\u1e63\u1e47a: Another son of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Rukmi\u1e47\u012bdev\u012b. He was also present during the svaya\u1e41vara ceremony of Draupad\u012b. He was a great warrior like his brothers and father. He fought with Vivinidhaka and killed him in the fight. S\u0101mba: One of the great heroes of the Yadu dynasty and the son of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by His wife J\u0101mbavat\u012b. He learned the military art of throwing arrows from Arjuna, and he became a member of parliament during the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. He was present during the R\u0101jas\u016bya-yaj\u00f1a of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. When all the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is were assembled during the time of Prabh\u0101sa-yaj\u00f1a, his glorious activities were narrated by S\u0101tyaki before Lord Baladeva. He was also present along with his father, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, during the a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1a performed by Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. He was presented before some \u1e5b\u1e63is falsely dressed as a pregnant woman by his brothers, and in fun he asked the \u1e5b\u1e63is what he was going to deliver. The \u1e5b\u1e63is replied that he would deliver a lump of iron, which would be the cause of fratricidal war in the family of Yadu. The next day, in the morning, S\u0101mba delivered a large lump of iron, which was entrusted to Ugrasena for necessary action. Actually later on there was the foretold fratricidal war, and S\u0101mba died in that war. So all these sons of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a left their respective palaces and leaving aside all engagements, including lying down, sitting and dining, hastened toward their exalted father."

        "purport": " We may not hate even the prostitutes if they are devotees of the Lord. Even to date there are many prostitutes in great cities of India who are sincere devotees of the Lord. By tricks of chance one may be obliged to adopt a profession which is not very adorable in society, but that does not hamper one in executing devotional service to the Lord. Devotional service to the Lord is uncheckable in all circumstances. It is understood herewith that even in those days, about five thousand years ago, there were prostitutes in a city like Dv\u0101rak\u0101, where Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a resided. This means that prostitutes are necessary citizens for the proper upkeep of society. The government opens wine shops, but this does not mean that the government encourages the drinking of wine. The idea is that there is a class of men who will drink at any cost, and it has been experienced that prohibition in great cities encouraged illicit smuggling of wine. Similarly, men who are not satisfied at home require such concessions, and if there is no prostitute, then such low men will induce others into prostitution. It is better that prostitutes be available in the marketplace so that the sanctity of society can be maintained. It is better to maintain a class of prostitutes than to encourage prostitutes within society. The real reformation is to enlighten all people to become devotees of the Lord, and that will check all kinds of deteriorating factors of life. \u015ar\u012b Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a great \u0101c\u0101rya of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47usv\u0101m\u012b Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sect, in his householder life was overly attached to a prostitute who happened to be a devotee of the Lord. One night when the \u1e6ch\u0101kura came to Cint\u0101ma\u1e47i\u2019s house in torrents of rain and thunder, Cint\u0101ma\u1e47i was astonished to see how the \u1e6ch\u0101kura could come on such a dreadful night after crossing a foaming river which was full of waves. She said to \u1e6ch\u0101kura Bilvama\u1e45gala that his attraction for the flesh and bone of an insignificant woman like her would be properly utilized if it could be diverted to the devotional service of the Lord to achieve attraction for the transcendental beauty of the Lord. It was a momentous hour for the \u1e6ch\u0101kura, and he took a turn towards spiritual realization by the words of a prostitute. Later on the \u1e6ch\u0101kura accepted the prostitute as his spiritual master, and in several places of his literary works he has glorified the name of Cint\u0101ma\u1e47i, who showed him the right path. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.32) the Lord says, \u201cO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, even the low-born ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las and those who are born in a family of unbelievers, and even the prostitutes, shall attain perfection of life if they take shelter of unalloyed devotional service to Me, because in the path of devotional service there are no impediments due to degraded birth and occupation. The path is open for everyone who agrees to follow it.\u201d It appears that the prostitutes of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, who were so eager to meet the Lord, were all His unalloyed devotees, and thus they were all on the path of salvation according to the above version of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Therefore, the only reformation that is necessary in society is to make an organized effort to turn the citizens into devotees of the Lord, and thus all good qualities of the denizens of heaven will overtake them in their own way. On the other hand, those who are nondevotees have no good qualifications whatsoever, however they may be materially advanced. The difference is that the devotees of the Lord are on the path of liberation, whereas the nondevotees are on the path of further entanglement in material bondage. The criterion of advancement of civilization is whether the people are educated and advanced on the path of salvation."

        "purport": " It appears that five thousand years ago the society also needed the services of the dramatists, artists, dancers, singers, historians, genealogists, public speakers, etc. Dancers, singers and dramatic artists mostly hailed from the \u015b\u016bdra community, whereas the learned historians, genealogists and public speakers hailed from the br\u0101hma\u1e47a community. All of them belonged to a particular caste, and they became so trained in their respective families. Such dramatists, dancers, singers, historians, genealogists and public speakers would dwell on the subject of the Lord\u2019s superhuman activities in different ages and millenniums, and not on ordinary events. Nor were they in chronological order. All the Pur\u0101\u1e47as are historical facts described only in relation with the Supreme Lord in different ages and times as well as on different planets also. Therefore, we do not find any chronological order. The modern historians, therefore, cannot catch up the link, and thus they unauthoritatively remark that the Pur\u0101\u1e47as are all imaginary stories only. Even one hundred years ago in India, all dramatic performances were centered around the superhuman activities of the Supreme Lord. The common people would be verily entertained by the performances of dramas, and y\u0101tr\u0101 parties played wonderfully on the superhuman activities of the Lord, and thus even the illiterate agriculturist would be a participant in the knowledge of Vedic literature, despite a considerable lack of academic qualifications. Therefore, expert players in drama, dancers, singers, speakers, etc., are required for the spiritual enlightenment of the common man. The genealogists would give account completely of the descendants of a particular family. Even at the present moment the guides in the pilgrimage sites of India submit a complete account of genealogical tables before a newcomer. This wonderful act sometimes attracts more customers to receive such important information."

        "purport": " To have a look at the Lord is a great festive occasion undoubtedly, as it was considered by the metropolitan ladies of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. This is still followed by the devout ladies of India. Especially during the days of the Jhulana and Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b ceremonies, the ladies of India still throng up in the greatest number at the temple of the Lord, where His transcendental eternal form is worshiped. The transcendental form of the Lord installed in a temple is not different from the Lord personally. Such a form of the Lord is called arca-vigraha, or arc\u0101 incarnation, and is expanded by the Lord by His internal potency just to facilitate the devotional service of His innumerable devotees who are in the material world. The material senses cannot perceive the spiritual nature of the Lord, and therefore the Lord accepts the arca-vigraha, which is apparently made of material elements like earth, wood and stone, but actually there is no material contamination. The Lord being kaivalya (one alone), there is no matter in Him. He is one without a second, and therefore the almighty Lord can appear in any form without being contaminated by the material conception. Therefore, festivities in the temple of the Lord, as held generally, are like festivals performed during the manifestive days of the Lord of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, about five thousand years ago. The authorized \u0101c\u0101ryas, who know the science perfectly, install such temples of the Lord under regulative principles just to offer facilities to the common man, but persons who are less intelligent, without being conversant with the science, mistake this great attempt to be idol worship and poke their nose into that to which they have no access. Therefore, the ladies or men who observe festivals in the temples of the Lord just to have a look at the transcendental form are a thousand times more glorious than those who are nonbelievers in the transcendental form of the Lord. It appears from the verse that the inhabitants of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 were all owners of big palaces. This indicates the prosperity of the city. The ladies got up on the roofs just to have a look at the procession and the Lord. The ladies did not mix with the crowd on the street, and thus their respectability was perfectly observed. There was no artificial equality with the man. Female respectability is preserved more elegantly by keeping the woman separate from the man. The sexes should not mix unrestrictedly."

        "purport": " When the ladies of the city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 got up on the roofs of their palaces, they never thought that they had previously many times seen the beautiful body of the infallible Lord. This indicates that they had no satiation in desiring to see the Lord. Anything material seen for a number of times ultimately becomes unattractive by the law of satiation. The law of satiation acts materially, but there is no scope for it in the spiritual realm. The word infallible is significant here, because although the Lord has mercifully descended to the earth, He is still infallible. The living entities are fallible because when they come in contact with the material world they lack their spiritual identity, and thus the body materially obtained becomes subjected to birth, growth, transformation, situation, deterioration and annihilation under the laws of nature. The Lord\u2019s body is not like that. He descends as He is and is never under the laws of the material modes. His body is the source of everything that be, the reservoir of all beauties beyond our experience. No one, therefore, is satiated by seeing the transcendental body of the Lord because there are always manifestations of newer and newer beauties. The transcendental name, form, qualities, entourage, etc., are all spiritual manifestations, and there is no satiation in chanting the holy name of the Lord, there is no satiation in discussing the qualities of the Lord, and there is no limitation of the entourage of the Lord. He is the source of all and is limitless."

His arms are the resting places for the administrative demigods. And His lotus feet are the refuge of pure devotees who never talk or sing of any subject except His Lordship.",
        "purport": " There are different classes of human beings, all seeking different enjoyments from different objects. There are persons who are seeking after the favor of the goddess of fortune, and for them the Vedic literatures give information that the Lord is always served with all reverence by thousands and thousands of goddesses of fortune at the cint\u0101ma\u1e47i-dh\u0101ma,* the transcendental abode of the Lord where the trees are all desire trees and the buildings are made of touchstone. The Lord Govinda is engaged there in herding the surabhi cows as His natural occupation. These goddesses of fortune can be seen automatically if we are attracted by the bodily features of the Lord. The impersonalists cannot observe such goddesses of fortune because of their dry speculative habit. And those who are artists, overtaken by the beautiful creation, should better see to the beautiful face of the Lord for complete satisfaction. The face of the Lord is the embodiment of beauty. What they call beautiful nature is but His smile, and what they call the sweet songs of the birds are but specimens of the whispering voice of the Lord. There are administrative demigods in charge of departmental service of cosmic management, and there are tiny administrative gods in the state service. They are always afraid of other competitors, but if they take shelter of the arms of the Lord, the Lord can protect them always from the attacks of enemies. A faithful servant of the Lord engaged in the service of administration is the ideal executive head and can well protect the interest of the people in general. Other so-called administrators are symbols of anachronisms leading to the acute distress of the people who are governed by them. The administrators can remain safely under the protection of the arms of the Lord. The essence of everything is the Supreme Lord: He is called the s\u0101ram. And those who sing and talk about Him are called the s\u0101ra\u1e45gas, or the pure devotees. The pure devotees are always hankering after the lotus feet of the Lord. The lotus has a kind of honey which is transcendentally relished by the devotees. They are like the bees who are always after the honey. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the great devotee \u0101c\u0101rya of the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava samprad\u0101ya, has sung a song about this lotus honey, comparing himself to the bee: \u201cO my Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I beg to offer my prayers unto You. My mind is like the bee, and it is after some honey. Kindly, therefore, give my bee-mind a place at Your lotus feet, which are the resources for all transcendental honey. I know that even big demigods like Brahm\u0101 do not see the rays of the nails of Your lotus feet, even though they are engaged in deep meditation for years together. Still, O infallible one, my ambition is such, for You are very merciful to your surrendered devotees. O M\u0101dhava, I know also that I have no genuine devotion for the service of Your lotus feet, but because Your Lordship is inconceivably powerful, You can do what is impossible to be done. Your lotus feet can deride even the nectar of the heavenly kingdom, and therefore I am very much attracted by them. O supreme eternal, please, therefore, let my mind be fixed at Your lotus feet so that eternally I may be able to relish the taste of Your transcendental service.\u201d The devotees are satisfied with being placed at the lotus feet of the Lord and have no ambition to see His all-beautiful face or aspire for the protection of the strong arms of the Lord. They are humble by nature, and the Lord is always leaning towards such humble devotees."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also did not distinguish His real mother from His stepmothers, and He equally offered His obeisances unto all the wives of Vasudeva present on the occasion. According to scriptures also, there are seven mothers: (1) the real mother, (2) the wife of the spiritual master, (3) the wife of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, (4) the wife of the king, (5) the cow, (6) the nurse, and (7) the earth.

        "translation": "The queens of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a rejoiced within their minds to see their husband home after a long period abroad. The queens got up at once from their seats and meditations. As was socially customary, they covered their faces shyly and looked about coyly.",
        "purport": " As mentioned above, the Lord entered His home palaces occupied by 16,108 queens. This means that the Lord at once expanded Himself in as many plenary expansions as there were queens and palaces and entered in each and every one of them simultaneously and separately. Here is another manifestation of the feature of His internal potency. He can expand Himself in as many forms of spiritual identity as He desires, even though He is one without a second. It is confirmed by the \u015aruti-mantra that the Absolute is one alone, and yet He becomes many as soon as He so desires. These manifold expansions of the Supreme Lord are manifested as plenary and separated portions. The separated portions are representations of His energy, and the plenary portions are manifestations of His Personality. Thus the Personality of Godhead manifested Himself in 16,108 plenary expansions and simultaneously entered into each and every one of the palaces of the queens. This is called vaibhava, or the transcendental potency of the Lord. And because He can do so, He is also known as Yoge\u015bvara. Ordinarily, a yog\u012b or mystic living being is able to expand himself at utmost to tenfold expansions of his body, but the Lord can do so to the extent of as many thousands or infinitely, as He likes. Unbelievers become astonished to learn that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a married more than sixteen thousand queens because they think of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as one of them and measure the potency of the Lord by their own limited potency. One should know, therefore, that the Lord is never on the level of the living beings, who are but expansions of His marginal potency, and one should never equalize the potent and the potency, although there is very little difference of quality between the potent and the potency. The queens were also expansions of His internal potency, and thus the potent and potencies are perpetually exchanging transcendental pleasures, known as pastimes of the Lord. One should not, therefore, become astonished to learn that the Lord married so many wives. On the contrary, one should affirm that even if the Lord marries sixteen thousand million wives, He is not completely manifesting His unlimited and inexhaustible potency. He married only sixteen thousand wives and entered in each and every one of the different palaces just to impress in the history of the human beings on the surface of the earth that the Lord is never equal to or less than any human being, however powerful he may be. No one, therefore, is either equal to or greater than the Lord. The Lord is always great in all respects. \u201cGod is great\u201d is eternal truth. Therefore, as soon as the queens saw from a distance their husband, who was away from home for long periods due to the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, they all arose from the slumber of meditation and prepared to receive their most beloved. According to Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya\u2019s religious injunctions, a woman whose husband is away from home should not take part in any social functions, should not decorate her body, should not laugh and should not go to any relative\u2019s house in any circumstance. This is the vow of the ladies whose husbands are away from home. At the same time, it is also enjoined that a wife should never present herself before the husband in an unclean state. She must decorate herself with ornaments and good dress and should always be present before the husband in a happy and joyous mood. The queens of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were all in meditation, thinking of the Lord\u2019s absence, and were always meditating upon Him. The Lord\u2019s devotees cannot live for a moment without meditating on the Lord, and what to speak of the queens, who were all goddesses of fortune incarnated as queens in the pastimes of the Lord at Dv\u0101rak\u0101. They can never be separated from the Lord, either by presence or by trance. The gop\u012bs at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana could not forget the Lord when the Lord was away in the forest cowherding. When the Lord boy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was absent from the village, the gop\u012bs at home used to worry about Him traversing the rough ground with His soft lotus feet. By thinking thus, they were sometimes overwhelmed in trance and mortified in the heart. Such is the condition of the pure associates of the Lord. They are always in trance, and so the queens also were in trance during the absence of the Lord. Presently, having seen the Lord from a distance, they at once gave up all their engagements, including the vows of women as described above. According to \u015ar\u012b Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Carkavart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, there was a regular psychological reaction on the occasion. First of all, rising from their seats, although they wanted to see their husband, they were deterred because of feminine shyness. But due to strong ecstasy, they overcame that stage of weakness and became caught up with the idea of embracing the Lord, and this thought factually made them unconscious of their surrounding environment. This prime state of ecstasy annihilated all other formalities and social conventions, and thus they escaped all stumbling blocks on the path of meeting the Lord. And that is the perfect stage of meeting the Lord of the soul, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

Still, the act remained unfinished, and tears rolled down their cheeks despite all endeavors to check them. One indirectly embraces the husband by sending the son to embrace him because the son is developed as part of the mother\u2019s body. The embrace of the son is not exactly the embrace of husband and wife from the sexual point of view, but the embrace is satisfaction from the affectionate point of view. The embrace of the eyes is more effective in the conjugal relation, and thus according to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b there is nothing wrong in such an exchange of feeling between husband and wife."

The goddess of fortune, although by nature always restless and moving, could not quit the Lord\u2019s feet. So what woman can be detached from those feet, having once taken shelter of them?",
        "purport": " Conditioned living beings are always after the favor of the goddess of fortune, although by nature she is moving from one place to another. In the material world no one is permanently fortunate, however clever one may be. There have been so many big empires in different parts of the world, there have been so many powerful kings all over the world, and there have been so many fortunate men, but all of them have been liquidated gradually. This is the law of material nature. But spiritually it is different. According to Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the Lord is served very respectfully by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. They are always in a lonely place also with the Lord. But still the association of the Lord is so inspiringly newer and newer that they cannot quit the Lord for a moment, even though they are by nature very restless and are moving about. The spiritual relation with the Lord is so enlivening and resourceful that no one can leave the company of the Lord, once having taken shelter of Him. The living beings are by constitution feminine by nature. The male or enjoyer is the Lord, and all manifestations of His different potencies are feminine by nature. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the living beings are designated as par\u0101-prak\u1e5bti, or the superior potency. The material elements are apar\u0101-prak\u1e5bti, or inferior potency. Such potencies are always employed for the satisfaction of the employer, or the enjoyer. The supreme enjoyer is the Lord Himself, as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29). The potencies, therefore, when engaged directly in the service of the Lord, revive the natural color, and thus there is no disparity in the relation of the potent and potency. Generally people engaged in service are always seeking some post under the government or the supreme enjoyer of the state. Since the Lord is the supreme enjoyer of everything in or outside the universe, it is happiness to be employed by Him. Once engaged in the supreme governmental service of the Lord, no living being wishes to be relieved from the engagement. The highest perfection of human life is to seek some employment under the Lord\u2019s supreme service. That will make one extremely happy. One need not seek the moving goddess of fortune without the relation of the Lord."

        "translation": "The Lord was pacified after killing those kings who were burdensome to the earth. They were puffed up with their military strength, their horses, elephants, chariots, infantry, etc. He Himself was not a party in the fight. He simply created hostility between the powerful administrators, and they fought amongst themselves. He was like the wind which causes friction between bamboos and so sparks a fire.",
        "purport": " As stated above, the living beings are not factual enjoyers of things which are manifested as God\u2019s creation. The Lord is the genuine proprietor and enjoyer of everything manifested in His creation. Unfortunately, influenced by the deluding energy, the living being becomes a false enjoyer under the dictation of the modes of nature. Puffed up by such a false sense of becoming God, the deluded living being increases his material strength by so many activities and thus becomes the burden of the earth, so much so that the earth becomes completely uninhabitable by the sane. This state of affairs is called dharmasya gl\u0101ni\u1e25, or misuse of the energy of the human being. When such misuse of human energy is prominent, the saner living beings become perturbed by the awkward situation created by the vicious administrators, who are simply burdens of the earth, and the Lord appears by His internal potency just to save the saner section of humanity and to alleviate the burden due to the earthly administrators in different parts of the world. He does not favor either of the unwanted administrators, but by His potential power He creates hostility between such unwanted administrators, as the air creates fire in the forest by the friction of the bamboos. The fire in the forest takes place automatically by the force of the air, and similarly the hostility between different groups of politicians takes place by the unseen design of the Lord. The unwanted administrators, puffed up by false power and military strength, thus become engaged in fighting amongst themselves over ideological conflicts and so exhaust themselves of all powers. The history of the world reflects this factual will of the Lord, and it will continue to be enacted until the living beings are attached to the service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14) this fact is very vividly described. It is said, \u201cThe deluding energy is My potency, and thus it is not possible for the dependent living beings to supersede the strength of the material modes. But those who take shelter in Me [the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a] can cross over the gigantic ocean of material energy.\u201d This means that no one can establish peace and prosperity in the world by fruitive activities or by speculative philosophy or ideology. The only way is to surrender unto the Supreme Lord and thus become free from the illusion of the deluding energy. Unfortunately persons who are engaged in destructive work are unable to surrender to the Personality of Godhead. They are all fools of the first order; they are the lowest of the human species of life; they are robbed of their knowledge, although apparently they seem to be academically educated. They are all of the demoniac mentality, always challenging the supreme power of the Lord. Those who are very materialistic, always hankering after material power and strength, are undoubtedly fools of the first order because they have no information of the living energy, and being ignorant of that supreme spiritual science, they are absorbed in material science, which ends with the end of the material body. They are the lowest of human beings because the human life is especially meant for reestablishing the lost relation with the Lord, and they miss this opportunity by being engaged in material activities. They are robbed of their knowledge because even after prolonged speculation they cannot reach to the stage of knowing the Personality of Godhead, the summum bonum of everything. And all of them are men of demoniac principle, and they suffer the consequences, as did such materialistic heroes as R\u0101va\u1e47a, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, Ka\u1e41sa and others."

        "purport": " The Lord married and lived like a householder. This is certainly like a mundane affair, but when we learn that He married 16,108 wives and lived with them separately in each and every palace, certainly it is not mundane. Therefore, the Lord, living as a householder amongst His competent wives, is never mundane, and His behavior with them is never to be understood as mundane sex relation. The women who became the wives of the Lord are certainly not ordinary women, because to get the Lord as one\u2019s husband is the result of many, many millions of births\u2019 tapasya (austerity). When the Lord appears on different lokas, or planets, or on this planet of human beings, He displays His transcendental pastimes just to attract the conditioned souls to become His eternal servitors, friends, parents and lovers respectively in the transcendental world, where the Lord eternally reciprocates such exchanges of service. Service is pervertedly represented in the material world and broken untimely, resulting in sad experience. The illusioned living being conditioned by material nature cannot understand out of ignorance that all our relations here in the mundane world are temporary and full of inebrieties. Such relations cannot help us be happy perpetually, but if the same relation is established with the Lord, then we are transferred to the transcendental world after leaving this material body and become eternally related with Him in the relation we desire. The women amongst whom He lived as their husband are not, therefore, women of this mundane world, but are eternally related with Him as transcendental wives, a position which they attained by perfection of devotional service. That is their competency. The Lord is para\u1e41 brahma, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Conditioned souls seek after perpetual happiness in all places \u2014 not only on this earth but also on other planets throughout the universe \u2014 because constitutionally a spiritual spark, as he is, can travel to any part of God\u2019s creation. But being conditioned by the material modes, he tries to travel in space by spacecraft and so fails to reach his destination. The law of gravitation is binding upon him like the shackles of a prisoner. By other processes he can reach anywhere, but even if he reaches the highest planet, he cannot attain that perpetual happiness for which he is searching life after life. When he comes to his senses, however, he seeks after Brahman happiness, knowing it for certain that unlimited happiness, which he is seeking, is never attainable in the material world. As such, the Supreme Being, Parabrahman, certainly does not seek His happiness anywhere in the material world. Nor can His paraphernalia of happiness be found in the material world. He is not impersonal. Because He is the leader and Supreme Being amongst innumerable living beings, He cannot be impersonal. He is exactly like us, and He has all the propensities of an individual living being in fullness. He marries exactly like us, but His marriage is neither mundane nor limited by our experience in the conditioned state. His wives, therefore, appear like mundane women, but factually they are all transcendental liberated souls, perfect manifestations of internal energy."

        "translation": "Although the queens\u2019 beautiful smiles and furtive glances were all spotless and exciting, and although they could conquer Cupid himself by making him give up his bow in frustration, and although even the tolerant \u015aiva could fall victim to them, still, despite all their magical feats and attractions, they could not agitate the senses of the Lord.",
        "purport": " The path of salvation or the path going back to Godhead always forbids the association of women, and the complete san\u0101tana-dharma or var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma scheme forbids or restricts association with women. How then can one be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is addicted to more than sixteen thousand wives? This question may be relevantly raised by inquisitive persons really anxious to know about the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord. And to answer such questions, the sages at Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya have discussed the transcendental character of the Lord in this and in following verses. It is clear herein that the feminine attractive features which can conquer Cupid or even the supermost tolerant Lord \u015aiva could not conquer the senses of the Lord. Cupid\u2019s business is to invoke mundane lust. The whole universe is moving, being agitated by Cupid\u2019s arrow. The activities of the world are being carried on by the central attraction of male and female. A male is searching after a mate to his liking, and the female is looking after a suitable male. That is the way of material stimulus. And as soon as a male is combined with a female, the material bondage of the living being is at once tightly interlocked by sex relation, and as a result of this, both the male\u2019s and female\u2019s attraction for sweet home, motherland, bodily offspring, society and friendship and accumulation of wealth becomes the illusory field of activities, and thus a false but indefatigable attraction for the temporary material existence, which is full of miseries, is manifest. Those who are, therefore, on the path of salvation for going back home, back to Godhead, are especially advised by all scriptural instruction to become free from such paraphernalia of material attraction. And that is possible only by the association of the devotees of the Lord, who are called the mah\u0101tm\u0101s. Cupid throws his arrow upon the living beings to make them mad after the opposite sex, whether the party is actually beautiful or not. Cupid\u2019s provocations are going on, even among beastly societies who are all ugly-looking in the estimation of the civilized nations. Thus Cupid\u2019s influence is exerted even amongst the ugliest forms, and what to speak of the most perfect beauties. Lord \u015aiva, who is considered to be most tolerant, was also struck by Cupid\u2019s arrow because he also became mad after the Mohin\u012b incarnation of the Lord and acknowledged himself to be defeated. Cupid, however, was himself captivated by the grave and exciting dealings of the goddesses of fortune, and he voluntarily gave up his bow and arrow in a spirit of frustration. Such was the beauty and attraction of the queens of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Yet they could not disturb the transcendental senses of the Lord. This is because the Lord is all-perfect \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma, or self-sufficient. He does not require anyone\u2019s extraneous help for His personal satisfaction. Therefore, the queens could not satisfy the Lord by their feminine attractiveness, but they satisfied Him by their sincere affection and service. Only by unalloyed transcendental loving service could they satisfy the Lord, and the Lord was pleased to treat them as wives in reciprocation. Thus being satisfied by their unalloyed service only, the Lord reciprocated the service just like a devout husband. Otherwise He had no business becoming the husband of so many wives. He is the husband of everyone, but to one who accepts Him as such, He reciprocates. This unalloyed affection for the Lord is never to be compared to mundane lust. It is purely transcendental. And the grave dealings, which the queens displayed in natural feminine ways, were also transcendental because the feelings were expressed out of transcendental ecstasy. It is already explained in the previous verse that the Lord appeared like a mundane husband, but factually His relation with His wives was transcendental, pure and unconditioned by the modes of material nature."

Due to ignorance only, the foolish mundane wranglers misunderstand the Supreme Lord and spread their foolish imaginations amongst innocent persons by propaganda. The Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original primeval Personality of Godhead, and when He was personally present before the eyes of everyone, He displayed full-fledged divine potency in every field of activities. As we have already explained in the first verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, He is completely independent to act however He likes, but all His actions are full of bliss, knowledge and eternity. Only the foolish mundaners misunderstand Him, unaware of His eternal form of knowledge and bliss, which is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and Upani\u1e63ads. His different potencies work in a perfect plan of natural sequence, and doing everything by the agency of His different potencies, He remains eternally the supreme independent. When He descends to the material world by His causeless mercy to different living beings, He does so by His own potency. He is not subject to any condition of the material modes of nature, and He descends as He is originally. The mental speculators misunderstand Him as the Supreme Person, and they consider His impersonal features as inexplicable Brahman to be all. Such a conception is also the product of conditioned life because they cannot go beyond their own personal capacity. Therefore, one who considers the Lord on the level of one\u2019s limited potency is only a common man. Such a man cannot be convinced that the Personality of Godhead is always unaffected by the modes of material nature. He cannot understand that the sun is always unaffected by infectious matter. The mental speculators compare everything from the standpoint of experimental knowledge of their own selves. Thus when the Lord is found to act like an ordinary person in matrimonial bondage, they consider Him to be like one of them, without considering that the Lord can at once marry sixteen thousand wives or more. Due to a poor fund of knowledge they accept one side of the picture while disbelieving the other. This means that due to ignorance only they always think of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as like themselves and make their own conclusions, which are absurd and unauthentic from the version of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

        "purport": " In the Vedas and Vedic literatures (\u015bruti and sm\u1e5bti) it is affirmed that in the Divinity there is nothing material. He is transcendental (nirgu\u1e47a), the supreme cognizant. Hari, or the Personality of Godhead, is the supreme transcendental person situated beyond the range of material affection. These statements are also confirmed even by \u0100c\u0101rya \u015aa\u1e45kara. One may argue that His relation with the goddesses of fortune may be transcendental, but what about His relation with the Yadu dynasty, being born in that family, or His killing the nonbelievers like Jar\u0101sandha and other asuras directly in contact with the modes of material nature? The answer is that the divinity of the Personality of Godhead is never in contact with the qualities of material nature in any circumstances. Actually He is in contact with such qualities because He is the ultimate source of everything, yet He is above the actions of such qualities. He is known, therefore, as Yoge\u015bvara, or the master of mystic power, or in other words the all-powerful. Even His learned devotees are not affected by the influence of the material modes. The great Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana all came from greatly rich and aristocratic families, but when they adopted the life of mendicants at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, superficially they appeared to be in wretched conditions of life, but factually they were the richest of all in spiritual values. Such mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavatas, or first-grade devotees, although moving amongst men, are not contaminated by honor or insult, hunger or satisfaction, sleep or wakefulness, which are all resultant actions of the three modes of material nature. Similarly, some of them are engaged in worldly dealings, yet are unaffected. Unless these neutralities of life are there, one cannot be considered situated in transcendence. The Divinity and His associates are on the same transcendental plane, and their glories are always sanctified by the action of yogam\u0101y\u0101, or the internal potency of the Lord. The devotees of the Lord are always transcendental, even if they are sometimes found to have fallen in their behavior. The Lord emphatically declares in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.30) that even if an unalloyed devotee is found to be fallen due to a previous material contamination, he is nevertheless to be accepted as fully transcendental because of his being engaged cent percent in the devotional service of the Lord. The Lord protects him always because of his rendering service unto Him, and the fallen conditions are to be considered accidental and temporary. They will vanish in no time."

        "translation": "The simple and delicate women truly thought that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, their beloved husband, followed them and was dominated by them. They were unaware of the extent of the glories of their husband, as the atheists are unaware of Him as the supreme controller.",
        "purport": " Even the transcendental wives of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not know completely the unfathomable glories of the Lord. This ignorance is not mundane because there is some action of the internal potency of the Lord in the exchange of feelings between Him and His eternal associates. The Lord exchanges transcendental relations in five ways, as proprietor, master, friend, son and lover, and in each of these pastimes He plays fully by the potency of yogam\u0101y\u0101, the internal potency. He plays exactly like an equal friend with the cowherd boys or even with friends like Arjuna. He plays exactly like a son in the presence of Ya\u015bod\u0101m\u0101t\u0101, He plays exactly like a lover in the presence of the cowherd damsels, and He plays exactly like a husband in the presence of the queens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. Such devotees of the Lord never think of the Lord as the Supreme, but think of Him exactly as a common friend, a pet son, or a lover or husband very much dear to heart and soul. That is the relation between the Lord and His transcendental devotees, who act as His associates in the spiritual sky, where there are innumerable Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. When the Lord descends, He does so along with His entourage to display a complete picture of the transcendental world, where pure love and devotion for the Lord prevail without any mundane tinge of lording it over the creation of the Lord. Such devotees of the Lord are all liberated souls, perfect representations of the marginal or internal potency in complete negation of the influence of the external potency. The wives of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were made to forget the immeasurable glories of the Lord by the internal potency so that there might not be any flaw of exchange, and they took it for granted that the Lord was a henpecked husband, always following them in lonely places. In other words, even the personal associates of the Lord do not know Him perfectly well, so what do the thesis writers or mental speculators know about the transcendental glories of the Lord? The mental speculators present different theses as to His becoming the cause of the creation, the ingredients of the creation, or the material and efficient causes of the creation, etc., but all this is but partial knowledge about the Lord. Factually they are as ignorant as the common man. The Lord can be known by the mercy of the Lord only, and by no other means. But since the dealings of the Lord with His wives are based on pure transcendental love and devotion, the wives are all on the transcendental plane without material contamination."
