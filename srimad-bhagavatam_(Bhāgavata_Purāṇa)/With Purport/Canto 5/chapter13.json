Being captivated by the material world under the influence of the three modes of material nature (sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a), the living entity can see only the three fruits of activities under the spell of material nature. These fruits are auspicious, inauspicious and mixed. He thus becomes attached to religion, economic development, sense gratification and the monistic theory of liberation (merging with the Supreme). He works very hard day and night exactly like a merchant who enters a forest to acquire some articles to sell later for profit. However, he cannot really achieve happiness within this material world.",

Not knowing what the path of sense gratification is, one becomes implicated in the repetition of birth and accepts different types of bodies again and again. Thus one suffers in material existence. In this life one may think that he is very happy being an American, Indian, Englishman or German, but in the next life one has to accept another body among 8,400,000 species. The next body has to be immediately accepted according to karma. One will be forced to accept a certain type of body, and protesting will not help. That is the stringent law of nature. Due to the living entity\u2019s ignorance of his eternal blissful life, he becomes attracted to material activities under the spell of m\u0101y\u0101. In this world, he can never experience happiness, yet he works very hard to do so. This is called m\u0101y\u0101."

Everyone works very hard to earn money, but no one knows that his real self-interest is in serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Instead of spending money for advancing the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, one spends his hard-earned money on clubs, brothels, liquor, slaughterhouses and so forth. Due to sinful activities, one becomes implicated in the process of transmigration and thus has to accept one body after another. Being thus absorbed in a distressed condition, one never attains happiness."

The material world is full of envious people. Even within one\u2019s inner circle there is much backbiting, and this is compared to the sound vibration of a cricket in the forest. One cannot see the cricket, but one hears its sounds and thus becomes aggrieved. When one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one always hears unpalatable words from relatives. This is the nature of the world; one cannot avoid mental distress due to the backbiting of envious people. Being very much aggrieved, sometimes one goes to a sinful person for help, but he has no means to help because he has no intelligence. Thus the living entity is disappointed. This is like running after a mirage in the desert in an effort to find water. Such activities do not produce any tangible results. Due to being directed by the illusory energy, a conditioned soul suffers in so many ways."

Sometimes he suffers from the burning heat of household life, which is like a forest fire, and sometimes he becomes sad to have his wealth, which is as dear as life, plundered by kings in the name of heavy income taxes.",
        "purport": " When one is hot due to the scorching sun, one sometimes jumps into a river to gain relief. However, if the river is almost dried up and the water is too shallow, one may break his bones by jumping in. The conditioned soul is always experiencing miserable conditions. Sometimes his efforts to get help from friends are exactly like jumping into a dry river. By such actions, he does not derive any benefit. He only breaks his bones. Sometimes, suffering from a shortage of food, one may go to a person who is neither able to give charity nor willing to do so. Sometimes one is stationed in household life, which is compared to a forest fire (sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-d\u0101v\u0101nala-l\u012b\u1e0dha-loka). When a man is heavily taxed by the government, he becomes very sad. Heavy taxation obliges one to hide his income, but despite this endeavor the government agents are often so vigilant and strong that they take all the money anyway, and the conditioned soul becomes very aggrieved. Thus people are trying to become happy within the material world, but this is like trying to be happy in a forest fire. No one need go to a forest to set it ablaze: fire takes place automatically. Similarly, no one wants to be unhappy in family life or worldly life, but by the laws of nature unhappiness and distress are forced upon everyone. To become dependent on another\u2019s maintenance is very degrading; therefore, according to the Vedic system, everyone should live independently. Only the \u015b\u016bdras are unable to live independently. They are obliged to serve someone for maintenance. It is said in the \u015b\u0101stras: kalau \u015b\u016bdra-sambhav\u0101\u1e25. In this Age of Kali, everyone is dependent on another\u2019s mercy for the maintenance of the body; therefore everyone is classified as a \u015b\u016bdra. In the Twelfth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said that in Kali-yuga the government will levy taxes without reciprocally benefiting the citizens.

In this age there will also be a shortage of rain; therefore a scarcity of food will arise, and the citizens will be very much harassed by government taxation. In this way the citizens will abandon their attempts to lead a peaceful life and will leave their homes and hearths and go to the forest in sheer disappointment."

He then becomes very morose, and lamenting their loss, he sometimes becomes unconscious. Sometimes he imagines a great palatial city in which he desires to live happily with his family members and riches. He thinks himself fully satisfied if this is possible, but such so-called happiness continues only for a moment.",
        "purport": " The word gandharva-puram is very significant in this verse. Sometimes in the forest a very big castle appears, and this is called a castle in the air. Actually this castle does not exist anywhere but in one\u2019s imagination. This is called gandharva-pura. In the material forest, the conditioned soul sometimes contemplates great castles and skyscrapers, and he wastes his energy for such things, hoping to live in them very peacefully with his family forever. However, the laws of nature do not allow this. When he enters such castles, he temporarily thinks that he is very happy, even though his happiness is impermanent. His happiness may last for a few years, but because the owner of the castle has to leave the castle at the time of death, everything is eventually lost. This is the way of worldly transactions. Such happiness is described by Vidy\u0101pati as the happiness one derives upon seeing a drop of water in the desert. The desert is heated by scorching sunshine, and if we want to reduce the desert temperature, we need huge amounts of water \u2014 millions and millions of gallons. What effect will one drop have? Water certainly has value, but one drop of water cannot reduce the heat of the desert. In this material world everyone is ambitious, but the heat is very scorching. What will an imaginary castle in the air do to help? \u015ar\u012bla Vidy\u0101pati has therefore sung: t\u0101\u1e6dala saikate, v\u0101ri-bindu-sama, suta-mita-rama\u1e47i-sam\u0101je. The happiness of family life, friends and society is compared to a drop of water in the scorching desert. The entire material world is busy trying to attain happiness because happiness is the prerogative of the living being. Unfortunately, due to falling in contact with the material world, the living entity simply struggles for existence. Even if one becomes happy for a while, a very powerful enemy may plunder everything. There are many instances in which big businessmen suddenly become paupers in the street. Yet the nature of material existence is such that foolish people are attracted to these transactions and they forget the real business of self-realization."

        "translation": "Sometimes the merchant in the forest wants to climb the hills and mountains, but due to insufficient footwear, his feet are pricked by small stone fragments and by thorns on the mountain. Being pricked by them, he becomes very aggrieved. Sometimes a person who is very attached to his family becomes overwhelmed with hunger, and due to his miserable condition he becomes furious with his family members.",
        "purport": " The ambitious conditioned soul wants to be very happy in this material world with his family, but he is compared to a traveler in the forest who desires to climb a hill full of thorns and small stones. As stated in the previous verse, the happiness derived from society, friendship and love is like a drop of water in the scorching heat of the desert. One may want to become very great and powerful in society, but this is like attempting to climb a hill full of thorns. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura compares one\u2019s family to high mountains. Becoming happy in their association is like a hungry man\u2019s endeavoring to climb a mountain full of thorns. Almost 99.9 percent of the population is unhappy in family life, despite all the attempts being made to satisfy the family members. In the Western countries, due to the dissatisfaction of the family members, there is actually no family life. There are many cases of divorce, and out of dissatisfaction the children leave the protection of their parents. Especially in this Age of Kali, family life is being reduced. Everyone is becoming self-centered because that is the law of nature. Even if one has sufficient money to maintain a family, the situation is such that no one is happy in family life. Consequently according to the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution one has to retire from family life in middle age: pa\u00f1c\u0101\u015bordhva\u1e41 vana\u1e41 vrajet. One should voluntarily retire from family life at the age of fifty and go to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or a forest. This is recommended by \u015ar\u012bla Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja (Bh\u0101g. 7.5.5): There is no benefit in transferring from one forest to another. One must go to the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana forest and take shelter of Govinda. That will make one happy. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is therefore constructing a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-Balar\u0101ma temple to invite its members as well as outsiders to come and live peacefully in a spiritual atmosphere. That will help one become elevated to the transcendental world and return home, back to Godhead. Another sentence in this verse is very significant: kau\u1e6dumbika\u1e25 krudhyati vai jan\u0101ya. When one\u2019s mind is disturbed in so many ways, he satisfies himself by becoming angry with his poor wife and children. The wife and children are naturally dependent on the father, but the father, being unable to maintain the family properly, becomes mentally distressed and therefore chastises the family members unnecessarily. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.2.9): \u0101cchinna-d\u0101ra-dravi\u1e47\u0101 y\u0101syanti giri-k\u0101nanam. Being disgusted with family life, one separates from the family by divorce or some other means. If one has to separate, why not separate willingly? Systematic separation is better than forced separation. Forced separation cannot make anyone happy, but by mutual consent or by the Vedic arrangement one must separate from his family affairs at a certain age and fully depend on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This makes one\u2019s life successful."

At such a time he is left lying in the forest like a dead person, devoid of consciousness and knowledge. Sometimes other poisonous snakes bite him.

        "purport": " When one becomes unconscious due to being bitten by a snake, one cannot understand what is taking place outside the body. This unconscious condition is the condition of deep sleep. Similarly, the conditioned soul is actually sleeping on the lap of the illusory energy. Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has sung, kota nidr\u0101 y\u0101o m\u0101y\u0101-pi\u015b\u0101c\u012bra kole: \u201cO living entity, how long will you sleep in this condition on the lap of the illusory energy?\u201d People do not understand that they are actually sleeping in this material world, being devoid of knowledge of spiritual life. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore says: \u201cI have brought medicine to awaken every living being from perpetual sleep. Please receive the holy name of the Lord, the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, and awaken.\u201d The Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (1.3.14) also says, utti\u1e63\u1e6dha j\u0101grata pr\u0101pya var\u0101n nibodhata: \u201cO living entity, you are sleeping in this material world. Please get up and take advantage of your human form of life.\u201d The sleeping condition means loss of all knowledge. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.69) it is also said, y\u0101 ni\u015b\u0101 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 tasy\u0101\u1e41 j\u0101garti sa\u1e41yam\u012b: \u201cWhat is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled.\u201d Even in the higher planets, everyone is under the spell of the illusory energy. No one is really interested in the real values of life. The sleeping condition, called k\u0101la-sarpa (the time factor), keeps the conditioned soul in a state of ignorance, and therefore pure consciousness is lost. In the forest there are many blind wells, and if one falls down in one there is no chance of being rescued. In a state of sleep, one remains perpetually bitten by some animals, especially snakes."

In human society, those who are not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious remain in the forest of material life simply for the honey of sex life. Such debauchees are not at all satisfied with one wife. They want many women. Day after day, with great difficulty, they try to secure such women, and sometimes, while trying to taste this kind of honey, one is attacked by a woman\u2019s kinsmen and chastised very heavily. By bribing others, one may secure another woman for enjoyment, yet another debauchee may kidnap her or offer her something better. This woman hunting is going on in the forest of the material world, sometimes legally and sometimes illegally. Consequently in this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement the devotees are forbidden to have illicit sex. Thus they avoid so many difficulties. One should remain satisfied with one woman, being duly married. One can satisfy one\u2019s lusty desires with his wife without creating disturbances in society and being punished for doing so."

The four Kum\u0101ras walked everywhere in the guise of five-year-old boys, and similarly there are many br\u0101hma\u1e47as, knowers of Brahman, who traverse the globe either as young men, children or avadh\u016btas. Being puffed up due to their position, the royal dynasties generally offend these great personalities. Therefore King Rah\u016bga\u1e47a began to offer his respectful obeisances unto them so that the offensive royal dynasties might not glide down into a hellish condition. If one offends a great personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not excuse one, although the great personalities themselves might not take offense. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a was offended by Durv\u0101s\u0101, who even approached Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u for pardon.

        "translation": "King Par\u012bk\u1e63it then told \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b: My dear lord, O great devotee sage, you are omniscient. You have very nicely described the position of the conditioned soul, who is compared to a merchant in the forest. From these instructions intelligent men can understand that the senses of a person in the bodily conception are like rogues and thieves in that forest, and one\u2019s wife and children are like jackals and other ferocious animals. However, it is not very easy for the unintelligent to understand the purport of this story because it is difficult to extricate the exact meaning from the allegory. I therefore request Your Holiness to give the direct meaning.",
        "purport": " There are many stories and incidents in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that are described figuratively. Such allegorical descriptions may not be understood by unintelligent men; therefore it is the duty of the student to approach a bona fide spiritual master for the direct explanation."
