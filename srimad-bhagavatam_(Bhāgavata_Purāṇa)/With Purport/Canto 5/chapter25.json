He is the expansion of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u known as Lord Ananta or Lord Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. He is always in the transcendental position, but because He is worshiped by Lord \u015aiva, the deity of tamo-gu\u1e47a or darkness, He is sometimes called t\u0101mas\u012b. Lord Ananta is the predominating Deity of the material mode of ignorance as well as the false ego of all conditioned souls. When a conditioned living being thinks, \u201cI am the enjoyer, and this world is meant to be enjoyed by me,\u201d this conception of life is dictated to him by Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. Thus the mundane conditioned soul thinks himself the Supreme Lord.",
        "purport": " There is a class of men akin to M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers who misinterpret the aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi and so \u2019ham Vedic mantras to mean, \u201cI am the Supreme Brahman\u201d and \u201cI am identical with the Lord.\u201d This kind of false conception, in which one thinks himself the supreme enjoyer, is a kind of illusion. It is described elsewhere in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.8): janasya moho\u00a0\u2019yam aha\u1e41 mameti. As explained in the above verse, Lord Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a is the predominating Deity of this false conception. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): \u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\u201d The Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart as Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, and when a demon thinks himself one with the Supreme Lord, the Lord keeps him in that darkness. Although such a demoniac living entity is only an insignificant part of the Supreme Lord, he forgets his true position and thinks he is the Supreme Lord. Because this forgetfulness is created by Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, He is sometimes called t\u0101mas\u012b. The name t\u0101mas\u012b does not indicate that He has a material body. He is always transcendental, but because He is the Supersoul of Lord \u015aiva, who must perform tamasic activities, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a is sometimes called t\u0101mas\u012b."

        "translation": "Lord Ananta\u2019s arms are attractively long, beautifully decorated with bangles and completely spiritual. They are white, and so they appear like silver columns. When the beautiful princesses of the serpent kings, hoping for the Lord\u2019s auspicious blessing, smear His arms with aguru pulp, sandalwood pulp and ku\u1e45kuma, the touch of His limbs awakens lusty desires within them. Understanding their minds, the Lord looks at the princesses with a merciful smile, and they become bashful, realizing that He knows their desires. Then they smile beautifully and look upon the Lord\u2019s lotus face, which is beautified by reddish eyes rolling slightly from intoxication and delighted by love for His devotees.",
        "purport": " When males and females touch each other\u2019s bodies, their lusty desires naturally awaken. It appears from this verse that there are similar sensations in spiritual bodies. Both Lord Ananta and the women giving Him pleasure had spiritual bodies. Thus all sensations originally exist in the spiritual body. This is confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra: janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has commented in this connection that the word \u0101di means \u0101di-rasa, the original lusty feeling, which is born from the Supreme. However, spiritual lust and material lust are as completely different as gold and iron. Only one who is very highly elevated in spiritual realization can understand the lusty feelings exchanged between R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the damsels of Vraja. Therefore, unless one is very experienced and advanced in spiritual realization, he is forbidden to discuss the lusty feelings of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the gop\u012bs. However, if one is a sincere and pure devotee, the material lust in his heart is completely vanquished as he discusses the lusty feelings between the gop\u012bs and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he makes quick progress in spiritual life."

Because He is intoxicated, the Lord looks bewildered, and His eyes, appearing like flowers in full bloom, move to and fro. He pleases His personal associates, the heads of the demigods, by the sweet vibrations emanating from His mouth. Dressed in bluish garments and wearing a single earring, He holds a plow on His back with His two beautiful and well-constructed hands. Appearing as white as the heavenly King Indra, He wears a golden belt around His waist and a vaijayant\u012b garland of ever-fresh tulas\u012b blossoms around His neck.

N\u0101rada Muni, the son of Lord Brahm\u0101, always glorifies Anantadeva in his father\u2019s assembly. There he sings blissful verses of his own composition, accompanied by his stringed instrument [or a celestial singer] known as Tumburu.",
        "purport": " None of these descriptions of Lord Anantadeva are imaginary. They are all transcendentally blissful and full of actual knowledge. However, unless one hears them directly from a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession, one cannot understand them. This knowledge is delivered to N\u0101rada by Lord Brahm\u0101, and the great saint N\u0101rada, along with his companion, Tumburu, distributes it all over the universe. Sometimes the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as Uttama\u015bloka, one who is praised by beautiful poetry. N\u0101rada composes various poems to glorify Lord Ananta, and therefore the word sa\u1e41\u015blokay\u0101m \u0101sa (praised by selected poetry) is used in this verse. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas in the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya-samprad\u0101ya belong to the disciplic succession stemming from Lord Brahm\u0101. Lord Brahm\u0101 is the spiritual master of N\u0101rada, N\u0101rada is the spiritual master of Vy\u0101sadeva, and Vy\u0101sadeva wrote the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as a commentary on the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. Therefore all devotees in the Gau\u1e0d\u012byasamprad\u0101ya accept the activities of Lord Ananta related in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as authentic, and they are thus benefited by going back home, back to Godhead. The contamination in the heart of a conditioned soul is like a huge accumulation of garbage created by the three modes of material nature, especially the modes of rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance). This contamination becomes manifest in the form of lusty desires and greed for material possessions. As confirmed herein, unless one receives transcendental knowledge in disciplic succession, there is no question of his becoming purified of this contamination."

        "translation": "By His glance, the Supreme Personality of Godhead enables the modes of material nature to act as the causes of universal creation, maintenance and destruction. The Supreme Soul is unlimited and beginningless, and although He is one, He has manifested Himself in many forms. How can human society understand the ways of the Supreme?",
        "purport": " From Vedic literature we learn that when the Supreme Lord glances (sa aik\u1e63ata) over the material energy, the three modes of material nature become manifest and create material variety. Before He glances over the material energy, there is no possibility of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world. The Lord existed before the creation, and consequently He is eternal and unchanging. Therefore how can any human being, however great a scientist or philosopher he may be, understand the ways of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The following quotations from Caitanya-bh\u0101gavata (\u0100di-kha\u1e47\u1e0da, 1.48-52 and 1.58-69) tell of the glories of Lord Ananta: \u201cLord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, the four Kum\u0101ras [Sanaka, San\u0101tana, Sanandana and San\u0101t-kum\u0101ra], Vy\u0101sadeva, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and N\u0101rada are all pure devotees, eternal servants of the Lord. \u201cLord \u015ar\u012b Ananta is worshiped by all the uncontaminated devotees mentioned above. He has thousands of hoods and is the reservoir of all devotional service. \u201cLord Ananta is the original person and the great mystic controller. At the same time, He is a servant of God, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Since there is no end to His glories, no one can understand Him fully. \u201cI have already spoken to you of His service to the Lord. Now hear how the self-sufficient Anantadeva exists in the lower planetary system of P\u0101t\u0101la. \u201cBearing his stringed instrument, the tumburu, on his shoulders, the great sage N\u0101rada Muni always glorifies Lord Ananta. N\u0101rada Muni has composed many transcendental verses in praise of the Lord. \u201cSimply due to the glance of Lord Ananta, the three material modes of nature interact and produce creation, maintenance and annihilation. These modes of nature appear again and again. \u201cThe Lord is glorified as one without a second and as the supreme truth who has no beginning. Therefore He is called Anantadeva [unlimited]. Who can understand Him? \u201cHis form is completely spiritual, and He manifests it only by His mercy. All the activities in this material world are conducted only in His form. \u201cHe is very powerful and always prepared to please His personal associates and devotees. \u201cIf we simply try to engage in the congregational chanting of the glories of Lord Anantadeva, the dirty things in our hearts, accumulated during many births, will immediately be washed away. Therefore a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava never loses an opportunity to glorify Anantadeva. \u201cLord Anantadeva is known as \u015ae\u1e63a [the unlimited end] because He ends our passage through this material world. Simply by chanting His glories, everyone can be liberated. \u201cOn His head, Anantadeva sustains the entire universe, with its millions of planets containing enormous oceans and mountains. \u201cHe is so large and powerful that this universe rests on one of His hoods just like a drop of water. He does not know where it is. \u201cWhile bearing the universe on one of His hoods, Anantadeva chants the glories of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with each of His thousands of mouths. \u201cAlthough He has been chanting the glories of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a since time immemorial, He has still not come to their end. \u201cTo this very day, Lord Ananta continues to chant the glories of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, and still He finds no end to them.\u201d"
