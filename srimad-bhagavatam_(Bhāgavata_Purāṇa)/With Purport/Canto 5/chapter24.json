However to reconcile this apparent contradiction to the text of the Bh\u0101gavatam, Vijayadhvaja cites the following quotation concerning R\u0101hu; r\u0101hu-soma-rav\u012b\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 tu ma\u1e47\u1e0dal\u0101 dvi-gu\u1e47oktit\u0101m.

        "translation": "My dear King, now I shall describe to you the lower planetary systems, one by one, beginning from Atala. In Atala there is a demon, the son of Maya D\u0101nava named Bala, who created ninety-six kinds of mystic power. Some so-called yog\u012bs and sv\u0101m\u012bs take advantage of this mystic power to cheat people even today. Simply by yawning, the demon Bala created three kinds of women, known as svairi\u1e47\u012b, k\u0101mi\u1e47\u012b and pu\u1e41\u015bcal\u012b. The svairi\u1e47\u012bs like to marry men from their own group, the k\u0101mi\u1e47\u012bs marry men from any group, and the pu\u1e41\u015bcal\u012bs change husbands one after another. If a man enters the planet of Atala, these women immediately capture him and induce him to drink an intoxicating beverage made with a drug known as h\u0101\u1e6daka [cannabis indica]. This intoxicant endows the man with great sexual prowess, of which the women take advantage for enjoyment. A woman will enchant him with attractive glances, intimate words, smiles of love and then embraces. In this way she induces him to enjoy sex with her to her full satisfaction. Because of his increased sexual power, the man thinks himself stronger than ten thousand elephants and considers himself most perfect. Indeed, illusioned and intoxicated by false pride, he thinks himself God, ignoring impending death.",

Lord \u015aiva, as the progenitor, engages in sex with Bhav\u0101n\u012b, the progenitress, to produce living entities, and from the mixture of their vital fluid the river named H\u0101\u1e6dak\u012b is generated. When fire, being made to blaze by the wind, drinks of this river and then sizzles and spits it out, it produces gold called H\u0101\u1e6daka. The demons who live on that planet with their wives decorate themselves with various ornaments made from that gold, and thus they live there very happily.",
        "purport": " It appears that when Bhava and Bhav\u0101n\u012b, Lord \u015aiva and his wife, unite sexually, the emulsification of their secretions creates a chemical which when heated by fire can produce gold. It is said that the alchemists of the medieval age tried to prepare gold from base metal, and \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b also states that when bell metal is treated with mercury, it can produce gold. \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b mentions this in regard to the initiation of low-class men to turn them into br\u0101hma\u1e47as. San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b said: \u201cAs one can transform ka\u1e41sa, or bell metal, into gold by treating it with mercury, one can also turn a lowborn man into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by initiating him properly into Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava activities.\u201d The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is trying to turn mlecchas and yavanas into real br\u0101hma\u1e47as by properly initiating them and stopping them from engaging in meat-eating, intoxication, illicit sex and gambling. One who stops these four principles of sinful activity and chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra can certainly become a pure br\u0101hma\u1e47a through the process of bona fide initiation, as suggested by \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b. Apart from this, if one takes a hint from this verse and learns how to mix mercury with bell metal by properly heating and melting them, one can get gold very cheaply. The alchemists of the medieval age tried to manufacture gold, but they were unsuccessful, perhaps because they did not follow the right instructions."

For the welfare of Indra, the King of heaven, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u appeared in the form of a dwarf brahmac\u0101r\u012b as the son of Aditi and tricked Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja by begging for only three paces of land but taking all the three worlds. Being very pleased with Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja for giving all his possessions, the Lord returned his kingdom and made him richer than the opulent King Indra. Even now, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja engages in devotional service by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the planet of Sutala.",

However, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not become poor; by donating all his possessions to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he became a successful devotee and got everything back again with the blessings of the Lord. Similarly, those who give contributions to expand the activities of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement and to accomplish its objectives will never be losers; they will get their wealth back with the blessings of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. On the other side, those who collect contributions on behalf of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness should be very careful not to use even a farthing of the collection for any purpose other than the transcendental loving service of the Lord."

Karm\u012bs entangled in material activities face many difficulties in the practice of mystic yoga and other endeavors to achieve that same freedom.",
        "purport": " It is not a fact that one has to offer his material possessions to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and be liberated before he can engage in devotional service. A devotee automatically attains liberation without separate endeavors. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not get back all his material possessions merely because of his charity to the Lord. One who becomes a devotee, free from material desires and motives, regards all opportunities, both material and spiritual, as benedictions from the Lord, and in this way his service to the Lord is never hampered. Bhukti, material enjoyment, and mukti, liberation, are only by-products of devotional service. A devotee need not work separately to attain mukti. \u015ar\u012bla Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura said, mukti\u1e25 svaya\u1e41 mukulit\u0101\u00f1jali\u1e25 sevate\u00a0\u2019sm\u0101n: a pure devotee of the Lord does not have to endeavor separately for mukti, because mukti is always ready to serve him. In this regard, Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Antya 3.177-188) describes Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura\u2019s confirmation of the effect of chanting the holy name of the Lord. Some say that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one is freed from all the reactions of sinful life, and others say that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one attains liberation from material bondage. Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, however, said that the desired result of chanting the holy name of the Lord is not that one is liberated from material bondage or freed from the reactions of sinful life. The actual result of chanting the holy name of the Lord is that one awakens his dormant K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his loving service to the Lord. Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura said that liberation and freedom from the reactions of sinful activities are only by-products of chanting the holy name of the Lord. If one chants the holy name of the Lord purely, he attains the platform of loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura gave an example comparing the power of the holy name to sunshine. He placed a verse before all the learned scholars present, but the learned scholars asked him to state the purport of the verse. Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura said that as the sun begins to rise, it dissipates the darkness of night, even before the sunshine is visible. Before the sunrise even takes place, the light of dawn destroys the fear of the dangers of the night, such as disturbances by thieves, ghosts and R\u0101k\u1e63asas, and when the sunshine actually appears, one engages in his duties. Similarly, even before one\u2019s chanting of the holy name is pure, one is freed from all sinful reactions, and when he chants purely he becomes a lover of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A devotee never accepts mukti, even if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a offers it. Mukti, freedom from all sinful reactions, is obtained even by n\u0101m\u0101bh\u0101sa, or a glimpse of the light of the holy name before its full light is perfectly visible. The n\u0101m\u0101bh\u0101sa stage is between that of n\u0101ma-apar\u0101dha, or chanting of the holy name with offenses, and pure chanting. There are three stages in chanting the holy name of the Lord. In the first stage, one commits ten kinds of offenses while chanting. In the next stage, n\u0101m\u0101bh\u0101sa, the offenses have almost stopped, and one is coming to the platform of pure chanting. In the third stage, when one chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra without offenses, his dormant love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately awakens. This is the perfection."

The result of material opulence is that one can no longer absorb his mind in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " There are two kinds of opulence. One, which results from one\u2019s karma, is material, whereas the other is spiritual. A surrendered soul who fully depends upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not want material opulence for sense gratification. Therefore when a pure devotee is seen to possess exalted material opulence, it is not due to his karma. Rather, it is due to his bhakti. In other words, he is in that position because the Supreme Lord wants him to execute service to Him very easily and opulently. The special mercy of the Lord for the neophyte devotee is that he becomes materially poor. This is the Lord\u2019s mercy because if a neophyte devotee becomes materially opulent, he forgets the service of the Lord. However, if an advanced devotee is favored by the Lord with opulence, it is not material opulence but a spiritual opportunity. Material opulence offered to the demigods causes forgetfulness of the Lord, but opulence was given to Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja for continuing service to the Lord, which was free from any touch of m\u0101y\u0101."

Indra was certainly very advanced in knowledge, but instead of asking V\u0101manadeva for engagement in His service, he used the Lord to beg for material possessions that would be finished at the end of one age of Manu. An age of Manu, which is the duration of Manu\u2019s life, is calculated to last seventy-two yugas. One yuga consists of 4,300,000 years, and therefore the duration of Manu\u2019s life is 309,600,000 years. The demigods possess their material opulence only until the end of the life of Manu. Time is insurmountable. The time one is allotted, even if it be millions of years, is quickly gone. The demigods own their material possessions only within the limits of time. Therefore Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja lamented that although Indra was very learned, he did not know how to use his intelligence properly, for instead of asking V\u0101manadeva to allow him to engage in His service, Indra used Him to beg Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja for material wealth. Although Indra was learned and his prime minister, B\u1e5bhaspati, was also learned, neither of them begged to be able to render loving service to Lord V\u0101manadeva.

The path of bhakti is not at all difficult if we follow in the footsteps of previous \u0101c\u0101ryas and authorities, but those who are too materially contaminated by the modes of material nature cannot follow them. Although Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was actually following the path of his grandfather, because of his great humility he thought that he was not. It is characteristic of advanced Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas following the principles of bhakti that they think themselves ordinary human beings. This is not an artificial exhibition of humility; a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sincerely thinks this way and therefore never admits his exalted position."
