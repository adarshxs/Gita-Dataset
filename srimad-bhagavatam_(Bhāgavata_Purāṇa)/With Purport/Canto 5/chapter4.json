This son was equal to everyone and very peaceful. He could control His senses and His mind, and, possessing all opulence, He did not hanker for material enjoyment.

        "purport": " In these days of cheap incarnations, it is very interesting to note the bodily symptoms found in an incarnation. From the very beginning of His birth, it was observed that \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva\u2019s feet were marked with the transcendental signs (a flag, thunderbolt, lotus flower, etc.). In addition to this, as the Lord began to grow He became very prominent. He was equal to everyone. He did not favor one person and neglect another. An incarnation of God must have the six opulences \u2014 wealth, strength, knowledge, beauty, fame and renunciation. It is said that although \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva was endowed with all opulences, He was not at all attached to material enjoyment. He was self-controlled and therefore liked by everyone. Due to His superexcellent qualities, everyone wanted Him to rule the earth. An incarnation of God has to be accepted by experienced people and by the symptoms described in the \u015b\u0101stras. An incarnation is not accepted simply by the adulation of foolish people."

Consequently he stopped pouring water on the planet known as Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a. At that time the Supreme Lord, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, the master of all mystic power, understood King Indra\u2019s purpose and smiled a little. Then, by His own prowess, through yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 [His internal potency], He profusely poured water upon His own place, which was known as Ajan\u0101bha.",
        "purport": " We find the word bhagav\u0101n used twice in this verse. Both King Indra and \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, are described as bhagav\u0101n. Sometimes N\u0101rada and Lord Brahm\u0101 are also addressed as bhagav\u0101n. The word bhagav\u0101n means that one is a very opulent and powerful person like Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, N\u0101rada or Indra. They are all addressed as bhagav\u0101n due to their extraordinary opulence. King \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord, and therefore He was the original Bhagav\u0101n. Consequently He is described herein as yoge\u015bvara, which indicates that He has the most powerful spiritual potency. He is not dependent on King Indra for water. He can supply water Himself, and He did so in this case. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated: yaj\u00f1\u0101d bhavati parjanya\u1e25. Due to the performance of yaj\u00f1a, clouds of water are manifest in the sky. Clouds and rainfall are under the management of Indra, the heavenly King, but when Indra is neglectful, the Supreme Lord Himself, who is also known as yaj\u00f1a or yaj\u00f1a-pati, takes the task upon Himself. Consequently there was sufficient rainfall in the place named Ajan\u0101bha. When yaj\u00f1a-pati wants to, He can do anything without the help of any subordinate. Therefore the Supreme Lord is known as almighty. In the present Age of Kali there will eventually be a great scarcity of water (an\u0101v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di), for the general populace, due to ignorance and the scarcity of yaj\u00f1ic ingredients, will neglect to perform yaj\u00f1as. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam therefore advises: yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yai\u1e25 yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25. After all, yaj\u00f1a is meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this Age of Kali, there is great scarcity and ignorance; nonetheless, everyone can perform sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. Every family in every society can conduct sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a at least every evening. In this way there will be no disturbance or scarcity of rain. It is essential for the people in this age to perform the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a in order to be materially happy and to advance spiritually."

It was with ecstasy and a faltering voice that he addressed Him, \u201cMy dear son, my darling.\u201d This mentality was brought about by yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, whereby he accepted the Supreme Lord, the supreme father, as his own son. Out of His supreme good will, the Lord became his son and dealt with everyone as if He were an ordinary human being. Thus King N\u0101bhi began to raise his transcendental son with great affection, and he was overwhelmed with transcendental bliss, joy and devotion.",
        "purport": " The word m\u0101y\u0101 is used in the sense of illusion. Considering the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be his own son, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi was certainly in illusion, but this was transcendental illusion. This illusion is required; otherwise how can one accept the supreme father as his own son? The Supreme Lord appears as the son of one of His devotees, just as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared as the son of Ya\u015bod\u0101 and Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. These devotees could never think of their son as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for such appreciation would hamper their relationship of parental love."

        "translation": "King N\u0101bhi understood that his son, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, was very popular among the citizens and among government officers and ministers. Understanding the popularity of his son, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi enthroned Him as the emperor of the world to give protection to the general populace in terms of the Vedic religious system. To do this, he entrusted Him into the hands of learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who would guide Him in administrating the government. Then Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi and his wife, Merudev\u012b, went to Badarik\u0101\u015brama in the Him\u0101laya Mountains, where the King engaged Himself very expertly in austerities and penances with great jubilation. In full sam\u0101dhi he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His plenary expansion. By doing so, in course of time Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi was elevated to the spiritual world known as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha.",
        "purport": " When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi saw that his son \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva was popular with the general populace and the governmental servants, he chose to install Him on the imperial throne. In addition, he wanted to entrust his son into the hands of the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as. This means that a monarch was supposed to govern strictly according to Vedic principles under the guidance of learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who could advise Him according to the standard Vedic scriptures like Manu-sm\u1e5bti and similar \u015b\u0101stras. It is the duty of the king to rule the citizens according to Vedic principles. According to Vedic principles, society is divided into four categories \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra. C\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25. After dividing society in this way, it is the king\u2019s duty to see that everyone executes Vedic principles according to his caste. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a must perform the duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a without cheating the public. It is not that one attains the name of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a without the qualifications. It is the king\u2019s duty to see that everyone engages in his occupational duty according to Vedic principles. In addition, retirement at the end of life is compulsory. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi, although still a king, retired from family life and went with his wife to a place called Badarik\u0101\u015brama in the Him\u0101layas, where the Deity Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is worshiped. The words prasanna-nipu\u1e47ena tapas\u0101 indicate that the King accepted all kinds of austerity very expertly and jubilantly. He did not at all mind leaving his comfortable life at home, although he was the emperor. Despite undergoing severe austerities and penances, he felt very pleased at Badarik\u0101\u015brama, and he did everything there expertly. In this way, being fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness (sam\u0101dhi-yoga), always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi attained success at the end of his life and was promoted to the spiritual world, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. This is the way of Vedic life. One must stop the process of repeated birth and death and return home, back to Godhead. The words tan-mahim\u0101nam av\u0101pa are significant in this regard. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b says that mahim\u0101 means liberation in this life. We should act in such a way in this life that after giving up this body, we will become liberated from the bondage of repeated birth and death. This is called j\u012bvan-mukti. \u015ar\u012bla V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya states that in the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad there are eight symptoms of a j\u012bvan-mukta, a person who is already liberated even when living in this body. The first symptom of one so liberated is that he is freed from all sinful activity (apahata-p\u0101pa). As long as one is under the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 in the material energy, one has to engage in sinful activity. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 describes such people as du\u1e63k\u1e5btina\u1e25, which indicates that they are always engaged in sinful activity. One who is liberated in this life does not commit any sinful activities. Sinful activity involves illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Another symptom of a liberated person is vijara, which indicates that he is not subjected to the miseries of old age. Another symptom is vim\u1e5btyu. A liberated person prepares himself in such a way that he does not take on any more material bodies, which are destined to die. In other words, he does not fall down again to repeat birth and death. Another symptom is vi\u015boka, which indicates that he is callous to material distress and happiness. Another is vijighatsa, which indicates that he no longer desires material enjoyment. Another symptom is apip\u0101t\u0101, which means that he has no desire other than to engage in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his dearmost pursuable Lord. A further symptom is satya-k\u0101ma, which indicates that all his desires are directed to the Supreme Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He does not want anything else. He is satya-sa\u1e45kalpa. Whatever he desires is fulfilled by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. First of all, he does not desire anything for his material benefit, and secondly if he desires anything at all, he simply desires to serve the Supreme Lord. That desire is fulfilled by the Lord\u2019s grace. That is called satya-sa\u1e45kalpa. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b points out that the word mahim\u0101 means returning to the spiritual world, back home, back to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva says that the word mahim\u0101 means that the devotee attains the qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called sadharma, or \u201cthe same quality.\u201d Just as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is never born and never dies, His devotees who return to Godhead never die and never take birth within the material world."

Unless one is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he cannot call forth the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord does not accept an invitation unless one is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava.

They were competent in the performance of the Vedic rituals, and over and above this they were Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas.

These are the two functions of the Supreme Lord when He incarnates. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has said that in order to preach one must live a practical life and show people how to do things. \u0100pani \u0101cari\u2019 bhakti \u015bikh\u0101imu sab\u0101re.

Although \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva had nothing to learn from gurukula, He went there just to teach the people in general how to take an education from the right source, from Vedic teachers. He then entered householder life and lived according to the principles of Vedic knowledge \u2014 \u015bruti and sm\u1e5bti. In his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.101) \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, quoting the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a, states: Human society must follow the instructions received from \u015bruti and sm\u1e5bti, Vedic literature. Practically applied in life this is worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi. Every human being must advance his spiritual life and at the end return home, back to Godhead. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva strictly followed all these principles.

He was always equipoised, and He saw everyone on the same level. He was unhappy to see others unhappy, and He was the well-wisher of all living entities. Although He was a perfect personality, the Supreme Lord and controller of all, He nonetheless acted as if He were an ordinary conditioned soul. Therefore He strictly followed the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma and acted accordingly. In due course of time, the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma had become neglected; therefore through His personal characteristics and behavior, He taught the ignorant public how to perform duties within the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. In this way He regulated the general populace in householder life, enabling them to develop religion and economic well-being and to attain reputations, sons and daughters, material pleasure and finally eternal life.

The material world is described by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself as du\u1e25kh\u0101layam a\u015b\u0101\u015bvatam, a temporary place of misery. No one can stay here, even if he makes a compromise with misery. One has to give up this body and accept another, which may not even be a human body. As soon as one gets a material body, he becomes deha-bh\u1e5bt, or deh\u012b. In other words, he is subjected to all the material conditions. The leaders of society must be so ideal that by following them one can be relieved from the clutches of material existence."
