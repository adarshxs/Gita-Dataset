        "translation": "Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva told His sons: My dear boys, of all the living entities who have accepted material bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should not work hard day and night simply for sense gratification, which is available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool. One should engage in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service. By such activity, one\u2019s heart is purified, and when one attains this position, he attains eternal, blissful life, which is transcendental to material happiness and which continues forever.",
        "purport": " In this verse Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva tells His sons about the importance of human life. The word deha-bh\u0101k refers to anyone who accepts a material body, but the living entity who is awarded the human form must act differently from animals. Animals like dogs and hogs enjoy sense gratification by eating stool. After undergoing severe hardships all day, human beings are trying to enjoy themselves at night by eating, drinking, having sex and sleeping. At the same time, they have to properly defend themselves. However, this is not human civilization. Human life means voluntarily practicing suffering for the advancement of spiritual life. There is, of course, suffering in the lives of animals and plants, which are suffering due to their past misdeeds. However, human beings should voluntarily accept suffering in the form of austerities and penances in order to attain the divine life. After attaining the divine life, one can enjoy happiness eternally. After all, every living entity is trying to enjoy happiness, but as long as one is encaged in the material body he has to suffer different kinds of misery. A higher sense is present in the human form. We should act according to superior advice in order to attain eternal happiness and go back to Godhead. It is significant in this verse that the government and the natural guardian, the father, should educate subordinates and raise them to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Devoid of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, every living being suffers in this cycle of birth and death perpetually. To relieve them from this bondage and enable them to become blissful and happy, bhakti-yoga should be taught. A foolish civilization neglects to teach people how to rise to the platform of bhakti-yoga. Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness a person is no better than a hog or dog. The instructions of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva are very essential at the present moment. People are being educated and trained to work very hard for sense gratification, and there is no sublime aim in life. A man travels to earn his livelihood, leaving home early in the morning, catching a local train and being packed in a compartment. He has to stand for an hour or two in order to reach his place of business. Then again he takes a bus to get to the office. At the office he works hard from nine to five; then he takes two or three hours to return home. After eating, he has sex and goes to sleep. For all this hardship, his only happiness is a little sex. Yan maithun\u0101di-g\u1e5bhamedhi-sukha\u1e41 hi tuccham. \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva clearly states that human life is not meant for this kind of existence, which is enjoyed even by dogs and hogs. Indeed, dogs and hogs do not have to work so hard for sex. A human being should try to live in a different way and should not try to imitate dogs and hogs. The alternative is mentioned. Human life is meant for tapasya, austerity and penance. By tapasya, one can get out of the material clutches. When one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional service, his happiness is guaranteed eternally. By taking to bhakti-yoga, devotional service, one\u2019s existence is purified. The living entity is seeking happiness life after life, but he can make a solution to all his problems simply by practicing bhakti-yoga. Then he immediately becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d"

Whether one wants to merge into the Lord\u2019s existence or wants to associate with the Personality of Godhead, one should render service to the mah\u0101tm\u0101s. For those who are not interested in such activities, who associate with people fond of women and sex, the path to hell is wide open. The mah\u0101tm\u0101s are equipoised. They do not see any difference between one living entity and another. They are very peaceful and are fully engaged in devotional service. They are devoid of anger, and they work for the benefit of everyone. They do not behave in any abominable way. Such people are known as mah\u0101tm\u0101s.",
        "purport": " The human body is like a junction. One may either take the path of liberation or the path leading to a hellish condition. How one can take these paths is described herein. On the path of liberation, one associates with mah\u0101tm\u0101s, and on the path of bondage one associates with those attached to sense gratification and women. There are two types of mah\u0101tm\u0101s \u2014 the impersonalist and the devotee. Although their ultimate goal is different, the process of emancipation is almost the same. Both want eternal happiness. One seeks happiness in impersonal Brahman, and the other seeks happiness in the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As described in the first verse: brahma-saukhyam. Brahman means spiritual or eternal; both the impersonalist and the devotee seek eternal blissful life. In any case, it is advised that one become perfect. In the words of Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.87): To remain unattached to the modes of material nature, one should avoid associating with those who are asat, materialistic. There are two kinds of materialists. One is attached to women and sense gratification, and the other is simply a nondevotee. On the positive side is association with mah\u0101tm\u0101s, and on the negative side is the avoidance of nondevotees and women-hunters."

As long as the mind is impure, consciousness is unclear, and as long as one is absorbed in fruitive activity, he has to accept a material body.",
        "purport": " Generally people think that one should act very piously in order to be relieved from misery, but this is not a fact. Even though one engages in pious activity and speculation, he is nonetheless defeated. His only aim should be emancipation from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 and all material activities. Speculative knowledge and pious activity do not solve the problems of material life. One should be inquisitive to understand his spiritual position. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.37): \u201cAs a blazing fire turns firewood to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge burn to ashes all reactions to material activities.\u201d Unless one understands the self and its activities, one has to be considered in material bondage. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.2.32) it is also said: ye\u00a0\u2019nye\u00a0\u2019ravind\u0101k\u1e63a vimukta-m\u0101ninas tvayy asta-bh\u0101v\u0101d avi\u015buddha-buddhaya\u1e25.

As long as one is interested in karma and j\u00f1\u0101na, he continues enduring the miseries of material life \u2014 birth, old age, disease and death. Karm\u012bs certainly take on one body after another. As far as j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are concerned, unless they are promoted to the topmost understanding, they must return to the material world. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19): bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate. The point is to know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, as everything and surrender unto Him. Karm\u012bs do not know this, but a devotee who is one hundred percent engaged in the devotional service of the Lord knows fully what is karma and j\u00f1\u0101na; therefore a pure devotee is no longer interested in karma or j\u00f1\u0101na.

        "purport": " When the mind is polluted by fruitive activity, the living entity wants to be elevated from one material position to another. Generally everyone is involved in working hard day and night to improve his economic condition. Even when one understands the Vedic rituals, he becomes interested in promotion to heavenly planets, not knowing that one\u2019s real interest lies in returning home, back to Godhead. By acting on the platform of fruitive activity, one wanders throughout the universe in different species and forms. Unless he comes in contact with a devotee of the Lord, a guru, he does not become attached to the service of Lord V\u0101sudeva. Knowledge of V\u0101sudeva requires many births to understand. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19): v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25. After struggling for existence for many births one may take shelter at the lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When this happens, one actually becomes wise and surrenders unto Him. That is the only way to stop the repetition of birth and death. This is confirmed in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 19.151) in the instructions given by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu to \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b at Da\u015b\u0101\u015bvamedha-gh\u0101\u1e6da. The living entity wanders throughout different planets in different forms and bodies, but if by chance he comes in contact with a bona fide spiritual master, by the grace of the spiritual master he receives Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s shelter, and his devotional life begins."

In any case, the man always thinks of the woman, and the woman always thinks of the man. Thus a person becomes materially attached to family, property and children, although all of these are temporary. The possessor unfortunately identifies with his property and wealth. Sometimes, even after renunciation, one becomes attached to a temple or to the few things that constitute the property of a sanny\u0101s\u012b, but such attachment is not as strong as family attachment. The attachment to the family is the strongest illusion. In the Satya-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, it is stated: Sometimes it is found among exalted personalities like Lord Brahm\u0101 that the wife and children are not a cause of bondage. On the contrary, the wife actually helps further spiritual life and liberation. Nonetheless, most people are bound by the knots of the marital relationship, and consequently they forget their relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "translation": "O My sons, you should accept a highly elevated paramaha\u1e41sa, a spiritually advanced spiritual master. In this way, you should place your faith and love in Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You should detest sense gratification and tolerate the duality of pleasure and pain, which are like the seasonal changes of summer and winter. Try to realize the miserable condition of living entities, who are miserable even in the higher planetary systems. Philosophically inquire about the truth. Then undergo all kinds of austerities and penances for the sake of devotional service. Give up the endeavor for sense enjoyment and engage in the service of the Lord. Listen to discussions about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and always associate with devotees. Chant about and glorify the Supreme Lord, and look upon everyone equally on the spiritual platform. Give up enmity and subdue anger and lamentation. Abandon identifying the self with the body and the home, and practice reading the revealed scriptures. Live in a secluded place and practice the process by which you can completely control your life air, mind and senses. Have full faith in the revealed scriptures, the Vedic literatures, and always observe celibacy. Perform your prescribed duties and avoid unnecessary talks. Always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, acquire knowledge from the right source. Thus practicing bhakti-yoga, you will patiently and enthusiastically be elevated in knowledge and will be able to give up the false ego.",
        "purport": " In these four verses, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva tells His sons how they can be freed from the false identification arising from false ego and material conditional life. One gradually becomes liberated by practicing as mentioned above. All these prescribed methods enable one to give up the material body (li\u1e45ga\u1e41 vyapohet) and be situated in his original spiritual body. First of all one has to accept a bona fide spiritual master. This is advocated by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu: \u015br\u012b-guru-p\u0101d\u0101\u015braya\u1e25. To be freed from the entanglement of the material world, one has to approach a spiritual master. Tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet. By questioning the spiritual master and by serving him, one can advance in spiritual life. When one engages in devotional service, naturally the attraction for personal comfort \u2014 for eating, sleeping and dressing \u2014 is reduced. By associating with the devotee, a spiritual standard is maintained. The word mad-deva-sa\u1e45g\u0101t is very important. There are many so-called religions devoted to the worship of various demigods, but here good association means association with one who simply accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his worshipable Deity. Another important item is dvandva-titik\u1e63\u0101. As long as one is situated in the material world, there must be pleasure and pain arising from the material body. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, t\u0101\u1e41s titik\u1e63asva bh\u0101rata. One has to learn how to tolerate the temporary pains and pleasures of this material world. One must also be detached from his family and practice celibacy. Sex with one\u2019s wife according to the scriptural injunctions is also accepted as brahmacarya (celibacy), but illicit sex is opposed to religious principles, and it hampers advancement in spiritual consciousness. Another important word is vij\u00f1\u0101na-vir\u0101jita. Everything should be done very scientifically and consciously. One should be a realized soul. In this way, one can give up the entanglement of material bondage. As \u015ar\u012b Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya points out, the sum and substance of these four \u015blokas is that one should refrain from acting out of a desire for sense gratification and should instead always engage in the Lord\u2019s loving service. In other words, bhakti-yoga is the acknowledged path of liberation. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya quotes from the Adhy\u0101tma: One should perform activities only for the benefit of the soul; any other activity should be given up. When a person is situated in this way, he is said to be desireless. Actually a living entity cannot be totally desireless, but when he desires the benefit of the soul and nothing else, he is said to be desireless. Spiritual knowledge is j\u00f1\u0101na-vij\u00f1\u0101na-samanvitam. When one is fully equipped with j\u00f1\u0101na and vij\u00f1\u0101na, he is perfect. J\u00f1\u0101na means that one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, to be the Supreme Being. Vij\u00f1\u0101na refers to the activities that liberate one from the ignorance of material existence. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.9.31): j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 parama-guhya\u1e41 me yad vij\u00f1\u0101na-samanvitam. Knowledge of the Supreme Lord is very confidential, and the supreme knowledge by which one understands Him furthers the liberation of all living entities. This knowledge is vij\u00f1\u0101na. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d"

By these means you will be freed from the ignorance of the desire for fruitive activity, and the knot of bondage in the heart will be completely severed. For further advancement, you should also give up the means. That is, you should not become attached to the process of liberation itself.",
        "purport": " The process of liberation is brahma jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101, the search for the Absolute Truth. Generally brahma jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101 is called neti neti, the process by which one analyzes existence to search out the Absolute Truth. This method continues as long as one is not situated in his spiritual life. Spiritual life is brahma-bh\u016bta, the self-realized state. In the words of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): \u201cOne who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state, he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\u201d The idea is to enter into the par\u0101 bhakti, the transcendental devotional service of the Supreme Lord. To attain this, one must analyze ones existence, but when one is actually engaged in devotional service he should not bother seeking out knowledge. By simply engaging in devotional service undeviatingly, one will always remain in the liberated condition. The unflinching execution of devotional service is in itself brahma-bh\u016bta. Another important feature in this connection is anena yogena yathopade\u015bam. The instructions received from the spiritual master must be followed immediately. One should not deviate from or surpass the instructions of the spiritual master. One should not be simply intent on consulting books but should simultaneously execute the spiritual master\u2019s order (yathopade\u015bam). Mystic power should be achieved to enable one to give up the material conception, but when one actually engages in devotional service, one does not need to practice the mystic yoga system. The point is that one can give up the practice of yoga, but devotional service cannot be given up. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.7.10): Even those who are liberated (\u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma) must always engage in devotional service. One may give up the practice of yoga when one is self-realized, but at no stage can one give up devotional service. All other activities for self-realization, including yoga and philosophical speculation, may be given up, but devotional service must be retained at all times."

        "translation": "One who cannot deliver his dependents from the path of repeated birth and death should never become a spiritual master, a father, a husband, a mother or a worshipable demigod.",
        "purport": " There are many spiritual masters, but \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva advises that one should not become a spiritual master if he is unable to save his disciple from the path of birth and death. Unless one is a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he cannot save himself from the path of repeated birth and death. Tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so \u2019rjuna. One can stop birth and death only by returning home, back to Godhead. However, who can go back to Godhead unless he understands the Supreme Lord in truth? Janma karma ca me divyam eva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25. We have many instances in history illustrating \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva\u2019s instructions. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya was rejected by Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja due to his inability to save Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja from the path of repeated birth and death. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya was not a pure devotee, he was more or less inclined to fruitive activity, and he objected when Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja promised to give everything to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Actually one is supposed to give everything to the Lord because everything belongs to the Lord. Consequently, the Supreme Lord advises in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.27): \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.\u201d This is bhakti. Unless one is devoted, he cannot give everything to the Supreme Lord. Unless one can do so, he cannot become a spiritual master, husband, father or mother. Similarly, the wives of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who were performing sacrifices gave up their relatives just to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is an example of a wife rejecting a husband who cannot deliver her from the impending dangers of birth and death. Similarly, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja rejected his father, and Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja rejected his mother (janan\u012b na s\u0101 sy\u0101t). The word daivam indicates a demigod or one who accepts worship from a dependent. Ordinarily, the spiritual master, husband, father, mother or superior relative accepts worship from an inferior relative, but here \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva forbids this. First the father, spiritual master or husband must be able to release the dependent from repeated birth and death. If he cannot do this, he plunges himself into the ocean of reproachment for his unlawful activities. Everyone should be very responsible and take charge of his dependents just as a spiritual master takes charge of his disciple or a father takes charge of his son. All these responsibilities cannot be discharged honestly unless one can save the dependent from repeated birth and death."

        "translation": "My transcendental body [sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha] looks exactly like a human form, but it is not a material human body. It is inconceivable. I am not forced by nature to accept a particular type of body; I take on a body by My own sweet will. My heart is also spiritual, and I always think of the welfare of My devotees. Therefore within My heart can be found the process of devotional service, which is meant for the devotees. Far from My heart have I abandoned irreligion [adharma] and nondevotional activities. They do not appeal to Me. Due to all these transcendental qualities, people generally pray to Me as \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the best of all living entities.",
        "purport": " In this verse the words ida\u1e41 \u015bar\u012bra\u1e41 mama durvibh\u0101vyam are very significant. Generally we experience two energies \u2014 material energy and spiritual energy. We have some experience of the material energy (earth, water, air, fire, ether, mind, intelligence and ego) because in the material world everyone\u2019s body is composed of these elements. Within the material body is the spirit soul, but we cannot see it with the material eyes. When we see a body full of spiritual energy, it is very difficult for us to understand how the spiritual energy can have a body. It is said that Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva\u2019s body is completely spiritual; therefore for a materialistic person, it is very difficult to understand. For a materialistic person, the completely spiritual body is inconceivable. We have to accept the version of the Vedas when our experimental perception cannot understand a subject. As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25. The Supreme Lord has a body with form, but that body is not composed of material elements. It is made of spiritual bliss, eternity and living force. By the inconceivable energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord can appear before us in His original spiritual body, but because we have no experience of the spiritual body, we are sometimes bewildered and see the form of the Lord as material. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers are completely unable to conceive of a spiritual body. They say that the spirit is always impersonal, and whenever they see something personal they take it for granted that it is material. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11) it is said: \u201cFools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.\u201d Unintelligent people think that the Supreme Lord accepts a body composed of the material energy. We can easily understand the material body, but we cannot understand the spiritual body. Therefore \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva says: ida\u1e41 \u015bar\u012bra\u1e41 mama durvibh\u0101vyam. In the spiritual world, everyone has a spiritual body. There is no conception of material existence there. In the spiritual world there is only service and the receiving of service. There is only sevya, sev\u0101 and sevaka \u2014 the person served, the process of service and the servant. These three items are completely spiritual, and therefore the spiritual world is called absolute. There is no tinge of material contamination there. Being completely transcendental to the material conception, Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva states that His heart is composed of dharma. Dharma is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. In the spiritual world, every living entity is surrendered to the Supreme Lord and is completely on the spiritual platform. Although there are servitors, the served and service, all are spiritual and variegated. At the present moment, due to our material conception, everything is durvibh\u0101vya, inconceivable. Being the Supreme, the Lord is called \u1e5a\u1e63abha, the best. In terms of the Vedic language, nityo nity\u0101n\u0101m. We are also spiritual. but we are subordinate. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord, is the foremost living entity. The word \u1e5b\u1e63abha means \u201cthe chief,\u201d or \u201cthe supreme,\u201d and indicates the Supreme Being, or God Himself."

You should accept your eldest brother, Bharata, who is exalted in devotional service. If you engage yourselves in Bharata\u2019s service, your service to him will include My service, and you will rule the citizens automatically.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word h\u1e5bdaya indicates the heart, which is also called ura\u1e25, the chest. The heart is situated within the chest, and although instrumentally the son is born with the aid of the genitals, he is actually born from within the heart. According to the heart\u2019s situation, the semen takes the form of a body. Therefore according to the Vedic system, when one begets a child his heart should be purified through the ritualistic ceremony known as garbh\u0101dh\u0101na. \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva\u2019s heart was always uncontaminated and spiritual. Consequently all the sons born from the heart of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva were spiritually inclined. Nonetheless, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva suggested that His eldest son was superior, and He advised the others to serve him. All the brothers of Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja were advised by \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva to adhere to Bharata\u2019s service. The question may be asked why one should be attached to family members, for in the beginning it was advised that one should not be attached to home and family. However, it is also advised, mah\u012byas\u0101m p\u0101da-rajo-\u2019bhi\u1e63eka \u2014 one has to serve the mah\u012by\u0101n, one who is very spiritually advanced. Mahat-sev\u0101\u1e41 dv\u0101ram \u0101hur vimukte\u1e25: by serving the mahat, the exalted devotee, one\u2019s path for liberation is open. The family of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva should not be compared to an ordinary materialistic family. Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva\u2019s eldest son, was specifically very exalted. For this reason the other sons were advised to serve him for his pleasure. That was to be their duty. The Supreme Lord was advising Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to be the chief ruler of the planet. This is the real plan of the Supreme Lord. In the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, we find that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to be the supreme emperor of this planet. He never wanted Duryodhana to take the post. As stated in the previous verse, Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva\u2019s heart is h\u1e5bdaya\u1e41 yatra dharma\u1e25. The characteristic dharma is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To protect dharma (paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101m), the Lord always wants the ruler of the earth to be a devotee. Then everything goes on nicely for the benefit of everyone. As soon as a demon rules the earth, everything becomes chaotic. At the present moment, the world is inclined toward the democratic process, but the people in general are all contaminated by the modes of passion and ignorance. Consequently they cannot select the right person to head the government. The president is selected by the votes of ignorant \u015b\u016bdras; therefore another \u015b\u016bdra is elected, and immediately the entire government becomes polluted. If people strictly followed the principles of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, they would elect a person who is the Lord\u2019s devotee. Then automatically there would be good government. \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva therefore recommended Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja as the emperor of this planet. Serving a devotee means serving the Supreme Lord, for a devotee always represents the Lord. When a devotee is in charge, the government is always congenial and beneficial for everyone."

        "translation": "Of the two energies manifest [spirit and dull matter], beings possessing living force [vegetables, grass, trees and plants] are superior to dull matter [stone, earth, etc.]. Superior to nonmoving plants and vegetables are worms and snakes, which can move. Superior to worms and snakes are animals that have developed intelligence. Superior to animals are human beings, and superior to human beings are ghosts because they have no material bodies. Superior to ghosts are the Gandharvas, and superior to them are the Siddhas. Superior to the Siddhas are the Kinnaras, and superior to them are the asuras. Superior to the asuras are the demigods, and of the demigods, Indra, the King of heaven, is supreme. Superior to Indra are the direct sons of Lord Brahm\u0101, sons like King Dak\u1e63a, and supreme among Brahm\u0101\u2019s sons is Lord \u015aiva. Since Lord \u015aiva is the son of Lord Brahm\u0101, Brahm\u0101 is considered superior, but Brahm\u0101 is also subordinate to Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because I am inclined to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are best of all.",
        "purport": " In this verse the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are given a position superior to that of the Supreme Lord. The idea is that the government should be conducted under the guidance of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Although \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva recommended His eldest son, Bharata, as emperor of the earth, he still had to follow the instructions of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as in order to govern the world perfectly. The Lord is worshiped as brahma\u1e47ya-deva. The Lord is very fond of devotees, or br\u0101hma\u1e47as. This does not refer to so-called caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but to qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a should be qualified with the eight qualities mentioned in text 24, such as \u015bama, dama, satya and titik\u1e63\u0101. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as should always be worshiped, and under their guidance the ruler should discharge his duty and rule the citizens. Unfortunately, in this Age of Kali, the executive is not selected by very intelligent people, nor is he guided by qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Consequently, chaos results. The mass of people should be educated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that according to the democratic process they can select a first-class devotee like Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to head the government. If the head of the state is headed by qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as, everything is completely perfect. In this verse, the evolutionary process is indirectly mentioned. The modern theory that life evolves from matter is to some extent supported in this verse because it is stated, bh\u016bte\u1e63u v\u012brudbhya\u1e25. That is, the living entities evolve from vegetables, grass, plants and trees, which are superior to dull matter. In other words, matter also has the potency to manifest living entities in the form of vegetables. In this sense, life comes out of matter, but matter also comes out of life. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8), aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhavo matta\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 pravartate: \u201cI am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.\u201d There are two energies \u2014 material and spiritual \u2014 and both originally come from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme living being. Although it may be said that in the material world a living force is generated from matter, it must be admitted that originally matter is generated from the supreme living being. Nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13). The conclusion is that everything, both material and spiritual, is generated from the Supreme Being. From the evolutionary point of view, perfection is reached when the living entity attains the platform of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is a worshiper of the Supreme Brahman, and the Supreme Brahman worships the br\u0101hma\u1e47a. In other words, the devotee is subordinate to the Supreme Lord, and the Lord is inclined to see to the satisfaction of His devotee. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is called dvija-deva, and the Lord is called dvija-deva-deva. He is the Lord of br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The evolutionary process is also explained in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya, Chapter Nineteen), wherein it is said that there are two types of living entities \u2014 moving and nonmoving. Among moving entities, there are birds, beasts, aquatics, human beings and so on. Of these, the human beings are supposed to be the best, but they are few. Of these small numbers of human beings, there are many low-class human beings like mlecchas, Pulindas, bauddhas and \u015babaras. The human being elevated enough to accept the Vedic principles is superior. Among those who accept the Vedic principles generally known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama (presently known as the Hindu system), few actually follow these principles. Of those who actually follow the Vedic principles, most perform fruitive activity or pious activity for elevation to a high position. Manu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 sahasre\u1e63u ka\u015bcid yatati siddhaye: out of many attached to fruitive activity, one may be a j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b \u2014 that is, one philosophically inclined and superior to the karm\u012bs. Yatat\u0101m api siddh\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 ka\u015bcin m\u0101\u1e41 vetti tattvata\u1e25: out of many j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, one may be liberated from material bondage, and out of many millions of liberated j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, one may become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

Demoniac civilization is attached to ugra-karma, horrible activities, and big industries are created to satisfy unfathomable lusty desires.

Those who actually want to return back to Godhead are ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana \u2014 that is, they have no desire for material comfort. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu advises, sandar\u015bana\u1e41 vi\u1e63ayin\u0101m atha yo\u1e63it\u0101\u1e41 ca h\u0101 hanta hanta visa-bhak\u1e63a\u1e47ato\u00a0\u2019py as\u0101dhu: material opulence and sense gratification through the association of women are more dangerous than poison. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as who are pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas always engage in the Lord\u2019s service and are devoid of any desire for material gain. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as do not worship demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101, Indra or Lord \u015aiva for any material comfort. They do not even ask the Supreme Lord for material profit; therefore it is concluded that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the supreme living entities of this world. \u015ar\u012b Kapiladeva also confirms this in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.29.33): The br\u0101hma\u1e47as are always dedicated to the Lord\u2019s service with their bodies, words and mind. There is no better person than a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who thus engages himself and dedicates himself to the Supreme Lord."

        "translation": "My dear sons, you should not envy any living entity \u2014 be he moving or nonmoving. Knowing that I am situated in them, you should offer respect to all of them at every moment. In this way, you offer respect to Me.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word vivikta-d\u1e5bgbhi\u1e25, meaning without envy, is used. All living entities are the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature. As confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: a\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha\u1e41 param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham. The Lord is situated in this universe as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. He is also situated within every atom. According to the Vedic statement: \u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam. The Supreme Lord is situated everywhere, and wherever He is situated is His temple. We even offer respects to a temple from a distant place, and all living entities should similarly be offered respect. This is different from the theory of pantheism, which holds that everything is God. Everything has a relationship with God because God is situated everywhere. We should not make any particular distinction between the poor and the rich like the foolish worshipers of daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is present in the rich as well as the poor. One should not simply think N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is situated among the poor. He is everywhere. An advanced devotee will offer respects to everyone \u2014 even to cats and dogs. \u201cThe humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].\u201d (Bg. 5.18) This sama-dar\u015bina\u1e25, equal vision, should not be mistaken to mean that the individual is the same as the Supreme Lord. They are always distinct. Every individual person is different from the Supreme Lord. It is a mistake to equate the individual living entity with the Supreme Lord on the plea of vivikta-d\u1e5bk, sama-d\u1e5bk. The Lord is always in an exalted position, even though He agrees to live everywhere. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, quoting Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, states: vivikta-d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di j\u012bv\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 dhi\u1e63\u1e47yatay\u0101 parame\u015bvarasya bheda-d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di\u1e25. \u201cOne who has clear vision and who is devoid of envy can see that the Supreme Lord is separate from all living entities, although He is situated in every living entity.\u201d Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya further quotes from Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cOne who sees the living entity and the Supreme Lord as always distinct is very dear to the Lord.\u201d Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a also states, yo hare\u015b caiva j\u012bv\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 bheda-vakt\u0101 hare\u1e25 priya\u1e25: \u201cOne who preaches that the living entities are separate from the Supreme Lord is very dear to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\u201d"

Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva instructed His one hundred sons, of whom the eldest, Bharata, was a very advanced devotee and a follower of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. In order to rule the whole world, the Lord enthroned His eldest son on the royal seat. Thereafter, although still at home, Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva lived like a madman, naked and with disheveled hair. Then the Lord took the sacrificial fire within Himself, and He left Brahm\u0101varta to tour the whole world.",

Thus people called Him many bad names and gave Him a great deal of trouble, but He did not care about this, for He understood that the body is simply meant for such an end. He was situated on the spiritual platform, and, being in His spiritual glory, He did not care for all these material insults. In other words, He completely understood that matter and spirit are separate, and He had no bodily conception. Thus, without being angry at anyone, He walked through the whole world alone.",

When a person fully realizes that the material body and world are temporary, he is not concerned with pain and pleasures of the body. As \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14): \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\u201d As far as \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva is concerned, it has already been explained: ida\u1e41 \u015bar\u012bra\u1e41 mama durvibh\u0101vyam. He did not at all possess a material body; and therefore He was tolerant of all the trouble offered to Him by the bad elements in society. Consequently He could tolerate people\u2019s throwing stool and dust upon Him and beating Him. His body was transcendental and consequently did not at all suffer pain. He was always situated in His spiritual bliss. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61): \u201cThe Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.\u201d Since the Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, He is in the heart of hogs and dogs also. If hogs and dogs in their material bodies live in filthy places, one should not think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature also lives in a filthy place. Although Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva was maltreated by the bad elements of the world, He was not at all affected. Therefore it is stated here, sva-mahima-avasth\u0101nena: \u201cHe was situated in His own glory.\u201d He was never saddened due to being insulted in the many ways described above."

His gentle smile always made His face beautiful, so much so that He even attracted the hearts of married women. It was as though they had been pierced by arrows of Cupid. About His head was an abundance of curly, matted brown hair. His hair was disheveled because His body was dirty and not taken care of. He appeared as if He were haunted by a ghost.",

        "translation": "O King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, just to show all the yog\u012bs the mystic process, Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, the plenary expansion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, performed wonderful activities. Actually He was the master of liberation and was fully absorbed in transcendental bliss, which increased a thousandfold. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, the son of Vasudeva, is the original source of Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva. There is no difference in Their constitution, and consequently Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva awakened the loving symptoms of crying, laughing and shivering. He was always absorbed in transcendental love. Due to this, all mystic powers automatically approached Him, such as the ability to travel in outer space at the speed of mind, to appear and disappear, to enter the bodies of others, and to see things far, far away. Although He could do all this, He did not exercise these powers.",
        "purport": " In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 19.149) it is said: The word \u015b\u0101nta means completely peaceful. Unless all one\u2019s desires are fulfilled, one cannot be peaceful. Everyone is trying to fulfill his aspirations and desires, be they material or spiritual. Those in the material world are a\u015b\u0101nta (without peace) because they have so many desires to fulfill. The pure devotee, however, is without desire. Any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya: a pure devotee is completely free from all kinds of material desire. Karm\u012bs, on the other hand, are simply full of desires because they try to enjoy sense gratification. They are not peaceful in this life, nor the next, during the past, present or future. Similarly, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are always aspiring after liberation and trying to become one with the Supreme. Yog\u012bs are aspiring after many siddhis (powers) \u2014 a\u1e47im\u0101, laghim\u0101, pr\u0101pti, etc. However, a devotee is not at all interested in these things because he is fully dependent on the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is yoge\u015bvara, the possessor of all mystic powers (siddhis), and He is \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma, fully self-satisfied. The yoga-siddhis are described in this verse. One can fly in outer space without the aid of a machine, and he can travel at the speed of mind. This means that as soon as a yog\u012b desires to go somewhere within this universe or even beyond this universe, he can do so immediately. One cannot estimate the speed of mind, for within a second the mind can go many millions of miles. Sometimes yog\u012bs enter into the bodies of other people and act as they desire when their bodies are not working properly. When the body becomes old, a perfect yog\u012b can find a young, able body. Giving up his old body, the yog\u012b can enter into the young body and act as he pleases. Being a plenary expansion of Lord V\u0101sudeva, Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva possessed all these mystic yoga powers, but He was satisfied with His devotional love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which was evinced by the ecstatic symptoms, such as crying, laughing and shivering."
