When the King\u2019s chief palanquin carriers reached the banks of the river Ik\u1e63umat\u012b, they needed another carrier. Therefore they began searching for someone, and by chance they came upon Ja\u1e0da Bharata. They considered the fact that Ja\u1e0da Bharata was very young and strong and had firm limbs. Like cows and asses, he was quite fit to carry loads. Thinking in this way, although the great soul Ja\u1e0da Bharata was unfit for such work, they nonetheless unhesitatingly forced him to carry the palanquin.",

As he stepped forward, he checked before him every three feet to see whether he was about to step on ants. Consequently he could not keep pace with the other carriers. Due to this, the palanquin was shaking, and King Rah\u016bga\u1e47a immediately asked the carriers, \u201cWhy are you carrying this palanquin unevenly? Better carry it properly.\u201d",
        "purport": " Although Ja\u1e0da Bharata was forced to carry the palanquin, he did not give up his sympathetic feelings toward the poor ants passing on the road. A devotee of the Lord does not forget his devotional service and other favorable activities, even when he is in a most distressful condition. Ja\u1e0da Bharata was a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a, highly elevated in spiritual knowledge, yet he was forced to carry the palanquin. He did not mind this, but while walking on the road, he could not forget his duty to avoid killing even an ant. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is never envious or unnecessarily violent. There were many ants on the path, but Ja\u1e0da Bharata took care by looking ahead three feet. When the ants were no longer in his way, he would place his foot on the ground. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always very kind at heart to all living entities. In His s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga, Lord Kapiladeva explains: suh\u1e5bda\u1e25 sarva-dehin\u0101m. Living entities assume different bodily forms. Those who are not Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas consider only human society worthy of their sympathy, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a claims to be the supreme father of all life forms. Consequently the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava takes care not to annihilate untimely or unnecessarily any life form. All living entities have to fulfill a certain duration for being encaged in a particular type of material body. They have to finish the duration allotted a particular body before being promoted or evolved to another body. Killing an animal or any other living being simply places an impediment in the way of his completing his term of imprisonment in a certain body. One should therefore not kill bodies for one\u2019s sense gratification, for this will implicate one in sinful activity."

You certainly appear very fatigued because you have carried this palanquin alone without assistance for a long time and for a long distance. Besides that, due to your old age you have become greatly troubled. My dear friend, I see that you are not very firm, nor very strong and stout. Aren\u2019t your fellow carriers cooperating with you?",
        "purport": " In this way the King criticized Ja\u1e0da Bharata with sarcastic words, yet despite being criticized in this way, Ja\u1e0da Bharata had no bodily conception of the situation. He knew that he was not the body, for he had attained his spiritual identity. He was neither fat, lean nor thin, nor had he anything to do with a lump of matter, a combination of the five gross and three subtle elements. He had nothing to do with the material body and its two hands and legs. In other words, he had completely realized his spiritual identity [aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi]. He was therefore unaffected by this sarcastic criticism from the King. Without saying anything, he continued carrying the palanquin as before. Ja\u1e0da Bharata was completely liberated. He did not even care when the dacoits attempted to kill his body; he knew that he certainly was not the body. Even if the body were killed, he would not have cared, for he was thoroughly convinced of the proposition found in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.20): na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre. He knew that he could not be killed even if his body were killed. Although he did not protest, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His agent could not tolerate the injustice of the dacoits; therefore he was saved by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the dacoits were killed. In this case, while carrying the palanquin, he also knew that he was not the body. This body was very strong and stout, in sound condition and quite competent to carry the palanquin. Due to his being freed from the bodily conception, the sarcastic words of the King did not at all affect him. The body is created according to one\u2019s karma, and material nature supplies the ingredients for the development of a certain type of body. The soul the body covers is different from the bodily construction; therefore anything favorable or mischievous done to the body does not affect the spirit soul. The Vedic injunction is asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25: the spirit soul is always unaffected by material arrangements."

Ja\u1e0da Bharata was the residence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; he always carried the form of the Lord within his heart. He was the dear friend of all living beings, and he did not entertain any bodily conception. He therefore smiled and spoke the following words.",
        "purport": " The distinction between a person in the bodily conception and a person beyond the bodily conception is presented in this verse. In the bodily conception, King Rah\u016bga\u1e47a considered himself a king and chastised Ja\u1e0da Bharata in so many unwanted ways. Being self-realized, Ja\u1e0da Bharata, who was fully situated on the transcendental platform, did not at all become angry; instead, he smiled and began to deliver his teachings to King Rah\u016bga\u1e47a. A highly advanced Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotee is a friend to all living entities, and consequently he is a friend to his enemies also. In fact, he does not consider anyone to be his enemy. Suh\u1e5bda\u1e25 sarva-dehin\u0101m. Sometimes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava becomes superficially angry at a nondevotee, but this is good for the nondevotee. We have several examples of this in Vedic literature. Once N\u0101rada became angry with the two sons of Kuvera, Nalak\u016bvara and Ma\u1e47igr\u012bva, and he chastised them by turning them into trees. The result was that later they were liberated by Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotee is situated on the absolute platform, and when he is angry or pleased, there is no difference, for in either case he bestows his benediction."

Actually these are not simply words of chastisement, for the body is the carrier. The load carried by the body does not belong to me, for I am the spirit soul. There is no contradiction in your statements because I am different from the body. I am not the carrier of the palanquin; the body is the carrier. Certainly, as you have hinted, I have not labored carrying the palanquin, for I am detached from the body. You have said that I am not stout and strong, and these words are befitting a person who does not know the distinction between the body and the soul. The body may be fat or thin, but no learned man would say such things of the spirit soul. As far as the spirit soul is concerned, I am neither fat nor skinny; therefore you are correct when you say that I am not very stout. Also, if the object of this journey and the path leading there were mine, there would be many troubles for me, but because they relate not to me but to my body, there is no trouble at all.",

The material body is completely separate from the spirit soul, and the pains and pleasures of the body are superfluous. The practice of austerity and penance is meant for understanding the distinction between the body and the soul and how the soul can be unaffected by the pleasures and pains of the body. Ja\u1e0da Bharata was actually situated on the platform of self-realization. He was completely aloof from the bodily conception; therefore he immediately took this position and convinced the King that whatever contradictory things the King had said about his body did not actually apply to him as a spirit soul."

One who is spiritually advanced has no connection with the body or with the bodily actions and reactions. When one comes to understand that he is not the body and therefore is neither fat nor skinny, one attains the topmost form of spiritual realization. When one is not spiritually realized, the bodily conception entangles one in the material world. At the present moment all human society is laboring under the bodily conception; therefore in the \u015b\u0101stras people in this age are referred to as dvipada-pa\u015bu, two-legged animals. No one can be happy in a civilization conducted by such animals. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is trying to raise fallen human society to the status of spiritual understanding. It is not possible for everyone to become immediately self-realized like Ja\u1e0da Bharata. However, as stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.18): na\u1e63\u1e6da-pr\u0101ye\u1e63v abhadre\u1e63u nitya\u1e41 bh\u0101gavata-sevay\u0101. By spreading the Bh\u0101gavata principles, we can raise human society to the platform of perfection. When one is not affected by the bodily conceptions, one can advance to the Lord\u2019s devotional service. The more we advance our freedom from the bodily conception, the more we are fixed in devotional service, and the more we are happy and peaceful. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says that those who are too materially affected continue the bodily conception. Such persons are concerned with different bodily symptoms, whereas one freed from bodily conceptions lives without the body even in the material condition."

In this regard, I can only say that this is the case everywhere because everything material has its beginning and end. As far as your thinking that you are the king and master and are thus trying to order me, this is also incorrect because these positions are temporary. Today you are a king and I am your servant, but tomorrow the position may be changed, and you may be my servant and I your master. These are temporary circumstances created by providence.",
        "purport": " The bodily conception is the basic principle of suffering in material existence. In Kali-yuga especially, people are so uneducated that they cannot even understand that the body is changing at every moment and that the ultimate change is called death. In this life one may be a king, and in the next life one may be a dog, according to karma. The spirit soul is in a deep slumber caused by the force of material nature. He is put in one type of condition and again changed into another type. Without self-realization and knowledge, conditional life continues, and one falsely claims himself a king, a servant, a cat or a dog. These are simply different transformations brought about by the supreme arrangement. One should not be misled by such temporary bodily conceptions. Actually no one is master within the material world, for everyone is under the control of material nature, which is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the ultimate master. As explained in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, ekale \u012b\u015bvara k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u0101ra saba bh\u1e5btya: the only master is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and everyone else is His servant. Forgetfulness of our relationship with the Supreme Lord brings about our suffering in the material world."

Being thus qualified, he heard from Ja\u1e0da Bharata that philosophical presentation which is approved by all scriptures on the mystic yoga process and which slackens the knot in the heart. His material conception of himself as a king was thus destroyed. He immediately descended from his palanquin and fell flat on the ground with his head at the lotus feet of Ja\u1e0da Bharata in such a way that he might be excused for his insulting words against the great br\u0101hma\u1e47a. He then prayed as follows.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.2) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cThis supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.\u201d Through the disciplic succession the royal order was on the same platform as great saintly persons (r\u0101ja-\u1e5b\u1e63is). Formerly they could understand the philosophy of life and knew how to train the citizens to come to the same standard. In other words, they knew how to deliver the citizens from the entanglement of birth and death. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Da\u015baratha ruled Ayodhy\u0101, the great sage Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra once came to him to take away Lord R\u0101macandra and Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a to the forest to kill a demon. When the saintly person Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra came to the court of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Da\u015baratha, the King, in order to receive the saintly person, asked him, aihi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 yat tat punar janma jay\u0101ya. He asked the sage whether everything was going on well in his endeavor to conquer the repetition of birth and death. The whole process of Vedic civilization is based on this point. We must know how to conquer the repetition of birth and death. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Rah\u016bga\u1e47a also knew the purpose of life; therefore when Ja\u1e0da Bharata put the philosophy of life before him, he immediately appreciated it. This is the foundation of Vedic society. Learned scholars, br\u0101hma\u1e47as, saintly persons and sages who were fully aware of the Vedic purpose advised the royal order how to benefit the general masses, and by their cooperation the general masses were benefited. Therefore everything was successful. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Rah\u016bga\u1e47a attained this perfection of understanding the value of human life; therefore he regretted his insulting words to Ja\u1e0da Bharata, and he immediately descended from his palanquin and fell down at the lotus feet of Ja\u1e0da Bharata in order to be excused and to hear from him further about the values of life known as brahma jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101 (inquiry into the Absolute Truth). At the present moment, high government officials are ignorant of the values of life, and when saintly persons endeavor to broadcast the Vedic knowledge, the so-called executives do not offer their respectful obeisances but try to obstruct the spiritual propaganda. Thus one can say that the former kingly government was like heaven and that the present government is like hell."

It is also significant that Rah\u016bga\u1e47a asked Ja\u1e0da Bharata which family he belonged to. There are two types of families \u2014 one according to dynasty and the other according to disciplic succession. In either way, one can be enlightened. The word \u015bukla\u1e25 refers to a person in the mode of goodness.

That is the difference between ordinary people and saintly people. The listener must also be advanced to understand the words of such exalted, spiritually advanced people as Ja\u1e0da Bharata. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken to Arjuna, not to others. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a especially selected Arjuna for instruction in spiritual knowledge because Arjuna happened to be a great devotee and confidential friend. Similarly, great personalities also speak to the advanced, not to \u015b\u016bdras, vai\u015byas, women or unintelligent men. Sometimes it is very risky to give great philosophical instructions to ordinary people, but \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, for the benefit of the fallen souls of Kali-yuga, has given us a very nice instrument, the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. The general mass of people, although \u015b\u016bdras and less, can be purified by chanting this Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. Then they can understand the exalted philosophical statements of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has therefore adopted the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra for the general masses. When people gradually become purified, they are instructed in the lessons of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Materialistic people like str\u012b, \u015b\u016bdra and dvija-bandhu cannot understand words of spiritual advancement, yet one can take to the shelter of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, for he knows the art of enlightening even \u015b\u016bdras in the highly elevated subject matter spoken in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

They know that the phenomenal world is a temporary manifestation but it is not false. A dream that we see at night is certainly false, but a horrible dream certainly affects the person seeing it. The soul\u2019s fatigue is not factual, but as long as one is immersed in the illusory bodily conception, one is affected by such false dreams. When dreaming, it is not possible to avoid the actual facts, and the conditioned soul is forced to suffer due to his dream. A waterpot is made of earth and is temporary. Actually there is no waterpot; there is simply earth. However, as long as the waterpot can contain water, we can use it in that way. It cannot be said to be absolutely false."

Actually every living being is an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but due to forgetfulness, a living entity engages himself as an eternal servant of m\u0101y\u0101. As long as one is engaged in m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s service, he cannot be happy. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement aims at engaging people in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. That will help them become freed from all material contamination and sinful activity. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.10): v\u012bta-r\u0101ga-bhaya-krodh\u0101\u1e25. By becoming detached from material activities, we will be freed from fear and anger. By austerity, one becomes purified and eligible to return home, back to Godhead. The duty of the king is to rule his citizens in such a way that they can become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. This would be very beneficial for everyone. Unfortunately the king or president engages people in sense gratification instead of the Lord\u2019s service, and such activities are certainly not beneficial for anyone. King Rah\u016bga\u1e47a tried to engage Ja\u1e0da Bharata in carrying the palanquin, which is a form of sense gratification for the King. However, if one is engaged as a palanquin carrier in the Lord\u2019s service, that is certainly beneficial. In this godless civilization, if a president engages people somehow or other in devotional service or the awakening of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he renders the very best service to the citizens."

        "translation": "O my dear lord, you are the friend of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the friend of all living entities. You are therefore equal to everyone, and you are free from the bodily conception. Although I have committed an offense by insulting you, I know that there is no loss or gain for you due to my insult. You are fixed in your determination, but I have committed an offense. Because of this, even though I may be as strong as Lord \u015aiva, I shall be vanquished without delay due to my offense at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava.",
        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Rah\u016bga\u1e47a was very intelligent and conscious of the inauspicious effects arising from insulting a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. He was therefore very anxious to be excused by Ja\u1e0da Bharata. Following in the footsteps of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Rah\u016bga\u1e47a, everyone should be very cautious not to commit an offense at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. \u015ar\u012bla V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura in the Caitanya-bh\u0101gavata (Madhya 13) says: \u201cEven if one is as strong as Lord \u015aiva, who carries a trident in his hand, one will nonetheless fall down from his spiritual position if he tries to insult a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. That is the verdict of all Vedic scriptures.\u201d He also says this in Caitanya-bh\u0101gavata (Madhya 22): \u201cOne who blasphemes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava cannot be protected by anyone. Even if a person is as strong as Lord \u015aiva, if he blasphemes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava he is sure to be destroyed. This is the verdict of all \u015b\u0101stras. If one does not care for the verdict of the \u015b\u0101stras and dares blaspheme a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he suffers life after life because of this.\u201d"
