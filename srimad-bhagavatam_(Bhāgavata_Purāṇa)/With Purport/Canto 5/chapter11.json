        "purport": " In this verse, two words are significant \u2014 veda-v\u0101da and tattva-v\u0101da. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, those who are simply attached to the Vedas and who do not understand the purpose of the Vedas or the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra are called veda-v\u0101da-rat\u0101\u1e25. \u201cMen of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say there is nothing more than this.\u201d (Bg. 2.42-43) The veda-v\u0101da followers of the Vedas are generally inclined to karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, the performance of sacrifice according to the Vedic injunctions. They are thereby promoted to higher planetary systems. They generally practice the C\u0101turm\u0101sya system. Ak\u1e63ayya\u1e41 ha vai c\u0101turm\u0101sya-y\u0101jina\u1e25 suk\u1e5bta\u1e41 bhavati: one who performs the c\u0101turm\u0101sya-yaj\u00f1a becomes pious. By becoming pious, one may be promoted to the higher planetary systems (\u016brdhva\u1e41 gacchanti sattva-sth\u0101\u1e25). Some of the followers of the Vedas are attached to karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, the fruitive activities of the Vedas, in order to be promoted to a higher standard of life. Others argue that this is not the purpose of the Vedas. Tad yathaiveha karma jita\u1e25 loka\u1e25 k\u1e63\u012byate evam evam utra pu\u1e47ya jita\u1e25 loka\u1e25 k\u1e63\u012byate. In this world someone may become very highly elevated by taking birth in an aristocratic family, by being well educated, beautiful or very rich. These are the gifts for pious activities enacted in the past life. However, these will be finished when the stock of pious activity is finished. If we become attached to pious activities, we may get these various worldly facilities in the next life and may take birth in the heavenly planets. But all this will eventually be finished. K\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti (Bg. 9.21): when the stock of pious activity is finished, one again has to come to this martya-loka. According to the Vedic injunctions, the performance of pious activity is not really the objective of the Vedas. The objective of the Vedas is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: the objective of the Vedas is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are veda-v\u0101d\u012bs are not actually advanced in knowledge, and those who are followers of j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (Brahman understanding) are also not perfect. However, when one comes to the platform of up\u0101san\u0101 and accepts the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes perfect (\u0101r\u0101dhan\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47or \u0101r\u0101dhana\u1e41 param). In the Vedas the worship of different demigods and the performance of sacrifice are certainly, mentioned, but such worship is inferior because the worshipers do not know that the ultimate goal is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um). When one comes to the platform of vi\u1e63\u1e47or \u0101r\u0101dhanam, or bhakti-yoga, one has attained the perfection of life. Otherwise, as indicated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one is not a tattva-v\u0101d\u012b but a veda-v\u0101d\u012b, a blind follower of the Vedic injunctions. A veda-v\u0101d\u012b cannot be purified from material contamination unless he becomes a tattva-v\u0101d\u012b, that is, one who knows tattva, the Absolute Truth. Tattva is also experienced in three features \u2014 brahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate. Even after coming to the platform of understanding tattva, one must worship Bhagav\u0101n, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and His expansions, or one is not yet perfect. Bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate: after many births, one who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The conclusion is that unintelligent men with a poor fund of knowledge cannot understand Bhagav\u0101n, Brahman or Param\u0101tm\u0101, but after studying the Vedas and attaining the understanding of the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is supposed to be on the platform of perfect knowledge."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.45), K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advised Arjuna to become transcendental to the material activities impelled by the three material modes of nature (traigu\u1e47ya-vi\u1e63ay\u0101 ved\u0101 nistraigu\u1e47yo bhav\u0101rjuna). The purpose of Vedic study is to transcend the activities of the three modes of material nature. Of course in the material world the mode of goodness is accepted as the best, and one can be promoted to the higher planetary systems by being on the sattva-gu\u1e47a platform. However, that is not perfection. One must come to the conclusion that even the sattva-gu\u1e47a platform is also not good. One may dream that he has become a king with a good family, wife and children, but immediately at the end of that dream he comes to the conclusion that it is false. Similarly, all kinds of material happiness are undesirable for a person who wants spiritual salvation. If a person does not come to the conclusion that he has nothing to do with any kind of material happiness, he cannot come to the platform of understanding the Absolute Truth, or tattva j\u00f1\u0101na. Karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs are after some material elevation. The karm\u012bs work hard day and night for some bodily comfort, and the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs simply speculate about how to get out of the entanglement of karma and merge into the Brahman effulgence. The yog\u012bs are very much addicted to the acquisition of material perfection and magical powers. All of them are trying to be materially perfect, but a devotee very easily comes to the platform of nirgu\u1e47a in devotional service, and consequently for the devotee the results of karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga become very insignificant. Therefore only the devotee is on the platform of tattva j\u00f1\u0101na, not the others. Of course the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b\u2019s position is better than that of the karm\u012b but that position is also insufficient. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b must actually become liberated, and after liberation he may be situated in devotional service (mad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m)."

        "purport": " In Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that material pious and impious activities are both opposed to the principle of devotional service. Devotional service means mukti, freedom from material entanglement, but pious and impious activities result in entanglement within this material world. If the mind is captivated by the pious and impious activities mentioned in the Vedas, one remains eternally in darkness; one cannot attain the absolute platform. To change the consciousness from ignorance to passion or from passion to goodness does not really solve the problem.

When the flame in a lamp burns the wick improperly, the lamp is blackened, but when the lamp is filled with ghee and is burning properly, there is bright illumination. Similarly, when the mind is absorbed in material sense gratification, it causes suffering, and when detached from material sense gratification it brings about the original brightness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.",
        "purport": " It is therefore concluded that the mind is the cause of material existence and liberation also. Everyone is suffering in this material world because of the mind; it is therefore proper to train the mind or to cleanse the mind from material attachment and engage it fully in the Lord\u2019s service. This is called spiritual engagement. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d We should engage the mind fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities. Then it will be the cause of our liberation, for our returning home, back to Godhead. However, if we keep the mind engaged in material activities for sense gratification, it will cause continuous bondage and will make us remain in this material world in different bodies, suffering the consequences of our different actions."

They have been existing from time immemorial. Sometimes they are manifest in the wakening state and in the dream state, but during deep sleep [unconsciousness] or trance, they disappear. A person who is liberated in this life [j\u012bvan-mukta] can see all these things vividly.",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.3), k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a\u1e41 c\u0101pi m\u0101\u1e41 viddhi sarva-k\u1e63etre\u1e63u bh\u0101rata. There are two kinds of k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a, or living beings. One is the individual living being, and the other is the supreme living being. The ordinary living being knows about his body to some extent, but the Supreme, Param\u0101tm\u0101, knows the condition of all bodies. The individual living being is localized, and the Supreme, Param\u0101tm\u0101, is all-pervading. In this \u015bloka the word k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a refers to an ordinary living being, not the supreme living being. This ordinary living being is of two kinds \u2014 nitya-baddha or nitya-mukta. One is eternally conditioned and the other eternally liberated. The eternally liberated living beings are in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha jagat, the spiritual world, and they never fall into the material world. Those in the material world are conditioned souls, nitya-baddha. The nitya-baddhas can become liberated by controlling the mind because the cause of conditioned life is the mind. When the mind is trained and the soul is not under the mind\u2019s control, the soul can be liberated even in this material world. When it is liberated, one is called j\u012bvan-mukta. A j\u012bvan-mukta knows how he has become conditioned; therefore he tries to purify himself and return home, back to Godhead. The eternally conditioned soul is eternally conditioned because he is controlled by the mind. The conditioned state and liberated state are compared to the sleeping, unconscious state and the awakened state. Those who are sleeping and unconscious are eternally conditioned, but those who are awake understand that they are eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore even in this material world, they engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. As confirmed by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: \u012bh\u0101 yasya harer d\u0101sye. If one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, he is liberated, even though he appears to be a conditioned soul within the material world. J\u012bvan-mukta\u1e25 sa ucyate. In any condition, one is to be considered liberated if his only business is to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

He is the all-pervading cause of creation. He is full in Himself and is not dependent on others. He is perceived by hearing and direct perception. He is self-effulgent and does not experience birth, death, old age or disease. He is the controller of all the demigods, beginning with Lord Brahm\u0101. He is called N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and He is the shelter of living entities after the annihilation of this material world. He is full of all opulences, and He is the resting place of everything material. He is therefore known as V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His own potency, He is present within the hearts of all living entities, just as the air or vital force is within the bodies of all beings, moving and nonmoving. In this way He controls the body. In His partial feature, the Supreme Personality of Godhead enters all bodies and controls them.",

Every living being is controlled by the supreme living being, Param\u0101tm\u0101, who resides within everyone\u2019s heart. He is the puru\u1e63a, the puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ra, who creates this material world. The first puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ra is Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and that Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the plenary portion of the plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s first expansion is Baladeva, and His next expansions are V\u0101sudeva, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Aniruddha and Pradyumna. V\u0101sudeva is the original cause of the brahmajyoti, and the brahmajyoti is the expansion of the rays of the body of V\u0101sudeva. \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.40) The Supreme Personality of Godhead is thus described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cBy Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.\u201d (Bg. 9.4) This is the position of the plenary expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the all-pervading V\u0101sudeva, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha."

In this way one can control the mind. This is the instruction of all the \u015b\u0101stras. If one does not do so, one is doomed to follow the dictations of the mind. Another bona fide process is to abide strictly by the orders of the spiritual master and engage in the Lord\u2019s service.
