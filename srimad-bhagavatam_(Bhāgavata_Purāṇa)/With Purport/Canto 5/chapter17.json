        "translation": "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b said: My dear King, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the enjoyer of all sacrifices, appeared as V\u0101manadeva in the sacrificial arena of Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Then He extended His left foot to the end of the universe and pierced a hole in its covering with the nail of His big toe. Through the hole, the pure water of the Causal Ocean entered this universe as the Ganges River. Having washed the lotus feet of the Lord, which are covered with reddish powder, the water of the Ganges acquired a very beautiful pink color. Every living being can immediately purify his mind of material contamination by touching the transcendental water of the Ganges, yet its waters remain ever pure. Because the Ganges directly touches the lotus feet of the Lord before descending within this universe, she is known as Vi\u1e63\u1e47upad\u012b. Later she received other names like J\u0101hnav\u012b and Bh\u0101g\u012brath\u012b. After one thousand millenniums, the water of the Ganges descended to Dhruvaloka, the topmost planet in this universe. Therefore all learned sages and scholars proclaim Dhruvaloka to be Vi\u1e63\u1e47upada [\u201csituated on Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s lotus feet\u201d].",
        "purport": " In this verse, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes the glories of the Ganges River. The water of the Ganges is called patita-p\u0101van\u012b, the deliverer of all sinful living beings. It is a proven fact that a person who regularly bathes in the Ganges is purified both externally and internally. Externally his body becomes immune to all kinds of disease, and internally he gradually develops a devotional attitude toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Throughout India, many thousands of people live on the banks of the Ganges, and by regularly bathing in her waters, they are undoubtedly being purified both spiritually and materially. Many sages, including \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, have composed prayers in praise of the Ganges, and the land of India itself has become glorious because such rivers as the Ganges, Yamun\u0101, God\u0101var\u012b, K\u0101ver\u012b, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101 and Narmad\u0101 flow there. Anyone living on the land adjacent to these rivers is naturally advanced in spiritual consciousness. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says: Standing on His right foot and extending His left to the edge of the universe, Lord V\u0101mana became known as Trivikrama, the incarnation who performed three heroic deeds."

        "translation": "The seven great sages [Mar\u012bci, Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, Atri and so on] reside on planets beneath Dhruvaloka. Well aware of the influence of the water of the Ganges, to this day they keep Ganges water on the tufts of hair on their heads. They have concluded that this is the ultimate wealth, the perfection of all austerities, and the best means of prosecuting transcendental life. Having obtained uninterrupted devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they neglect all other beneficial processes like religion, economic development, sense gratification and even merging into the Supreme. Just as j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs think that merging into the existence of the Lord is the highest truth, these seven exalted personalities accept devotional service as the perfection of life.",
        "purport": " Transcendentalists are divided into two primary groups: the nirvi\u015be\u1e63a-v\u0101d\u012bs, or impersonalists, and the bhaktas, or devotees. The impersonalists do not accept spiritual varieties of life. They want to merge into the existence of the Supreme Lord in His Brahman feature (the brahmajyoti). The devotees, however, desire to take part in the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord. In the upper planetary system, the topmost planet is Dhruvaloka, and beneath Dhruvaloka are the seven planets occupied by the great sages, beginning with Mar\u012bci, Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha and Atri. All these sages regard devotional service as the highest perfection of life. Therefore they all carry the holy water of the Ganges on their heads. This verse proves that for one who has achieved the platform of pure devotional service, nothing else is important, even so-called liberation (kaivalya). \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b states that only by achieving pure devotional service of the Lord can one give up all other engagements as insignificant. Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b confirms his statement as follows: \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has perfectly enunciated and broadcast the process of bhakti-yoga. Consequently, for one who has taken shelter at the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, the highest perfection of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, kaivalya, or becoming one with the Supreme, is considered hellish, to say nothing of the karm\u012bs\u2019 aspiration to be promoted to the heavenly planets. Devotees consider such goals to be worthless phantasmagoria. There are also yog\u012bs, who try to control their senses, but they can never succeed without coming to the stage of devotional service. The senses are compared to poisonous snakes, but the senses of a bhakta engaged in the service of the Lord are like snakes with their poisonous fangs removed. The yog\u012b tries to suppress his senses, but even great mystics like Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra fail in the attempt. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was conquered by his senses when he was captivated by Menak\u0101 during his meditation. She later gave birth to \u015aakuntal\u0101. The wisest persons in the world, therefore, are the bhakti-yog\u012bs, as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.47): \u201cOf all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\u201d"

Then it inundates the moon [Candraloka] and finally reaches Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s abode atop Mount Meru.",
        "purport": " We should always remember that the Ganges River comes from the Causal Ocean, beyond the covering of the universe. After the water of the Causal Ocean leaks through the hole created by Lord V\u0101manadeva, it flows down to Dhruvaloka (the polestar) and then to the seven planets beneath Dhruvaloka. Then it is carried to the moon by innumerable celestial airplanes, and then it falls to the top of Mount Meru, which is known as Sumeru-parvata. In this way, the water of the Ganges finally reaches the lower planets and the peaks of the Him\u0101layas, and from there it flows through Hardwar and throughout the plains of India, purifying the entire land. How the Ganges water reaches the various planets from the top of the universe is explained herein. Celestial airplanes carry the water from the planets of the sages to other planets. So-called advanced scientists of the modern age are trying to go to the higher planets, but at the same time they are experiencing a power shortage on earth. If they were actually capable scientists, they could personally go by airplane to other planets, but this they are unable to do. Having now given up their moon excursions, they are attempting to go to other planets, but without success."

Passing over the tops of mountains in various lands, it falls down with fierce force upon the peaks of the mountains Hemak\u016b\u1e6da and Himak\u016b\u1e6da. After inundating the tops of those mountains, the Ganges falls down onto the tract of land known as Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a, which she also inundates. Then the Ganges flows into the ocean of salt water in the south. Persons who come to bathe in this river are fortunate. It is not very difficult for them to achieve with every step the results of performing great sacrifices like the R\u0101jas\u016bya and A\u015bvamedha yaj\u00f1as.",

On Makara-sa\u1e45kr\u0101nti, in the month of January\u2014February, thousands of people still go there to bathe, hoping to be liberated. That they can actually be liberated in this way is confirmed herein. For those who bathe in the Ganges at any time, the results of great sacrifices like the A\u015bvamedha and R\u0101jas\u016bya yaj\u00f1a are not at all difficult to achieve. Most people in India are still inclined to bathe in the Ganges, and there are many places where they can do so. At Pray\u0101ga (Allahabad), many thousands of people gather during the month of January to bathe in the confluence of the Ganges and Yamun\u0101. Afterward, many of them go to the confluence of the Bay of Bengal and the Ganges to take bath there. Thus it is a special facility for all the people of India that they can bathe in the water of the Ganges at so many places of pilgrimage."

        "translation": "Among the nine var\u1e63as, the tract of land known as Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a is understood to be the field of fruitive activities. Learned scholars and saintly persons declare the other eight var\u1e63as to be meant for very highly elevated pious persons. After returning from the heavenly planets, they enjoy the remaining results of their pious activities in these eight earthly var\u1e63as.",
        "purport": " The heavenly places of enjoyment are divided into three groups: the celestial heavenly planets, the heavenly places on earth, and the bila heavenly places, which are found in the lower regions. Among these three classes of heavenly places (bhauma-svarga-pada-ni), the heavenly places on earth are the eight var\u1e63as other than Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.21) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti: when the persons living in the heavenly planets exhaust the results of their pious activities, they return to this earth. In this way, they are elevated to the heavenly planets, and then they again fall to the earthly planets. This process is known as brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da bhrama\u1e47a, wandering up and down throughout the universes. Those who are intelligent \u2014 in other words, those who have not lost their intelligence \u2014 do not involve themselves in this process of wandering up and down. They take to the devotional service of the Lord so that they can ultimately penetrate the covering of this universe and enter the spiritual kingdom. Then they are situated on one of the planets known as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka or, still higher, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka (Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana). A devotee is never caught in the process of being promoted to the heavenly planets and again coming down. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says: Among all the living entities wandering throughout the universe, one who is most fortunate comes in contact with a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus gets the opportunity to execute devotional service. Those who are sincerely seeking the favor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a come in contact with a guru, a bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs indulging in mental speculation and the karm\u012bs desiring the results of their actions cannot become gurus. A guru must be a direct representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who distributes the instructions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without any change. Thus only the most fortunate persons come in contact with the guru. As confirmed in the Vedic literatures, tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet: one has to search out a guru to understand the affairs of the spiritual world. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also confirms this point. Tasm\u0101d guru\u1e41 prapadyeta jij\u00f1\u0101su\u1e25 \u015breya uttamam: one who is very interested in understanding the activities in the spiritual world must search out a guru \u2014 a bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. From all angles of vision, therefore, the word guru is especially meant for the bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and no one else. Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a states, avai\u1e63\u1e47avo gurur na sy\u0101t: one who is not a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or who is not a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, cannot be a guru. Even the most qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a cannot become a guru if he is not a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as are supposed to acquire six kinds of auspicious qualifications: they become very learned scholars (pa\u1e6dhana) and very qualified teachers (p\u0101\u1e6dhana); they become expert in worshiping the Lord or the demigods (yajana), and they teach others how to execute this worship (y\u0101jana); they qualify themselves as bona fide persons to receive alms from others (pratigraha), and they distribute the wealth in charity (d\u0101na). Yet even a br\u0101hma\u1e47a possessing these qualifications cannot become a guru unless he is the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (gurur na sy\u0101t). Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u1e25 \u015bva-paco guru\u1e25: but a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a bona fide representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, can become a guru even if he is \u015bva-paca, a member of a family of dog-eaters. Of the three divisions of heavenly planets (svarga-loka), bhauma-svarga is sometimes accepted as the tract of land in Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a known as Kashmir. In this region there are certainly good facilities for material sense enjoyment, but this is not the business of a pure transcendentalist. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes the engagement of a pure transcendentalist as follows: \u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\u201d Those who fully engage in devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a just to please Him are not interested in the three divisions of heavenly places, namely, divya-svarga, bhauma-svarga and bila-svarga."

        "translation": "In these eight var\u1e63as, or tracts of land, human beings live ten thousand years according to earthly calculations. All the inhabitants are almost like demigods. They have the bodily strength of ten thousand elephants. Indeed, their bodies are as sturdy as thunderbolts. The youthful duration of their lives is very pleasing, and both men and women enjoy sexual union with great pleasure for a long time. After years of sensual pleasure \u2014 when a balance of one year of life remains \u2014 the wife conceives a child. Thus the standard of pleasure for the residents of these heavenly regions is exactly like that of the human beings who lived during Tret\u0101-yuga.",
        "purport": " There are four yugas: Satya-yuga, Tret\u0101-yuga, Dv\u0101para-yuga and Kali-yuga. During the first yuga, Satya-yuga, people were very pious. Everyone practiced the mystic yoga system for spiritual understanding and realization of God. Because everyone was always absorbed in sam\u0101dhi, no one was interested in material sense enjoyment. During Tret\u0101-yuga, people enjoyed sense pleasure without tribulations. Material miseries began in Dv\u0101para-yuga, but they were not very stringent. Stringent material miseries really began from the advent of Kali-yuga. Another point in this verse is that in all eight of these heavenly var\u1e63as, although men and women enjoy sex pleasure, there is no pregnancy. Pregnancy takes place only in lower-grade life. For example, animals like dogs and hogs become pregnant twice a year, and each time they beget at least half a dozen offspring. Even lower species of life such as snakes give birth to hundreds of young at one time. This verse informs us that in grades of life higher than ours, pregnancy occurs once in a lifetime. People still have sex life, but there is no pregnancy. In the spiritual world, people are not very attracted to sex life, due to their exalted devotional attitude. Practically speaking, there is no sex life in the spiritual world, but even if sometimes it does occur, there is no pregnancy at all. On the planet earth, however, human beings do become pregnant, although the tendency is to avoid having children. In this sinful Age of Kali, people have even taken to the process of killing the child in the womb. This is the most degraded practice; it can only perpetuate the miserable material conditions of those who perform it."

Between the great mountains demarcating the borders of those lands lie enormous lakes of clear water filled with newly grown lotus flowers. Aquatic birds such as swans, ducks, water chickens, and cranes become greatly excited by the fragrance of lotus flowers, and the charming sound of bumblebees fills the air. The inhabitants of those lands are important leaders among the demigods. Always attended by their respective servants, they enjoy life in gardens alongside the lakes. In this pleasing situation, the wives of the demigods smile playfully at their husbands and look upon them with lusty desires. All the demigods and their wives are constantly supplied with sandalwood pulp and flower garlands by their servants. In this way, all the residents of the eight heavenly var\u1e63as enjoy, attracted by the activities of the opposite sex.",
        "purport": " Here is a description of the lower heavenly planets. The inhabitants of those planets enjoy life in a pleasing atmosphere of clear lakes filled with newly grown lotus flowers and gardens filled with fruits, flowers, various kinds of birds and humming bees. In that atmosphere they enjoy life with their very beautiful wives, who are always sexually stimulated. Nonetheless, they are all devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as will be explained in subsequent verses. The inhabitants of this earth also desire such heavenly enjoyment, but when they somehow or other achieve imitation pleasures like sex and intoxication, they completely forget the service of the Supreme Lord. In the heavenly planets, however, although the residents enjoy superior sense gratification, they never forget their positions as eternal servants of the Supreme Being."

In this way He remains near His devotees to accept their service.",
        "purport": " In this connection, Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura informs us that the demigods worship the Supreme Lord in His various Deity forms (arc\u0101-vigraha) because except in the spiritual world, the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be directly worshiped in person. In the material world, the Lord is always worshiped as the arc\u0101-vigraha, or Deity in the temple. There is no difference between the arc\u0101-vigraha and the original person, and therefore those who are engaged in worshiping the Deity in the temple in full opulence, even on this planet, should be understood to be directly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead without a doubt. As enjoined in the \u015b\u0101stras, arcye vi\u1e63\u1e47au \u015bil\u0101-dh\u012br guru\u1e63u nara-mati\u1e25: \u201cNo one should treat the Deity in the temple as stone or metal, nor should one think that the spiritual master is an ordinary human being.\u201d One should strictly follow this \u015b\u0101stric injunction and worship the Deity, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without offenses. The spiritual master is the direct representative of the Lord, and no one should consider him an ordinary human being. By avoiding offenses against the Deity and the spiritual master, one can advance in spiritual life, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In this regard, the following quotation appears in the Laghu-bh\u0101gavat\u0101m\u1e5bta: \u201cIn the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said that in the spiritual world the Lord personally expands in all directions and is worshiped as V\u0101sudeva, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. The same God is represented by the Deity in this material world, which is only one quarter of His creation. V\u0101sudeva, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are also present in the four directions of this material world. There is a Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka covered with water in this material world, and on that planet is a place called Vedavat\u012b, where V\u0101sudeva is located. Another planet known as Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka is situated above Satyaloka, and there Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a is present. Similarly, in Dv\u0101rak\u0101-pur\u012b, Pradyumna is the predominator. On the island known as \u015avetadv\u012bpa, there is an ocean of milk, and in the midst of that ocean is a place called Air\u0101vat\u012b-pura, where Aniruddha lies on Ananta. In some of the s\u0101tvata-tantras, there is a description of the nine var\u1e63as and the predominating Deity worshiped in each: (1) V\u0101sudeva, (2) Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, (3) Pradyumna, (4) Aniruddha, (5) N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, (6) N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, (7) Hayagr\u012bva, (8) Mah\u0101var\u0101ha, and (9) Brahm\u0101.\u201d The Lord Brahm\u0101 mentioned in this connection is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When there is no fit human being to empower as Lord Brahm\u0101, the Lord Himself takes the position of Lord Brahm\u0101. Tatra brahm\u0101 tu vij\u00f1eya\u1e25 p\u016brvokta-vidhay\u0101 hari\u1e25. That Brahm\u0101 mentioned here is Hari Himself."

Lord \u015aiva is in charge of the destruction of the material world. Lord Brahm\u0101 creates the material world, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u maintains it, and Lord \u015aiva destroys it. Because destruction is in the mode of ignorance, Lord \u015aiva and his worshipable Deity, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, are technically called t\u0101mas\u012b.

Since both Lord \u015aiva and Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a are always enlightened and situated in the transcendental position, they have nothing to do with the modes of material nature \u2014 goodness, passion and ignorance \u2014 but because their activities involve them with the mode of ignorance, they are sometimes called t\u0101mas\u012b."

There it is stated that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s incarnation as the serpentine Ananta \u015ae\u1e63a N\u0101ga supports all the universes on His hoods. By our calculation, a universe may be very, very heavy, but because the Lord is ananta (unlimited), He feels the weight to be no heavier than a mustard seed."

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who is the cause of creation and annihilation.",
        "purport": " K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): \u201cThis divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.\u201d All conditioned souls working within the illusory energy of the Lord consider the body to be the self, and thus they continuously wander throughout the universe, taking birth in different species of life and creating more and more problems. Sometimes they become disgusted with the problems and seek out a process by which they can get out of this entanglement. Unfortunately, such so-called research workers are unaware of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His illusory energy, and thus all of them work only in darkness, never finding a way out. So-called scientists and advanced research scholars are ludicrously trying to find the cause of life. They take no notice of the fact that life is already being produced. What will be their credit if they find out the chemical composition of life? All their chemicals are nothing but different transformations of the five elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air and ether. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.20), the living entity is never created (na j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 kad\u0101cin). There are five gross material elements and three minor material elements (mind, intelligence and ego), and there are eternal living entities. The living entity desires a certain type of body, and by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that body is created from material nature, which is nothing but a kind of machine handled by the Supreme Lord. The Lord gives the living entity a particular type of mechanical body, and the living entity must work with it according to the law of fruitive activities. Fruitive activities are described in this verse:\u00a0karma-parva\u1e47\u012b\u1e41 m\u0101y\u0101m. The living entity is seated on a machine (the body), and according to the order of the Supreme Lord, he operates the machine. This is the secret of transmigration of the soul from one body to another. The living entity thus becomes entangled in fruitive activities in this material world. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7), mana\u1e25 \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u012bndriy\u0101\u1e47i prak\u1e5bti-sth\u0101ni kar\u1e63ati: the living entity is struggling very hard against the six senses, which include the mind. In all the activities of creation and annihilation, the living entity is entangled in fruitive activities, which are executed by the illusory energy, m\u0101y\u0101. He is exactly like a computer handled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The so-called scientists say that nature acts independently, but they cannot explain what nature is. Nature is nothing but a machine operated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one understands the operator, his problems of life are solved. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19): \u201cAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.\u201d A sane man, therefore, surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus gets out of the clutches of the illusory energy, m\u0101y\u0101."
