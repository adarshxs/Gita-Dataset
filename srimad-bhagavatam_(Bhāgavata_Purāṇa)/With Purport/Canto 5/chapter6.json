For such people, the powers of mystic yoga automatically arise. They do not cause distress. Why, then, did \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva neglect them?",

Whatever is necessary for the discharge of devotional service is automatically attained, though it may appear to be the result of mystic yoga power. Sometimes a yog\u012b displays a little yogic power by manufacturing gold. A little quantity of gold captivates foolish people, and thus the yog\u012b gets many followers, who are willing to accept such a tiny person as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a yog\u012b may also advertise himself as Bhagav\u0101n. However, a devotee does not have to exhibit such magical wonders. Without practicing the mystic yogic process, he achieves even greater opulence all over the world. Under the circumstances, Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva refused to manifest mystic yogic perfections, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it asked why He did not accept them, since, for a devotee, they are not at all disturbing. A devotee is never distressed or satisfied by material opulence. His concern is how to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, by the grace of the Supreme Lord, a devotee achieves extraordinary opulence, he utilizes the opportunity for the Lord\u2019s service. He is not disturbed by the opulence."

        "purport": " The first business of one trying to advance in spiritual life is to control the mind and senses. As \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7): Although the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and are therefore in a transcendental position, they are still suffering in this material world and struggling for existence due to the mind and the senses. To get out of this false struggle for existence and become happy in the material world, one has to control the mind and senses and be detached from material conditions. One should never neglect austerities and penances; one should always perform them. Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva personally showed us how to do this. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (9.19.17) it is specifically stated: A g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha, sanny\u0101s\u012b and brahmac\u0101r\u012b should be very careful when associating with women. One is forbidden to sit down in a solitary place even with one\u2019s mother, sister or daughter. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement it has been very difficult to disassociate ourselves from women in our society, especially in Western countries. We are therefore sometimes criticized, but nonetheless we are trying to give everyone a chance to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra and thus advance spiritually. If we stick to the principle of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra offenselessly, then, by the grace of \u015ar\u012bla Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, we may be saved from the allurement of women. However, if we are not very strict in chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, we may at any time fall victim to women."

Unfortunately, in the present age, women are never controlled. According to the directions of the \u015b\u0101stras, women are never to be given freedom. When a child, a woman must be strictly controlled by her father. When she is young, she must be strictly controlled by her husband, and when she is old, she must be controlled by her elderly sons. If she is given independence and allowed to mingle unrestrictedly with men, she will be spoiled. A spoiled woman, being manipulated by paramours, might even kill her husband. This example is given here because a yog\u012b desiring to get free from material conditions must always keep his mind under control. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura used to say that in the morning our first business should be to beat the mind with shoes a hundred times, and, before going to bed, to beat the mind a hundred times with a broomstick. In this way one\u2019s mind can be kept under control. An uncontrolled mind and an unchaste wife are the same. An unchaste wife can kill her husband at any time, and an uncontrolled mind, followed by lust, anger, greed, madness, envy and illusion, can certainly kill the yog\u012b. When the yog\u012b is controlled by the mind, he falls down into the material condition. One should be very careful of the mind, just as a husband should be careful of an unchaste wife."

Consequently no one could observe His divine opulence. He adopted this behavior just to teach yog\u012bs how to give up the body. Nonetheless, He maintained His original position as a plenary expansion of Lord V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Remaining always in that state, He gave up His pastimes as Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva within the material world. If, following in the footsteps of Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, one can give up his subtle body, there is no chance that one will accept a material body again.",

One must understand his constitutional position and the constitutional position of the Supreme Lord as well. Both have the same spiritual identity. Maintaining oneself as a servant of the Supreme Lord, one should avoid rebirth in this material world. If one keeps himself spiritually fit and thinks of himself as an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord, he will be successful at the time he has to give up the material body."

Taking advantage of Kali-yuga, the age of sinful activity, King Arhat, being bewildered, gave up the Vedic principles, which are free from risk, and concocted a new system of religion opposed to the Vedas. That was the beginning of the Jain dharma. Many other so-called religions followed this atheistic system.",

He desired to compete with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, during the time of Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, the King of Ko\u1e45ka and Ve\u1e45ka acted like a paramaha\u1e41sa and imitated Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva. He introduced a system of religion and took advantage of the fallen condition of the people in this Age of Kali. It is said in Vedic literatures that people in this age will be more inclined to accept anyone as the Supreme Lord and accept any religious system opposed to Vedic principles. The people in this age are described as mand\u0101\u1e25 sumanda-mataya\u1e25. Generally they have no spiritual culture, and therefore they are very fallen. Due to this, they will accept any religious system. Due to their misfortune. they forget the Vedic principles. Following non-Vedic principles in this age, they think themselves the Supreme Lord and thus spread the cult of atheism all over the world."

The followers of King Arhat went under the name Jains, and they were later followed by many others, particularly by the hippies, who are more or less offshoots of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy because they think themselves the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The followers of Vedic literature understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different incarnations, and they are privileged to glorify the Lord by following the directions of Vedic literature. After realizing the glories of human life, such people should take up the mission to spread the importance of human life throughout the whole world. This is the mission of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. The word adhipu\u1e47yam indicates that there are certainly many other pious men throughout the world but the people of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a are even more pious. Therefore they are fit to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Consciousness throughout the world for the benefit of all human society. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya also recognizes the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a: vi\u015be\u1e63\u0101d bh\u0101rate pu\u1e47yam. Throughout the world, there is no question of bhagavad-bhakti or devotional service, but the people of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a can easily understand the devotional service of the Lord. Thus every inhabitant of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a can perfect his life by discharging bhagavad-bhakti and then preaching this cult throughout the world for the benefit of everyone."

        "purport": " Devotional service unto the Lord is the highest attainment for anyone desiring liberation from the tribulations of material existence. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.22), ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101 c\u0101para\u1e41 l\u0101bha\u1e41 manyate n\u0101dhika\u1e41 tata\u1e25: \u201cGaining this, one thinks there is no greater gain.\u201d When one attains the service of the Lord, which is non-different from the Lord, one does not desire anything material.

For a devotee, mukti is not a very great achievement. Mukti means being situated in one\u2019s constitutional position. The constitutional position of every living being is that of the Lord\u2019s servant; therefore when a living entity is engaged in the Lord\u2019s loving service, he has already attained mukti. Consequently a devotee does not aspire for mukti, even if it is offered by the Supreme Lord Himself."

Those engaged in getting the Lord\u2019s favor attain liberation from the Lord very easily, but He does not very easily give the opportunity to render direct service unto Him.",
        "purport": " While instructing Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b thought it wise to encourage the King because the King might be thinking of the glorious position of various royal dynasties. Especially glorious is the dynasty of Priyavrata, in which the Supreme Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva incarnated. Similarly, the family of Utt\u0101nap\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the father of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva, is also glorious due to King P\u1e5bthu\u2019s taking birth in it. The dynasty of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Raghu is glorified because Lord R\u0101macandra appeared in that family. As far as the Yadu and Kuru dynasties are concerned, they existed simultaneously, but of the two, the Yadu dynasty was more glorious due to the appearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it might have been thinking that the Kuru dynasty was not as fortunate as the others because the Supreme Lord did not appear in that family, neither as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord R\u0101macandra, Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva or Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu. Therefore Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was encouraged by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b in this particular verse. The Kuru dynasty may be considered more glorious due to the presence of devotees like the five P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who rendered unalloyed devotional service. Although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not appear in the Kuru dynasty, He was so obligated to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas\u2019 devotional service that He acted as a maintainer of the family and spiritual master of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. Although He took birth in the Yadu dynasty, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was more affectionate to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. By His actions, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proved that He was more inclined to the Kuru dynasty than the Yadu dynasty. Indeed, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, indebted to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas\u2019 devotional service, sometimes acted as their messenger, and He guided them through many dangerous situations. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it should not have been saddened because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not appear in his family. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always inclined toward His pure devotees, and by His action it is clear that liberation is not very important for the devotees. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a easily gives one liberation, but He does not so easily give one the facility to become a devotee. Mukti\u1e41 dad\u0101ti karhicit sma na bhakti-yogam. Directly or indirectly, it is proved that bhakti-yoga is the basis for the supreme relationship with the Supreme Lord. It is far superior to liberation. For a pure devotee of the Lord, mukti is automatically attained."

Being the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva is complete in Himself. We living entities, as parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, should follow the instructions of Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva and become self-sufficient. We should not create unnecessary demands due to the bodily conception. When one is self-realized, he is sufficiently satisfied due to being situated in his original spiritual position. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101 na \u015bocati na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati. This is the goal of all living entities.

Satisfaction through self-realization is called svar\u016bp\u0101nanda. The conditioned soul, eternally sleeping in darkness, does not understand his self-interest. He simply tries to become happy by making material adjustments, but this is impossible. It is therefore said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um: due to gross ignorance, the conditioned soul does not know that his real self-interest is to take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. To try to become happy by adjusting the material atmosphere is a useless endeavor. Indeed, it is impossible. By His personal behavior and instructions, Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva enlightened the conditioned soul and showed him how to become self-sufficient in his spiritual identity."
