However, one cannot always obtain the Supreme Lord through this paraphernalia. Nonetheless, the Lord is affectionate to His devotee; therefore when Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi, who was a devotee, worshiped and offered prayers to the Lord with great faith and devotion and with a pure uncontaminated mind, superficially performing some yaj\u00f1a in the line of pravargya, the kind Supreme Personality of Godhead, due to His affection for His devotees, appeared before King N\u0101bhi in His unconquerable and captivating form with four hands. In this way, to fulfill the desire of His devotee, the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifested Himself in His beautiful body before His devotee. This body pleases the mind and eyes of the devotees.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly said: \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d (Bg. 18.55) One can understand and see the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the process of devotional service, and not in any other way. Although Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi performed prescribed duties and sacrifices, it should still be considered that the Lord appeared before him not due to his sacrifices but because of his devotional service. It was for this reason that the Lord agreed to appear before him in His beautiful bodily features. As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.30), the Supreme Lord in His original nature is very beautiful.

        "translation": "Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u appeared before King N\u0101bhi with four arms. He was very bright, and He appeared to be the best of all personalities. Around the lower portion of His body, He wore a yellow silken garment. On His chest was the mark of \u015ar\u012bvatsa, which always displays beauty. He carried a conchshell, lotus flower, disc and club, and He wore a garland of forest flowers and the Kaustubha gem. He was beautifully decorated with a helmet, earrings, bangles, belt, pearl necklace, armlets, ankle bells and other bodily ornaments bedecked with radiant jewels. Seeing the Lord present before them, King N\u0101bhi and his priests and associates felt just like poor people who have suddenly attained great riches. They received the Lord and respectfully bent their heads and offered Him things in worship.",
        "purport": " It is distinctly mentioned here that the Supreme Personality of Godhead did not appear as an ordinary human being. He appeared before King N\u0101bhi and his associates as the best of all personalities (Puru\u1e63ottama). As stated in the Vedas: Nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13). The Supreme Personality of Godhead is also a living being, but He is the supreme living being. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.7), Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself says, matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat ki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1jaya: \u201cO conqueror of wealth [Arjuna], there is no truth superior to Me.\u201d No one is more attractive or more authoritative than Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is one of the differences between God and an ordinary living being. According to this description of the transcendental body of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Lord can easily be distinguished from all other living beings. Consequently Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi and his priests and associates all offered the Lord obeisances and began to worship Him with various things. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.22), ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101 c\u0101para\u1e41 l\u0101bha\u1e41 manyate n\u0101dhika\u1e41 tata\u1e25. That is, \u201cUpon gaining this, one thinks that there is no greater gain.\u201d When one realizes God and sees the Lord face to face, one certainly thinks that he has gained the best of all things. Raso\u00a0\u2019py asya para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate: when one experiences a higher taste, his consciousness is fixed. After seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one ceases to be attracted by anything material. One then remains steady in his worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

He is always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune.\u201d We can have some conception of the Absolute Truth, His form and His attributes simply by reading the descriptions given in Vedic literatures and authoritative statements given by exalted personalities like Brahm\u0101, N\u0101rada, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and others. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says, ata\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101m\u0101di na bhaved gr\u0101hyam indriyai\u1e25: \u201cWe cannot conceive the name, form and qualities of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through our material senses.\u201d Because of this, other names for the Lord are adhok\u1e63aja and apr\u0101k\u1e5bta, which indicate that He is beyond any material senses.

He does not want promotion to the heavenly planets or mukti, liberation from material bondage. If this were the case, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu would not have said, mama janmani janmani. It doesn\u2019t matter to a devotee whether or not he takes birth life after life, as long as he remains a devotee. Actually eternal liberty means returning home, back to Godhead. A devotee is never concerned about anything material. Although N\u0101bhi Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted a son like Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, wanting a son like God is also a form of sense gratification. A pure devotee wants only to engage in the Lord\u2019s loving service."

No one can see the path of this material energy or tell how it is working.",
        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi was inclined to performing great sacrifices for begetting a son. The son might be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but such a material desire \u2014 be it great or insignificant \u2014 is brought about by the influence of m\u0101y\u0101. A devotee does not at all desire anything for sense gratification. Devotion is therefore explained as devoid of material desires (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya). Everyone is subjected to the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 and entangled in all kinds of material desire, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi was no exception. Freedom from m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s influence is possible when one engages in the service of the great devotees (mahac-cara\u1e47a-sev\u0101). Without worshiping the lotus feet of a great devotee, one cannot be freed from m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s influence. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore says, ch\u0101\u1e0diy\u0101 vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-sev\u0101 nist\u0101ra p\u0101yeche keb\u0101: \u201cWho has been freed from m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s clutches without serving the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava?\u201d M\u0101y\u0101 is apar\u0101jita, and her influence is also apar\u0101jita. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): \u201cThis divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.\u201d Only a devotee can surpass m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s great influence. It was no fault on Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi\u2019s part that he wanted a son. He wanted a son like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the best of all sons. By the association of the Lord\u2019s devotee, one no longer desires material opulence. This is confirmed in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.54): and: If one is serious about escaping m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s influence and returning home, back to Godhead, one must associate with a s\u0101dhu (devotee). That is the verdict of all scriptures. By the slight association of a devotee, one can be freed from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. Without the mercy of the pure devotee, one cannot get freedom by any means. Certainly a pure devotee\u2019s association is necessary in order to obtain the loving service of the Lord. One cannot be freed from m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s clutches without s\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45ga, the benediction of a great devotee. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (7.5.32) Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja says: One cannot become the Lord\u2019s pure devotee without taking the dust of a great devotee on his head (p\u0101da-rajo-\u2019bhi\u1e63ekam). A pure devotee is ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana; he has no material desire to enjoy the material world. One has to take shelter of such a pure devotee in order to attain his qualities. The pure devotee is always free from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 and her influence."

        "purport": " The priests were certainly unhappy to have called the Supreme Lord from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha for such an insignificant reason. A pure devotee never wants to see the Lord unnecessarily. The Lord is engaged in various activities, and the pure devotee does not want to see Him whimsically, for his own sense gratification. The pure devotee simply depends on the Lord\u2019s mercy, and when the Lord is pleased, he can see Him face to face. The Lord is unseen even by demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. By calling on the Supreme Lord, the priests of N\u0101bhi Mah\u0101r\u0101ja proved themselves unintelligent; nonetheless, the Lord came out of His causeless mercy. All of them therefore wanted to be excused by the Lord. Worship of the Supreme Lord for material gain is not approved by authorities. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.16): \u201cO best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me \u2014 the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.\u201d Initiation into bhakti begins when one is in a distressed condition or in want of money, or when one is inquisitive to understand the Absolute Truth. Nonetheless, people who approach the Supreme Lord in this way are not actually devotees. They are accepted as pious (suk\u1e5btina\u1e25) due to their inquiring about the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Not knowing the various activities and engagements of the Lord, such people unnecessarily disturb the Lord for material gain. However, the Lord is so kind that even though disturbed, He fulfills the desires of such beggars. The pure devotee is any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya; he has no motive behind his worship. He is not conducted by the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 in the form of karma or j\u00f1\u0101na. The pure devotee is always prepared to execute the order of the Lord without personal consideration. The \u1e5btvija\u1e25, the priests at the sacrifice, knew very well the distinction between karma and bhakti, and because they considered themselves under the influence of karma, fruitive activity, they begged the Lord\u2019s pardon. They knew that the Lord had been invited to come for some paltry reason."

        "translation": "O Vi\u1e63\u1e47udatta, Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was pleased by the great sages at that sacrifice. Consequently the Lord decided to personally exhibit the method of executing religious principles [as observed by brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, sanny\u0101s\u012bs, v\u0101naprasthas and g\u1e5bhasthas engaged in rituals] and also satisfy Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi\u2019s desire. Consequently He appeared as the son of Merudev\u012b in His original spiritual form, which is above the modes of material nature.",
        "purport": " When the Supreme Lord appears or descends as an incarnation within this material world, He does not accept a body made of the three modes of material nature (sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a). M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers say that the impersonal God appears in this material world by accepting a body in the sattva-gu\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b states that the word \u015bukla means \u201cconsisting of \u015buddha-sattva.\u201d Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u descends in His \u015buddha-sattva form. \u015auddha-sattva refers to the sattva-gu\u1e47a which is never contaminated. In this material world, even the mode of goodness (sattva-gu\u1e47a) is contaminated by tinges of rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a. When sattva-gu\u1e47a is never contaminated by rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a, it is called \u015buddha-sattva. Sattva\u1e41 vi\u015buddha\u1e41 vasudeva-\u015babditam (Bh\u0101g. 4.3.23). That is the platform of vasudeva, whereby the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva, can be experienced. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.7) \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself says: \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself.\u201d Unlike ordinary living entities, the Supreme Lord is not forced by the modes of material nature to appear. He appears dharm\u0101n dar\u015bayitu-k\u0101ma \u2014 to show how to execute the functions of a human being. The word dharma is meant for human beings and is never used in connection with beings inferior to human beings, such as animals. Unfortunately, without being guided by the Supreme Lord, human beings sometimes manufacture a process of dharma by concoction. Actually dharma cannot be made by man. Dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam. (Bh\u0101g. 6.3.19) Dharma is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the law is given by the state government. Man-made dharma has no meaning. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam refers to man-made dharma as kaitava-dharma, cheating religion. The Supreme Lord sends an avat\u0101ra (incarnation) to teach human society the proper way to execute religious principles. Such religious principles are bhakti-m\u0101rga. As the Supreme Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. The son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, appeared on this earth to preach the principles of religion. That will be explained in the Fifth Chapter of this Fifth Canto."
