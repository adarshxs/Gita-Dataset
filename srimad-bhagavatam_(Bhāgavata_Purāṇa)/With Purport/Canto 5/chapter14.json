        "translation": "When King Par\u012bk\u1e63it asked \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b about the direct meaning of the material forest, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b replied as follows: My dear King, a man belonging to the mercantile community [va\u1e47ik] is always interested in earning money. Sometimes he enters the forest to acquire some cheap commodities like wood and earth and sell them in the city at good prices. Similarly, the conditioned soul, being greedy, enters this material world for some material profit. Gradually he enters the deepest part of the forest, not really knowing how to get out. Having entered the material world, the pure soul becomes conditioned by the material atmosphere, which is created by the external energy under the control of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Thus the living entity comes under the control of the external energy, daiv\u012b m\u0101y\u0101. Living independently and bewildered in the forest, he does not attain the association of devotees who are always engaged in the service of the Lord. Once in the bodily conception, he gets different types of bodies one after the other under the influence of material energy and impelled by the modes of material nature [sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a]. In this way the conditioned soul goes sometimes to the heavenly planets, sometimes to the earthly planets and sometimes to the lower planets and lower species. Thus he suffers continuously due to different types of bodies. These sufferings and pains are sometimes mixed. Sometimes they are very severe, and sometimes they are not. These bodily conditions are acquired due to the conditioned soul\u2019s mental speculation. He uses his mind and five senses to acquire knowledge, and these bring about the different bodies and different conditions. Using the senses under the control of the external energy, m\u0101y\u0101, the living entity suffers the miserable conditions of material existence. He is actually searching for relief, but he is generally baffled, although sometimes he is relieved after great difficulty. Struggling for existence in this way, he cannot get the shelter of pure devotees, who are like bumblebees engaged in loving service at the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.",
        "purport": " The most important information in this verse is hari-guru-cara\u1e47a-aravinda-madhukara-anupadav\u012bm. In this material world the conditioned souls are baffled by their activities, and sometimes they are relieved after great difficulty. On the whole the conditioned soul is never happy. He simply struggles for existence. Actually his only business is to accept the spiritual master, the guru, and through him he must accept the lotus feet or the Lord. This is explained by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja. People struggling for existence in the forests or cities of the material world are not actually enjoying life. They are simply suffering different pains and pleasures, generally pains that are always inauspicious. They try to gain release from these pains, but they cannot due to ignorance. For them it is stated in the Vedas: tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet. When the living entity is lost in the forest of the material world, in the struggle for existence, his first business is to find a bona fide guru who is always engaged at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. After all, if he is at all eager to be relieved of the struggle for existence, he must find a bona fide guru and take instructions at his lotus feet. In this way he can get out of the struggle. Since the material world is compared herein to a forest, it may be argued that in Kali-yuga modern civilization is mainly situated in the cities. A great city, however, is like a great forest. Actually city life is more dangerous than life in the forest. If one enters an unknown city without friend or shelter, living in that city is more difficult than living in a forest. There are many big cities all over the surface of the globe, and wherever one looks he sees the struggle for existence going on twenty-four hours a day. People rush about in cars going seventy and eighty miles an hour, constantly coming and going, and this sets the scene of the great struggle for existence. One has to rise early in the morning and travel in that car at breakneck speed. There is always the danger of an accident, and one has to take great care. In his automobile, the living entity is full of anxieties, and his struggle is not at all auspicious. Apart from human beings, other species like cats and dogs are also struggling very hard day and night for existence. Thus the struggle for existence continues, and the conditioned soul changes from one position to another. For a while, he is a child, but he has to become a boy. From a boy, he has to change into a youth, and from youth to manhood and old age. Finally, when the body is no longer workable, he has to accept a new body in a different species. Giving up the body is called death, and accepting another body is called birth. The human form is an opportunity to take shelter of the bona fide spiritual master and, through him, the Supreme Lord. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has been started to give an opportunity to all the members of human society, who are misled by foolish leaders. No one can get out of this struggle for existence, which is full of miseries, without accepting a pure devotee of the Lord. The material attempt changes from one position to another, and no one actually gains relief from the struggle for existence. The only resort is the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master, and, through him, the lotus feet of the Lord."

The conditioned soul may earn some money for the advancement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but unfortunately the uncontrolled senses plunder his money through sense gratification. The senses are plunderers because they make one spend his money unnecessarily for seeing, smelling, tasting, touching, hearing, desiring and willing. In this way the conditioned soul is obliged to gratify his senses, and thus all his money is spent. This money is actually acquired for the execution of religious principles, but it is taken away by the plundering senses.",

By following the principles of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, one attains a better position in the material world. One may be rich, learned, beautiful or highborn. One who has all these assets should know that they are all meant for the advancement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Unfortunately, when a person is misguided he misuses his high position for sense gratification. Therefore the uncontrolled senses are considered plunderers. The good position one attains by executing religious principles is wasted as the plundering senses take it away. By executing religious principles under the laws of var\u1e47a\u015brama-dharma, one is placed in a comfortable position. One may very easily use his assets for the further advancement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should understand that the wealth and opportunity one gets in the material world should not be squandered in sense gratification. They are meant for the advancement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore teaching people to control the mind and five knowledge-acquiring senses by a definite process. One should practice a little austerity and not spend money on anything other than the regulative life of devotional service. The senses demand that one see beautiful things; therefore money should be spent for decorating the Deity in the temple. Similarly, the tongue has to taste good food, which should be bought and offered to the Deity. The nose can be utilized in smelling the flowers offered to the Deity, and the hearing can be utilized by listening to the vibration of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. In this way the senses can be regulated and utilized to advance K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Thus a good position might not be spoiled by material sense gratification in the form of illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. One spoils an opulent position in the material world by driving cars, spending time in nightclubs or tasting abominable food in restaurants. In these ways, the plundering senses take away all the assets that the conditioned soul has acquired with great difficulty."

During the day there are household expenditures, and the money earned by the husband at the cost of his blood is taken away. At night, due to sex pleasure, the husband discharges blood in the form of semen. In this way he is bled by his wife both day and night, yet he is so crazy that he very carefully maintains her. Similarly, the children are also like tigers, jackals and foxes. As tigers, jackals and foxes take away lambs despite the herdsman\u2019s vigilant protection, children take away the father\u2019s money, although the father supervises the money himself.

Nonetheless, the seeds lie there and, not being completely burned, again come up with the plants sown in the field. Even after being plowed under, the weeds come up densely. Similarly, the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama [family life] is a field of fruitive activity. Unless the desire to enjoy family life is completely burned out, it grows up again and again. Even though camphor may be removed from a pot, the pot nonetheless retains the aroma of camphor. As long as the seeds of desire are not destroyed, fruitive activities are not destroyed.",
        "purport": " Unless one\u2019s desires are completely transferred to the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the desire for family life continues, even after one has taken sanny\u0101sa. Sometimes in our society, ISKCON, a person out of sentiment may take sanny\u0101sa, but because his desires are not burned completely, he again takes to family life, even at the risk of losing his prestige and disgracing his good name. These strong desires can be burned out completely when one fully engages in the service of the Lord in devotional service."

        "translation": "Sometimes, as if blinded by the dust of a whirlwind, the conditioned soul sees the beauty of the opposite sex, which is called pramad\u0101. Being thus bewildered, he is raised upon the lap of a woman, and at that time his good senses are overcome by the force of passion. He thus becomes almost blind with lusty desire and disobeys the rules and regulations governing sex life. He does not know that his disobedience is witnessed by different demigods, and he enjoys illicit sex in the dead of night, not seeing the future punishment awaiting him.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.11) it is said: dharm\u0101viruddho bh\u016bte\u1e63u k\u0101mo\u00a0\u2019smi bharatar\u1e63abha. Sex is allowed only for the begetting of children, not for enjoyment. One can indulge in sex to beget a good child for the benefit of the family, society and world. Otherwise, sex is against the rules and regulations of religious life. A materialistic person does not believe that everything is managed in nature, and he does not know that if one does something wrong, he is witnessed by different demigods. A person enjoys illicit sex, and due to his blind, lusty desire, he thinks that no one can see him, but this illicit sex is thoroughly observed by the agents of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the person is punished in so many ways. Presently in Kali-yuga there are many pregnancies due to illicit sex, and sometimes abortions ensue. These sinful activities are witnessed by the agents of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a man and woman who create such a situation are punished in the future by the stringent laws of material nature (daiv\u012b hy e\u1e63\u0101 gu\u1e47a-may\u012b mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101). Illicit sex is never excused, and those who indulge in it are punished life after life. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.20): \u201cAttaining repeated birth among the species of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not allow anyone to act against the stringent laws of material nature; therefore illicit sex is punished life after life. Illicit sex creates pregnancies, and these unwanted pregnancies lead to abortion. Those involved become implicated in these sins, so much so that they are punished in the same way the next life. Thus in the next life they also enter the womb of a mother and are killed in the same way. All these things can be avoided by remaining on the transcendental platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In this way one does not commit sinful activity. Illicit sex is the most prominent sin due to lusty desire. When one associates with the mode of passion, he is implicated in suffering life after life."

However, due to his strong bodily conception, his memory is destroyed, and again and again he runs after material enjoyment, just as an animal runs after a mirage in the desert.",
        "purport": " The main disease in material life is the bodily conception. Being baffled again and again in material activity, the conditioned soul temporarily thinks of the futility of material enjoyment, but he again tries the same thing. By the association of devotees, a person may become convinced of the material futility, but he cannot give up his engagement, although he is very eager to return home, back to Godhead. Under these circumstances, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, compassionately takes away all the material possessions of such a devotee. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.88.8): yasy\u0101ham anug\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101mi hari\u1e63ye tad-dhana\u1e41 \u015banai\u1e25. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He takes everything away from the devotee whom He especially favors when that devotee is overly attached to material possessions. When everything is taken away, the devotee feels helpless and frustrated in society, friendship and love. He feels that his family does not care for him any longer, and he therefore completely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. This is a special favor granted by the Lord to a devotee who cannot fully surrender to the Lord due to a strong bodily conception. As explained in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.39): \u0101mi \u2014 vij\u00f1a, ei m\u016brkhe\u00a0\u2018vi\u1e63aya\u2019 kene diba. The Lord understands the devotee who hesitates to engage in the Lord\u2019s service, not knowing whether he should again try to revive his material life. After repeated attempts and failures, he fully surrenders to the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord then gives him directions, and, attaining happiness, he forgets all material engagement."

        "translation": "Sometimes, to mitigate distresses in this forest of the material world, the conditioned soul receives cheap blessings from atheists. He then loses all intelligence in their association. This is exactly like jumping in a shallow river. As a result one simply breaks his head. He is not able to mitigate his sufferings from the heat, and in both ways he suffers. The misguided conditioned soul also approaches so-called s\u0101dhus and sv\u0101m\u012bs who preach against the principles of the Vedas. He does not receive benefit from them, either in the present or in the future.",
        "purport": " Cheaters are always there to manufacture their own way of spiritual realization. To get some material benefit, the conditioned soul approaches these pseudo sanny\u0101s\u012bs and yog\u012bs for cheap blessings, but he does not receive any benefit from them, either spiritual or material. In this age there are many cheaters who show some jugglery and magic. They even create gold to amaze their followers, and their followers accept them as God. This type of cheating is very prominent in Kali-yuga. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura describes the real guru in this way. One should approach a guru who can extinguish the blazing fire of this material world, the struggle for existence. People want to be cheated, and therefore they go to yog\u012bs and sv\u0101m\u012bs who play tricks, but tricks do not mitigate the miseries of material life. If being able to manufacture gold is a criterion for becoming God, then why not accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the proprietor of the entire universe, wherein there are countless tons of gold? As mentioned before, the color of gold is compared to the will-o\u2019-the-wisp or yellow stool; therefore one should not be allured by gold-manufacturing gurus but should sincerely approach a devotee like Ja\u1e0da Bharata. Ja\u1e0da Bharata instructed Rah\u016bga\u1e47a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja so well that the King was relieved from the bodily conception. One cannot become happy by accepting a false guru. A guru should be accepted as advised in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.3.21). Tasm\u0101d guru\u1e41 prapadyeta jij\u00f1\u0101su\u1e25 \u015breya uttamam: One should approach a bona fide guru to inquire about the highest benefit of life. Such a guru is described as follows: \u015b\u0101bde pare ca ni\u1e63\u1e47\u0101tam. Such a guru does not manufacture gold or juggle words. He is well versed in the conclusions of Vedic knowledge (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). He is freed from all material contamination and is fully engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. If one is able to obtain the dust of the lotus feet of such a guru, his life becomes successful. Otherwise he is baffled both in this life and in the next."

These are all the duties of a g\u1e5bhastha, and they are very extensive and troublesome to execute. They are compared to a big hill over which one must cross when one is attached to material activities. A person desiring to cross over these ritualistic ceremonies certainly feels pains like the piercing of thorns and pebbles endured by one attempting to climb a hill. Thus the conditioned soul suffers unlimitedly.",
        "purport": " There are many social functions for keeping a prestigious position in society. In different countries and societies there are various festivals and rituals. In India, the father is supposed to get his children married. When he does so, his responsibility to the family is complete. Arranging marriages is very difficult, especially in these days. At the present moment no one can perform the proper ritual of sacrifice, nor can anyone afford to pay for the marriage ceremony of sons and daughters. Therefore householders are very much distressed when they are confronted by these social duties. It is as though they were pierced by thorns and hurt by pebbles. Material attachment is so strong that despite the suffering, one cannot give it up. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore recommends (Bh\u0101g. 7.5.5): The so-called comfortable family position is compared to a dark well in a field. If one falls in a dark well covered by grass, his life is lost, despite his cry for rescue. Highly advanced spiritualists therefore recommend that one should not enter the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. It is better to prepare oneself in the brahmacarya-\u0101\u015brama for austerities and remain a pure brahmac\u0101r\u012b throughout one\u2019s life so that one will not feel the piercing thorns of material life in the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. In the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama one has to accept invitations from friends and relatives and perform ritualistic ceremonies. By so doing, one becomes captivated by such things, although he may not have sufficient resources to continue them. To maintain the g\u1e5bhastha lifestyle, one has to work very hard to acquire money. Thus one is implicated in material life, and he suffers the thorn pricks."

Consequently illicit sex must be stopped by those who are spiritually inclined or who are on the path of spiritual realization. Many devotees fall down due to illicit sex.

        "translation": "Stealing or cheating another person out of his money, the conditioned soul somehow or other keeps it in his possession and escapes punishment. Then another man, named Devadatta, cheats him and takes the money away. Similarly, another man, named Vi\u1e63\u1e47umitra, steals the money from Devadatta and takes it away. In any case, the money does not stay in one place. It passes from one hand to another. Ultimately no one can enjoy the money, and it remains the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " Riches come from Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the goddess of fortune, and the goddess of fortune is the property of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The goddess of fortune cannot stay anywhere but by the side of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; therefore another of her names is Ca\u00f1cal\u0101, restless. She cannot be peaceful unless she is in the company of her husband, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. For example, Lak\u1e63m\u012b was carried away by the materialistic R\u0101va\u1e47a. R\u0101va\u1e47a kidnapped S\u012bt\u0101, the goddess of fortune belonging to Lord R\u0101ma. As a result, R\u0101va\u1e47a\u2019s entire family, opulence and kingdom were smashed, and S\u012bt\u0101, the goddess of fortune, was recovered from his clutches and reunited with Lord R\u0101ma. Thus all property, riches and wealth belong to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29): \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is the true beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, and He is the supreme proprietor of all the planetary systems.\u201d Foolish materialistic people collect money and steal from other thieves, but they cannot keep it. In any case, it must be spent. One person cheats another, and another person cheats someone else; therefore the best way to possess Lak\u1e63m\u012b is to keep her by the side of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. This is the point of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. We worship Lak\u1e63m\u012b (R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b) along with N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a). We collect money from various sources, but that money does not belong to anyone but R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a). If money is utilized in the service of Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the devotee automatically lives in an opulent way. However, if one wants to enjoy Lak\u1e63m\u012b the way R\u0101va\u1e47a did, he will be vanquished by the laws of nature, and whatever few possessions he has will be taken away. Finally death will take everything away, and death is the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

Unless one is liberated from material conditioning, these four defects must be there. Consequently every man has a cheating propensity, which is employed in business or money transactions. Although two friends may be living peacefully together, due to their propensity to cheat they become enemies when there is a transaction between them. A philosopher accuses an economist of being a cheater, and an economist may accuse a philosopher of being a cheater when he comes in contact with money. In any case, this is the condition of material life. One may profess a high philosophy, but when one is in need of money, he becomes a cheater. In this material world, so-called scientists, philosophers and economists are nothing but cheaters in one way or another. The scientists are cheaters because they present so many bogus things in the name of science. They propose going to the moon, but actually they end up cheating the entire public of large sums of money for their experiments. They cannot do anything useful. Unless one can find a person transcendental to the four basic defects, one should not accept advice and become a victim of the material condition. The best process is to take the advice and instructions of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His bona fide representative. In this way one can be happy in this life and the next."

They have attained the human form in order to get released from material bondage, but instead of doing so, they become further embarrassed amid the miserable material conditions. Therefore they are nar\u0101dhamas, the lowest of men. One may ask whether scientists, philosophers, economists and mathematicians are also nar\u0101dhamas, the lowest of men, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead replies that they are because they have no actual knowledge. They are simply proud of their false prestige and position. Actually they do not know how to get relief from the material condition and renovate their spiritual life of transcendental bliss and knowledge. Consequently they waste time and energy in the search for so-called happiness. These are the qualifications of the demons. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it says that when one has all these demonic qualities, he becomes a m\u016b\u1e0dha. Due to this, he envies the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore birth after birth he is born into a demonic family, and he transmigrates from one demonic body to another. Thus he forgets his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and remains a nar\u0101dhama in an abominable condition life after life."

Thus he loses his intelligence as well as knowledge of life\u2019s goal. At that time, no longer attempting spiritual cultivation, he becomes overly attached to his wife or girlfriend and tries to provide her with a suitable apartment. Again, he becomes very busy under the shelter of that home and is captivated by the talks, glances and activities of his wife and children. In this way he loses his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and throws himself in the dense darkness of material existence.",
        "purport": " When the conditioned soul is embraced by his beloved wife, he forgets everything about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The more he becomes attached to his wife, the more he becomes implicated in family life. One Bengali poet, Bankim Chandra, says that to the eyes of the lover the beloved is always very beautiful, even though ugly. This attraction is called deva-m\u0101y\u0101. The attraction between man and woman is the cause of bondage for both. Actually both belong to the par\u0101 prak\u1e5bti, the superior energy of the Lord, but both are actually prak\u1e5bti (female). However, because both want to enjoy one another, they are sometimes described as puru\u1e63a (male). Actually neither is puru\u1e63a, but both can be superficially described as puru\u1e63a. As soon as man and woman are united, they become attached to home, hearth, land, friendship and money. In this way they are both entrapped in material existence. The word bhuja-lat\u0101-upag\u016b\u1e0dha, meaning \u201cbeing embraced by beautiful arms which are compared to creepers,\u201d describes the way the conditioned soul is bound within this material world. The products of sex life \u2014 sons and daughters \u2014 certainly follow. This is the way of material existence."

        "translation": "The personal weapon used by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the disc, is called hari-cakra, the disc of Hari. This cakra is the wheel of time. It expands from the beginning of the atoms up to the time of Brahm\u0101\u2019s death, and it controls all activities. It is always revolving and spending the lives of the living entities, from Lord Brahm\u0101 down to an insignificant blade of grass. Thus one changes from infancy, to childhood, to youth and maturity, and thus one approaches the end of life. It is impossible to check this wheel of time. This wheel is very exacting because it is the personal weapon of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes the conditioned soul, fearing the approach of death, wants to worship someone who can save him from imminent danger. Yet he does not care for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose weapon is the indefatigable time factor. The conditioned soul instead takes shelter of a man-made god described in unauthorized scriptures. Such gods are like buzzards, vultures, herons and crows. Vedic scriptures do not refer to them. Imminent death is like the attack of a lion, and neither vultures, buzzards, crows nor herons can save one from such an attack. One who takes shelter of unauthorized man-made gods cannot be saved from the clutches of death.",
        "purport": " It is stated: hari\u1e41 vin\u0101 m\u1e5bti\u1e41 na taranti. No one can save himself from the cruel hands of death without being favored by Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated, m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te: whoever fully surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be saved from the cruel hands of material nature. The conditioned soul, however, sometimes wants to take shelter of a demigod, man-made god, pseudo incarnation or bogus sv\u0101m\u012b or yog\u012b. All these cheaters claim to follow religious principles, and all this has become very popular in this Age of Kali. There are many p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bs who, without referring to the \u015b\u0101stras, pose themselves as incarnations, and foolish people follow them. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has left behind Him \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Not referring to these authorized scriptures, rascals take shelter of man-made scriptures and try to compete with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the greatest difficulty one encounters when trying to promote spiritual consciousness in human society. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is trying its best to bring people back to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in its pure form, but the p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bs and atheists, who are cheaters, are so numerous that sometimes we become perplexed and wonder how to push this movement forward. In any case, we cannot accept the unauthorized ways of so-called incarnations, gods, cheaters and bluffers, who are described here as crows, vultures, buzzards and herons."

They themselves are fallen and cheated because they do not know the real path of spiritual advancement, and whoever goes to them is certainly cheated in his turn. When one is thus cheated, he sometimes takes shelter of the real followers of Vedic principles [br\u0101hma\u1e47as or those in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness], who teach everyone how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the Vedic rituals. However, being unable to stick to these principles, these rascals again fall down and take shelter among \u015b\u016bdras who are very expert in making arrangements for sex indulgence. Sex is very prominent among animals like monkeys, and such people who are enlivened by sex may be called descendants of monkeys.",
        "purport": " By fulfilling the process of evolution from the aquatics to the animal platform, a living entity eventually reaches the human form. The three modes of material nature are always working in the evolutionary process. Those who come to the human form through the quality of sattva-gu\u1e47a were cows in their last animal incarnation. Those who come to the human form through the quality of rajo-gu\u1e47a were lions in their last animal incarnation. And those who come to the human form through the quality of tamo-gu\u1e47a were monkeys in their last animal incarnation. In this age, those who come through the monkey species are considered by modern anthropologists like Darwin to be descendants of monkeys. We receive information herein that those who are simply interested in sex are actually no better than monkeys. Monkeys are very expert in sexual enjoyment, and sometimes sex glands are taken from monkeys and placed in the human body so that a human being can enjoy sex in old age. In this way modern civilization has advanced. Many monkeys in India were caught and sent to Europe so that their sex glands could serve as replacements for those of old people. Those who actually descend from the monkeys are interested in expanding their aristocratic families through sex. In the Vedas there are also certain ceremonies especially meant for sexual improvement and promotion to higher planetary systems, where the demigods are enjoying sex. The demigods are also very much inclined toward sex because that is the basic principle of material enjoyment. First of all, the conditioned soul is cheated by so-called sv\u0101m\u012bs, yog\u012bs and incarnations when he approaches them to be relieved of material miseries. When the conditioned soul is not satisfied with them, he comes to devotees and pure br\u0101hma\u1e47as who try to elevate him for final liberation from material bondage. However, the unscrupulous conditioned soul cannot rigidly follow the principles prohibiting illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. Thus he falls down and takes shelter of people who are like monkeys. In the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement these monkey disciples, being unable to follow the strict regulative principles, sometimes fall down and try to form societies based on sex. This is proof that such people are descendants of monkeys, as confirmed by Darwin. In this verse it is therefore clearly stated: yath\u0101 v\u0101nara j\u0101te\u1e25."

They are always engaged in material activities, known as gr\u0101mya-karma, and they work hard for material benefit. Thus they forget completely that one day their small life spans will be finished and they will be degraded in the evolutionary cycle.",
        "purport": " Materialistic people are sometimes called \u015b\u016bdras, or descendants of monkeys, due to their monkeylike intelligence. They do not care to know how the evolutionary process is taking place, nor are they eager to know what will happen after they finish their small human life span. This is the attitude of \u015b\u016bdras. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s mission, this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, is trying to elevate \u015b\u016bdras to the br\u0101hma\u1e47a platform so that they will know the real goal of life. Unfortunately, being overly attached to sense gratification, materialists are not serious in helping this movement. Instead, some of them try to suppress it. Thus it is the business of monkeys to disturb the activities of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The descendants of monkeys completely forget that they have to die, and they are very proud of scientific knowledge and the progress of material civilization. The word gr\u0101mya-karma\u1e47\u0101 indicates activities meant only for the improvement of bodily comforts. Presently all human society is engaged in improving economic conditions and bodily comforts. People are not interested in knowing what is going to happen after death, nor do they believe in the transmigration of the soul. When one scientifically studies the evolutionary theory, one can understand that human life is a junction where one may take the path of promotion or degradation. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25): \u201cThose who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with Me.\u201d In this life we have to prepare ourselves for promotion to the next life. Those who are in the mode of rajo-gu\u1e47a are generally interested in being promoted to the heavenly planets. Some, unknowingly, are degraded to lower animal forms. Those in the mode of goodness can engage in devotional service, and after that they can return home, back to Godhead (y\u0101nti mad-y\u0101jino\u00a0\u2019pi m\u0101m). That is the real purpose of human life. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is trying to bring intelligent human beings to the platform of devotional service. Instead of wasting time trying to attain a better position in material life, one should simply endeavor to return home, back to Godhead. Then all problems will be solved. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.17): \u201c\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Param\u0101tm\u0101 [Supersoul] in everyone\u2019s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses the desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.\u201d One simply has to follow the regulative principles, act like a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and read Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. In this way one purifies himself of the baser material modes (tamo-gu\u1e47a and rajo-gu\u1e47a) and, becoming freed from the greed of these modes, can attain complete peace of mind. In this way one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead and one\u2019s relationship with Him and thus be promoted to the highest perfection (siddhi\u1e41 param\u0101\u1e41 gat\u0101\u1e25)."

In order to acquire these things he has to cheat others, and this creates enmity even among the most intimate friends. Sometimes this enmity is created between the conditioned soul and the father or spiritual master. Unless one is firmly fixed in the regulative principles, one may perform mischievous acts, even if one is a member of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. We therefore advise our disciples to strictly follow the regulative principles; otherwise the most important movement for the upliftment of humanity will be hampered due to dissension among its members. Those who are serious about pushing forward this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement should remember this and strictly follow the regulative principles so that their minds will not be disturbed."

However, due to continuing on the path of danger from time immemorial and not associating with saintly persons, the conditioned soul, under illusion, wants to enjoy this material world. Material energy sometimes gives him a chance at so-called happiness, but the conditioned soul is perpetually being punished by material nature. It is therefore said: da\u1e47\u1e0dya-jane r\u0101j\u0101 yena nad\u012bte cub\u0101ya (Cc. Madhya 20.118). Materialistic life means continuous unhappiness, but sometimes we accept happiness as it appears between the gaps. Sometimes a condemned person is submerged in water and hauled out. Actually all of this is meant for punishment, but he feels a little comfort when he is taken out of the water. This is the situation with the conditioned soul. All the \u015b\u0101stras therefore advise that one associate with devotees and saintly people. Even by a little association with devotees, the conditioned soul can get out of this miserable material condition. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore trying to give everyone a chance to associate with saintly people. Therefore all the members of this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness society must themselves be perfect s\u0101dhus in order to give a chance to fallen conditioned souls. This is the best humanitarian work."

After reaping the results of his pious activities, he has to return to the lower planetary systems. In this way he perpetually goes up and comes down.",
        "purport": " In this regard \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says: Even if one wanders for many millions of years, from the time of creation until the time of annihilation, one cannot get free from the path of material existence unless one receives shelter at the lotus feet of a pure devotee. As a monkey takes shelter of the branch of a banyan tree and thinks he is enjoying, the conditioned soul, not knowing the real interest of his life, takes shelter of the path of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, fruitive activities. Sometimes he is elevated to the heavenly planets by such activities, and sometimes he again descends to earth. This is described by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu as brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da bhramite. However, if by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grace one is fortunate enough to come under the shelter of the guru, by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he receives lessons on how to execute devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In this way he receives a clue of how to get out of his continuous struggle up and down within the material world. Therefore the Vedic injunction is that one should approach a spiritual master. The Vedas declare: tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.2.12). Similarly in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.34) the Supreme Personality of Godhead advises: \u201cJust try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201d \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.3.21) gives similar advice: \u201cAny person who seriously desires to achieve real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of his spiritual master is that he must have realized the conclusion of the scriptures by deliberation and be able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities, who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, are to be understood as bona fide spiritual masters.\u201d Similarly, Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, a great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, also advises, yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101da\u1e25: \u201cBy the mercy of the spiritual master one receives the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d This is the same advice given by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu (guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja). This is essential. One must come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore one must take shelter of a pure devotee. Thus one can become free from the clutches of matter."

        "translation": "While in the prime of life, the great Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata gave up everything because he was fond of serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Uttama\u015bloka. He gave up his beautiful wife, nice children, great friends and an enormous empire. Although these things were very difficult to give up, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata was so exalted that he gave them up just as one gives up stool after evacuating. Such was the greatness of His Majesty.",
        "purport": " The name of God is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because He is so attractive that the pure devotee can give up everything within this material world on His behalf. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata was an ideal king, instructor and emperor of the world. He possessed all the opulences of the material world, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so attractive that He attracted Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata from all his material possessions. Yet somehow or other, the King became affectionate to a little deer and, falling from his position, had to accept the body of a deer in his next life. Due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s great mercy upon him, he could not forget his position, and he could understand how he had fallen. Therefore in the next life, as Ja\u1e0da Bharata, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata was careful not to spoil his energy, and therefore he presented himself as a deaf and dumb person. In this way he could concentrate on his devotional service. We have to learn from the great King Bharata how to become cautious in cultivating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A little inattention will retard our devotional service for the time being. Yet any service rendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is never lost: svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t (Bg. 2.40). A little devotional service rendered sincerely is a permanent asset. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.17): Somehow or other, if one is attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whatever he does in devotional service is a permanent asset. Even if one falls down due to immaturity or bad association, his devotional assets are never lost. There are many examples of this \u2014 Aj\u0101mila, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata, and many others. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is giving everyone a chance to engage in devotional service for at least some time. A little service will give one an impetus to advance and thus make one\u2019s life successful. In this verse the Lord is described as Uttama\u015bloka. Uttama means \u201cthe best,\u201d and \u015bloka means \u201creputation.\u201d Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full in six opulences, one of which is reputation. Ai\u015bvaryasya samagrasya v\u012bryasya ya\u015basa\u1e25 \u015briya\u1e25 (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 6.5.47). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s reputation is still expanding. We are spreading the glories of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by pushing forward this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s reputation, five thousand years after the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, is still expanding throughout the world. Every important individual within this world must have heard of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, especially at the present moment, due to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Even people who do not like us and want to suppress the movement are also somehow or other chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They say, \u201cThe Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a people should be chastised.\u201d Such foolish people do not realize the true value of this movement, but the mere fact that they want to criticize it gives them a chance to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this is its success."

He gave up his kingdom, his wife and his family. His opulence was so great that even the demigods envied it, yet he gave it up.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so attractive that one can give up all desirable things for His sake.

Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata was so attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that he gave up all his material possessions. Generally materialistic people are attracted by such possessions. \u201cOne becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one increases life\u2019s illusions and thinks in terms of\u00a0\u2018I and mine.\u2019\u201d The attraction for material things is certainly due to illusion. There is no value in attraction to material things, for the conditioned soul is diverted by them. One\u2019s life is successful if he is absorbed in the attraction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s strength, beauty and pastimes as described in the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs are attracted to merging into the existence of the Lord, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is more attractive than the desire to merge. The word abhava\u1e25 means \u201cnot to take birth again in this material world.\u201d A devotee doesn\u2019t care whether he is going to be reborn or not. He is simply satisfied with the Lord\u2019s service in any condition. That is real mukti. \u201cOne who acts to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person, even within this material world.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.187) A person who always desires to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is interested in ways to convince people that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead and that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is his ambition. It doesn\u2019t matter whether he is in heaven or in hell. This is called uttama\u015bloka-l\u0101lasa."

        "translation": "Devotees interested in hearing and chanting [\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam] regularly discuss the pure characteristics of Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and praise his activities. If one submissively hears and chants about the all-auspicious Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata, one\u2019s life span and material opulences certainly increase. One can become very famous and easily attain promotion to the heavenly planets, or attain liberation by merging into the existence of the Lord. Whatever one desires can be attained simply by hearing, chanting and glorifying the activities of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata. In this way, one can fulfill all his material and spiritual desires. One does not have to ask anyone else for these things, for simply by studying the life of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata, one can attain all desirable things.",
        "purport": " The forest of material existence is summarized in this Fourteenth Chapter. The word bhav\u0101\u1e6dav\u012b refers to the path of material existence. The merchant is the living entity who comes to the forest of material existence to try to make money for sense gratification. The six plunderers are the senses \u2014 eyes, ears, nose, tongue, touch and mind. The bad leader is diverted intelligence. Intelligence is meant for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but due to material existence we divert all our intelligence to achieve material facilities. Everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but due to our perverted mind and senses, we plunder the property of the Lord and engage in satisfying our senses. The jackals and tigers in the forest are our family members, and the herbs and creepers are our material desires. The mountain cave is our happy home, and the mosquitoes and serpents are our enemies. The rats, beasts and vultures are different types of thieves who take away our possessions, and the gandharva-pura is the phantasmagoria of the body and home. The will-o\u2019-the-wisp is our attraction for gold and its color, and material residence and wealth are the ingredients for our material enjoyment. The whirlwind is our attraction for our wife, and the dust storm is our blinding passion experienced during sex. The demigods control the different directions, and the cricket is the harsh words spoken by our enemy during our absence. The owl is the person who directly insults us, and the impious trees are impious men. The waterless river represents atheists who give us trouble in this world and the next. The meat-eating demons are the government officials, and the pricking thorns are the impediments of material life. The little taste experienced in sex is our desire to enjoy another\u2019s wife, and the flies are the guardians of women, like the husband, father-in-law, mother-in-law and so forth. The creeper itself is women in general. The lion is the wheel of time, and the herons, crows and vultures are so-called demigods, pseudo sv\u0101m\u012bs, yog\u012bs and incarnations. All of these are too insignificant to give one relief. The swans are the perfect br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and the monkeys are the extravagant \u015b\u016bdras engaged in eating, sleeping, mating and defending. The trees of the monkeys are our households, and the elephant is ultimate death. Thus all the constituents of material existence are described in this chapter."
