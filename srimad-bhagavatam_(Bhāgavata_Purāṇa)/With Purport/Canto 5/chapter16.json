        "purport": " In this verse it is stated that the planetary system known as Bh\u016b-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala extends to the limits of the sunshine. According to modern science, the sunshine reaches earth from a distance of 93,000,000 miles. If we calculate according to this modern information, 93,000,000 miles can be considered the radius of Bh\u016b-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala. In the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra, we chant om bh\u016br bhuva\u1e25 sva\u1e25. The word bh\u016br refers to Bh\u016b-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala. Tat savitur vare\u1e47yam: the sunshine spreads throughout Bh\u016b-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala. Therefore the sun is worshipable. The stars, which are known as nak\u1e63atra, are not different suns, as modern astronomers suppose. From Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.21) we understand that the stars are similar to the moon (nak\u1e63atr\u0101\u1e47\u0101m aha\u1e41 \u015ba\u015b\u012b). Like the moon, the stars reflect the sunshine. Apart from our modern distinguished estimations of where the planetary systems are located, we can understand that the sky and its various planets were studied long, long before \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was compiled. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b explained the location of the planets, and this indicates that the information was known long, long before \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b related it to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. The location of the various planetary systems was not unknown to the sages who flourished in the Vedic age."

In that transcendental position, one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva, who in His subtler form is self-effulgent and beyond the modes of nature. O my lord, please describe vividly how that form, which covers the entire universe, is perceived.",
        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it had already been advised by his spiritual master, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, to think of the universal form of the Lord, and therefore, following the advice of his spiritual master, he continuously thought of that form. The universal form is certainly material, but because everything is an expansion of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ultimately nothing is material. Therefore Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s mind was saturated with spiritual consciousness. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated: Everything, even that which is material, is connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore everything should be engaged in the service of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura translates this verse as follows: \u201cOne should not give up anything connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking it material or enjoyable for the material senses.\u201d Even the senses, when purified, are spiritual. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was thinking of the universal form of the Lord, his mind was certainly situated on the transcendental platform. Therefore although he might not have had any reason to be concerned with detailed information of the universe, he was thinking of it in relationship with the Supreme Lord, and therefore such geographical knowledge was not material but transcendental. Elsewhere in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.20) N\u0101rada Muni has said, ida\u1e41 hi vi\u015bva\u1e41 bhagav\u0101n ivetara\u1e25: the entire universe is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although it appears different from Him. Therefore although Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had no need for geographical knowledge of this universe, that knowledge was also spiritual and transcendental because he was thinking of the entire universe as an expansion of the energy of the Lord. In our preaching work also, we deal with so much property and money and so many books bought and sold, but because these dealings all pertain to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, they should never be considered material. That one is absorbed in thoughts of such management does not mean that he is outside of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one rigidly observes the regulative principle of chanting sixteen rounds of the mah\u0101-mantra every day, his dealings with the material world for the sake of spreading the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement are not different from the spiritual cultivation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "translation": "The great \u1e5b\u1e63i \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b said: My dear King, there is no limit to the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s material energy. This material world is a transformation of the material qualities [sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a], yet no one could possibly explain it perfectly, even in a lifetime as long as that of Brahm\u0101. No one in the material world is perfect, and an imperfect person could not describe this material universe accurately, even after continued speculation. O King, I shall nevertheless try to explain to you the principal regions, such as Bh\u016bloka, with their names, forms, measurements and various symptoms.",
        "purport": " The material world is only one fourth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s creation, but it is unlimited and impossible for anyone to know or describe, even with the qualification of a life as long as that of Brahm\u0101, who lives for millions and millions of years. Modern scientists and astronomers try to explain the cosmic situation and the vastness of space, and some of them believe that all the glittering stars are different suns. From Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, however, we understand that all these stars (nak\u1e63atras) are like the moon, in that they reflect the sunshine. They are not independent luminaries. Bh\u016bloka is explained to be that portion of outer space through which the heat and light of the sun extend. Therefore it is natural to conclude that this universe extends in space as far as we can see and encompasses the glittering stars. \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b admitted that to give full details of this expansive material universe would be impossible, but nevertheless he wanted to give the King as much knowledge as he had received through the parampar\u0101 system. We should conclude that if one cannot comprehend the material expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one certainly cannot estimate the expansiveness of the spiritual world. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.33) confirms this: The limits of the expansions of Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot be estimated by anyone, even a person as perfect as Brahm\u0101, not to speak of tiny scientists whose senses and instruments are all imperfect and who cannot give us information of even this one universe. We should therefore be satisfied with the information obtainable from Vedic sources as spoken by authorities like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b."

The measurements given herein, such as 10,000 yojanas or 100,000 yojanas, should be considered correct because they have been given by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b.

The denizens of heaven use this gold for various kinds of ornaments. Therefore all the inhabitants of the heavenly planets and their youthful wives are fully decorated with golden helmets, bangles and belts, and thus they enjoy life.",
        "purport": " By the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the rivers on some planets produce gold on their banks. The poor inhabitants of this earth, because of their incomplete knowledge, are captivated by a so-called bhagav\u0101n who can produce a small quantity of gold. However, it is understood that in a higher planetary system in this material world, the mud on the banks of the Jamb\u016b-nad\u012b mixes with jamb\u016b juice, reacts with the sunshine in the air, and automatically produces huge quantities of gold. Thus the men and women are decorated there by various golden ornaments, and they look very nice. Unfortunately, on earth there is such a scarcity of gold that the governments of the world try to keep it in reserve and issue paper currency. Because that currency is not backed up by gold, the paper they distribute as money is worthless, but nevertheless the people on earth are very proud of material advancement. In modern times, girls and ladies have ornaments made of plastic instead of gold, and plastic utensils are used instead of golden ones, yet people are very proud of their material wealth. Therefore the people of this age are described as mand\u0101\u1e25 sumanda-matayo manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101 hy upadrut\u0101\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 1.1.10). In other words, they are extremely bad and slow to understand the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They have been described as sumanda-mataya\u1e25 because their conceptions are so crippled that they accept a bluffer who produces a little gold to be God. Because they have no gold in their possession, they are actually poverty-stricken, and therefore they are considered unfortunate. Sometimes these unfortunate people want to be promoted to the heavenly planets to achieve fortunate positions, as described in this verse, but pure devotees of the Lord are not at all interested in such opulence. Indeed, devotees sometimes compare the color of gold to that of bright golden stool. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has instructed devotees not to be allured by golden ornaments and beautifully decorated women. Na dhana\u1e41 na jana\u1e41 na sundar\u012bm: a devotee should not be allured by gold, beautiful women or the prestige of having many followers. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, therefore, confidentially prayed, mama janmani janman\u012b\u015bvare bhavat\u0101d bhaktir ahaituk\u012b tvayi: \u201cMy Lord, please bless Me with Your devotional service. I do not want anything else.\u201d A devotee may pray to be delivered from this material world. That is his only aspiration. The humble devotee simply prays to the Lord, \u201cKindly pick me up from the material world, which is full of varieties of material opulence, and keep me under the shelter of Your lotus feet.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura prays: \u201cO my Lord, O son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, now You are standing before me with Your consort, the daughter of V\u1e5b\u1e63abh\u0101nu, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. Kindly accept me as the dust of Your lotus feet. Please do not kick me away, for I have no other shelter.\u201d Similarly, Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b indicates that the position of the demigods, who are decorated with golden helmets and other ornaments, is no better than a phantasmagoria (tri-da\u015ba-p\u016br \u0101k\u0101\u015ba-pu\u1e63p\u0101yate). A devotee is never allured by such opulences. He simply aspires to become the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord."

These rivers flow down from the top of the mountain to the northern side of Il\u0101v\u1e5bta-var\u1e63a for the benefit of those who live there. Because of these flowing rivers, all the people have ample supplies of milk, yogurt, honey, clarified butter [ghee], molasses, food grains, clothes, bedding, sitting places and ornaments. All the objects they desire are sufficiently supplied for their prosperity, and therefore they are very happy.",
        "purport": " The prosperity of humanity does not depend on a demoniac civilization that has no culture and no knowledge but has only gigantic skyscrapers and huge automobiles always rushing down the highways. The products of nature are sufficient. When there is a profuse supply of milk, yogurt, honey, food grains, ghee, molasses, dhotis, saris, bedding, sitting places and ornaments, the residents are actually opulent. When a profuse supply of water from the river inundates the land, all these things can be produced, and there will not be scarcity. This all depends, however, on the performance of sacrifice as described in the Vedic literature. \u201cAll living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by performance of yaj\u00f1a [sacrifice], and yaj\u00f1a is born of prescribed duties.\u201d These are the prescriptions given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.14). If people follow these principles in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, human society will be prosperous, and they will be happy both in this life and in the next."

Abundant honey can be obtained if the forests are protected. Unfortunately, in modern civilization, men are busy killing the cows that are the source of yogurt, milk and ghee, they are cutting down all the trees that supply honey, and they are opening factories to manufacture nuts, bolts, automobiles and wine instead of engaging in agriculture. How can the people be happy? They must suffer from all the misery of materialism. Their bodies become wrinkled and gradually deteriorate until they become almost like dwarves, and a bad odor emanates from their bodies because of unclean perspiration resulting from eating all kinds of nasty things.
