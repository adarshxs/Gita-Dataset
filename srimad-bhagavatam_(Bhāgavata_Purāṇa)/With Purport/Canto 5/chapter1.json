        "translation": "King Par\u012bk\u1e63it inquired from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b: O great sage, why did King Priyavrata, who was a great, self-realized devotee of the Lord, remain in household life, which is the root cause of the bondage of karma [fruitive activities] and which defeats the mission of human life?",
        "purport": " In the Fourth Canto, \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b explains that N\u0101rada Muni perfectly instructed King Priyavrata about the mission of human life. The mission of human life is to realize one\u2019s self and then gradually to go back home, back to Godhead. Since N\u0101rada Muni instructed the King fully on this subject, why did he again enter household life, which is the main cause of material bondage? Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was greatly astonished that King Priyavrata remained in household life, especially since he was not only a self-realized soul but also a first-class devotee of the Lord. A devotee actually has no attraction for household life, but surprisingly, King Priyavrata enjoyed household life very much. One may argue, \u201cWhy is it wrong to enjoy household life?\u201d The reply is that in household life one becomes bound by the results of fruitive activities. The essence of household life is sense enjoyment, and as long as one engrosses his mind in working hard for sense enjoyment, one becomes bound by the reactions of fruitive activities. This ignorance of self-realization is the greatest defeat in human life. The human form of life is especially meant for getting out of the bondage of fruitive activities, but as long as one is forgetful of his life\u2019s mission and acts like an ordinary animal \u2014 eating, sleeping, mating and defending \u2014 he must continue his conditioned life of material existence. Such a life is called svar\u016bpa-vism\u1e5bti, forgetfulness of one\u2019s real constitutional position. Therefore in Vedic civilization one is trained in the very beginning of life as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b must execute austerities and refrain from sex indulgence. Therefore if one is completely trained in the principles of brahmacarya, he generally does not enter household life. He is then called a nai\u1e63\u1e6dhika-brahmac\u0101r\u012b, which indicates total celibacy. King Par\u012bk\u1e63it was thus astonished that the great King Priyavrata, although trained in the principles of nai\u1e63\u1e6dhika-brahmacarya, entered household life. The words bh\u0101gavata \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma\u1e25 are very significant in this verse. If one is self-satisfied as is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is called bh\u0101gavata \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma\u1e25. There are different types of satisfaction. Karm\u012bs are satisfied in their fruitive activities, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are satisfied to merge into the effulgence of Brahman, and devotees are satisfied to engage in the Lord\u2019s service. The Lord is self-satisfied because He is fully opulent, and one who is satisfied by serving Him is called bh\u0101gavata \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma\u1e25. Manu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 sahasre\u1e63u: out of many thousands of persons, one may endeavor for liberation, and of many thousands of persons attempting to become liberated, one may achieve liberation from the anxieties of material existence and become self-satisfied. Even that satisfaction, however, is not the ultimate satisfaction. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and the karm\u012bs have desires, as do the yog\u012bs, but devotees have no desires. Satisfaction in the service of the Lord is called ak\u0101ma, freedom from desire, and this is the ultimate satisfaction. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it inquired, \u201cHow could one who was fully satisfied on the highest platform be satisfied with family life?\u201d The word par\u0101bhava\u1e25 in this verse is also significant. When one is satisfied in family life, he is doomed because he must already have forgotten his relationship with the Lord. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja describes how the activities of family life implicate one more and more. \u0100tma-p\u0101ta\u1e41 g\u1e5bham andha-k\u016bpam: household life is like a dark well. If one falls into this well, his spiritual death is assured. How Priyavrata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja remained a liberated paramaha\u1e41sa even within family life is described in text 23 of this chapter."

        "purport": " In Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu it is said that by executing devotional service to the Lord, one can understand the transcendental position of the living being and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be understood by any means except bhakti. The Lord confirms this in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.14.21). Bhakty\u0101ham ekay\u0101 gr\u0101hya\u1e25: \u201conly by executing devotional service can one appreciate Me.\u201d Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti: \u201csimply by discharging devotional service, one can understand Me.\u201d Thus for a bhakta to become attached to family affairs is impossible, since a bhakta and his associates are liberated. Everyone is searching after \u0101nanda, or bliss, but in the material world there can never be any bliss. It is only possible in devotional service. Attachment for family affairs and devotional service are incompatible. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was somewhat surprised to hear that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata was simultaneously attached to devotional service and to family life."

        "translation": "\u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b said: What you have said is correct. The glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is praised in eloquent, transcendental verses by such exalted personalities as Brahm\u0101, are very pleasing to great devotees and liberated persons. One who is attached to the nectarean honey of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, and whose mind is always absorbed in His glories, may sometimes be checked by some impediment, but he still never gives up the exalted position he has acquired.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b accepted both of the King\u2019s propositions \u2014 that a person who is advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot embrace materialistic life again and that one who has embraced materialistic life cannot take up K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness at any stage of his existence. Although accepting both these statements, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b qualified them by saying that a person who has once absorbed his mind in the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead may sometimes be influenced by impediments but he still does not give up his exalted devotional position. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, there are two kinds of impediments to devotional service. The first is an offense at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. This is called vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dha. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu warned His devotees not to commit vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dha, which He described as the mad elephant offense. When a mad elephant enters a beautiful garden, it destroys everything, leaving a barren field. Similarly, the power of vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dha is so great that even an advanced devotee becomes almost devoid of his spiritual assets if he commits it. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is eternal, it cannot be destroyed altogether, but advancement may be checked for the time being. Thus vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dha is one kind of impediment to devotional service. Sometimes, however, the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee desires to impede one\u2019s devotional service. For example, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a were formerly Jaya and Vijaya, the gatekeepers in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, but by the desire of the Lord they became His enemies for three lives. Thus the desire of the Lord is another kind of impediment. But in both cases, the pure devotee, once advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, cannot be lost. Following the orders of his superiors (Sv\u0101yambhuva and Lord Brahm\u0101), Priyavrata accepted family life, but this did not mean he lost his position in devotional service. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is perfect and eternal, and therefore it cannot be lost under any circumstances. Because the material world is full of obstructions to advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there may appear to be many impediments, yet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, declares in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.31), kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati: once one has taken shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, he cannot be lost. In this verse, the word \u015bivatam\u0101m is very significant. \u015aivatam\u0101m means \u201cthe most auspicious.\u201d The devotional path is so auspicious that a devotee cannot be lost under any circumstances. This is described in the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the Lord Himself. P\u0101rtha naiveha n\u0101mutra vin\u0101\u015bas tasya vidyate: \u201cMy dear Arjuna, for a devotee there is no question of being lost, either in this life or in the next.\u201d (Bg. 6.40) In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.43) the Lord clearly explains how this is so. By the order of the Lord, a perfect devotee sometimes comes to this material world like an ordinary human being. Because of his previous practice, such a perfect devotee naturally becomes attached to devotional service, apparently without cause. Despite all kinds of impediments due to surrounding circumstances, he automatically perseveres in devotional service and gradually advances until he once again becomes perfect. Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura had been an advanced devotee in his previous life, but in his next life he became greatly fallen and was attached to a prostitute. Suddenly, however, his entire behavior was changed by the words of the very prostitute who had so much attracted him, and he became a great devotee. In the lives of exalted devotees, there are many such instances, proving that once one has taken to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord he cannot be lost (kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati). The fact is, however, that one becomes a devotee when he is completely freed from all reactions to sinful life. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.28): \u201cPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of illusion engage themselves in My service with determination.\u201d On the other hand, as Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said: A person who is too attached to materialistic family life \u2014 home, family, wife, children and so on \u2014 cannot develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. These apparent contradictions are resolved in the life of a devotee by the grace of the Supreme Lord, and therefore a devotee is never bereft of his position on the path of liberation, which is described in this verse as \u015bivatam\u0101\u1e41 padav\u012bm."

        "translation": "\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continued: My dear King, Prince Priyavrata was a great devotee because he sought the lotus feet of N\u0101rada, his spiritual master, and thus achieved the highest perfection in transcendental knowledge. With advanced knowledge, he always engaged in discussing spiritual subjects and did not divert his attention to anything else. The Prince\u2019s father then asked him to take charge of ruling the world. He tried to convince Priyavrata that this was his duty as indicated in the revealed scriptures. Prince Priyavrata, however, was continuously practicing bhakti-yoga by constantly remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thus engaging all his senses in the service of the Lord. Therefore, although the order of his father could not be rejected, the Prince did not welcome it. Thus he very conscientiously raised the question of whether he might be diverted from devotional service by accepting the responsibility of ruling over the world.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has sung, ch\u0101\u1e0diy\u0101 vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-sev\u0101 nist\u0101ra p\u0101yeche keb\u0101: \u201cWithout serving the lotus feet of a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava or spiritual master, no one has ever attained perfect liberation from material bondage.\u201d Prince Priyavrata regularly served the lotus feet of N\u0101rada, and thus the Prince perfectly understood transcendental subjects in truth (sa-tattva\u1e25). The word sa-tattva\u1e25 means that Priyavrata knew all the facts about the spirit soul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the relationship between the spirit soul and the Supreme Personality of Godhead and he also knew all about this material world and the relationship of the spirit soul and the Supreme Lord within the material world. Thus the Prince decided to engage himself only in rendering service to the Lord. When Priyavrata\u2019s father, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, requested him to accept the responsibility of ruling over the world, he did not welcome the suggestion. This is the symptom of a great, liberated devotee. Even though engaged in worldly affairs, he does not take pleasure in them, but remains always absorbed in the Lord\u2019s service. While thus serving the Lord, he deals externally with worldly affairs without being affected. For example, although he has no attraction for his children, he cares for them and educates them to become devotees. Similarly, he speaks to his wife with affectionate words, but he is not attached to her. By rendering devotional service, a devotee acquires all the good qualities of the Supreme Lord. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had sixteen thousand wives, all of them very beautiful, and although He dealt with each of them as a beloved husband, He was not attracted or attached to any of them. In the same way, although a devotee may enter family life and act very affectionately toward his wife and children, he is never attached to these activities. This verse states that by serving the lotus feet of his spiritual master, Prince Priyavrata very soon attained the perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is the only way to advance in spiritual life. As stated in the Vedas: \u201cIf one has unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord and the spiritual master, the essence of all Vedic knowledge is revealed to him. (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23) A devotee always thinks of the Lord continuously. While chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, the words K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Hare immediately remind him of all the Lord\u2019s activities. Since his entire life is engaged in the service of the Lord, a devotee cannot forget the Lord at any time. Just as an ordinary man always engages his mind in material activities, a devotee always engages his mind in spiritual activities. This is called brahma-satra, or meditating upon the Supreme Lord always. Prince Priyavrata was perfectly initiated into this practice by \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada."

        "translation": "\u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continued: The first created being and most powerful demigod in this universe is Lord Brahm\u0101, who is always responsible for developing universal affairs. Born directly from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he dedicates his activities to the welfare of the entire universe, for he knows the purpose of the universal creation. This supremely powerful Lord Brahm\u0101, accompanied by his associates and the personified Vedas, left his own abode in the highest planetary system and descended to the place of Prince Priyavrata\u2019s meditation.",
        "purport": " Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Self (\u0101tm\u0101), is the source of everything, as explained in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra: janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25. Because Brahm\u0101 was born directly from Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he is called \u0101tma-yoni. He is also called bhagav\u0101n, although generally bhagav\u0101n refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a). Sometimes great personalities \u2014 such as demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101, N\u0101rada or Lord \u015aiva \u2014 are also addressed as bhagav\u0101n because they carry out the purpose of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Brahm\u0101 is called bhagav\u0101n because he is the secondary creator of this universe. He is always thinking of how to improve the situation of the conditioned souls who have come to the material world to enjoy material activities. For this reason, he disseminates the Vedic knowledge throughout the universe for everyone\u2019s guidance. Vedic knowledge is divided into two parts: prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga and niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga. Niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga is the path of negating sense enjoyment, and prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga is the path by which the living entities are given a chance to enjoy and at the same time are directed in such a way that they can go back home, back to Godhead. Because ruling over this universe is a great responsibility, Brahm\u0101 must force many Manus in different ages to take charge of universal affairs. Under each Manu there are different kings who also execute the purpose of Lord Brahm\u0101. It is understood from previous explanations that the father of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, King Utt\u0101nap\u0101da, ruled over the universe because his elder brother, Priyavrata, practiced austerity from the very beginning of his life. Thus up to the point of the Pracet\u0101s, the kings of the universe were all descendants of Utt\u0101nap\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Since there were no suitable kings after the Pracet\u0101s, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu went to the Gandham\u0101dana Hill to bring back his eldest son, Priyavrata, who was meditating there. Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu requested Priyavrata to rule over the universe. When he refused, Lord Brahm\u0101 descended from the supreme planetary system, known as Satyaloka, to request Priyavrata to accept the order. Lord Brahm\u0101 did not come alone. He came with other great sages like Mar\u012bci, \u0100treya and Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. To convince Priyavrata that it was necessary for him to follow the Vedic injunctions and accept the responsibility of ruling over the world, Lord Brahm\u0101 also brought with him the personified Vedas, his constant associates. A significant word in this verse is sva-bhavan\u0101t, indicating that Lord Brahm\u0101 descended from his own abode. Every demigod has his own abode. Indra, the King of the demigods, has his own abode, as do Candra, the lord of the moon planet, and S\u016brya, the predominating deity of the sun planet. There are many millions of demigods, and the stars and planets are their respective homes. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n: \u201cThose who worship the demigods go to their different planetary systems.\u201d Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s abode. the highest planetary system, is called Satyaloka or sometimes Brahmaloka. Brahmaloka usually refers to the spiritual world. The abode of Lord Brahm\u0101 is Satyaloka, but because Lord Brahm\u0101 resides there, it is also sometimes called Brahmaloka."

        "purport": " It appears from this description that there is regular interplanetary travel between the planets of the demigods. Another significant point is that there is a planet covered mostly by great mountains, one of which is Gandham\u0101dana Hill. Three great personalities \u2014 Priyavrata, N\u0101rada and Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu \u2014 were sitting on this hill. According to Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, each universe is filled with different planetary systems, and every system has a unique opulence. For example, on Siddhaloka all the residents are very advanced in the powers of mystic yoga. They can fly from one planet to another without airplanes or other flying machines. Similarly, the residents of Gandharvaloka are expert in musical science, and those on S\u0101dhyaloka are all great saints. The interplanetary system undoubtedly exists, and residents of different planets may go from one to another. On this earth, however, we have not invented any machine that can go directly from one planet to another, although an unsuccessful attempt has been made to go directly to the moon."

        "translation": "My dear King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, because Lord Brahm\u0101 had finally descended from Satyaloka to Bh\u016bloka, N\u0101rada Muni, Prince Priyavrata and Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu came forward to offer him objects of worship and to praise him in highly qualified language, according to Vedic etiquette. At that time, Lord Brahm\u0101, the original person of this universe, felt compassion for Priyavrata and, looking upon him with a smiling face, spoke to him as follows.",
        "purport": " That Lord Brahm\u0101 descended from Satyaloka to see Priyavrata indicates that the matter was very serious. N\u0101rada Muni had come to advise Priyavrata about the value of spiritual life, knowledge, renunciation and bhakti, and Lord Brahm\u0101 knew that N\u0101rada\u2019s instructions were very impressive. Therefore unless Lord Brahm\u0101 personally went to Gandham\u0101dana Hill to request Priyavrata, Lord Brahm\u0101 knew that Prince Priyavrata would not accept his father\u2019s order. Brahm\u0101\u2019s purpose was to break Priyavrata\u2019s determination. Therefore Brahm\u0101 first looked upon Priyavrata with compassion. His smile and compassionate features also indicated that although Brahm\u0101 would request Priyavrata to accept household life, Priyavrata would not be out of touch with devotional service. By the blessings of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, everything is possible. This is described in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu as k\u1e5bp\u0101-siddhi, or perfection attained simply by the blessings of a superior person. One usually becomes liberated and perfect by executing the regulative principles set down in the \u015b\u0101stras. Nonetheless, many persons have achieved perfection simply by the blessings of a spiritual master or superior. Priyavrata was the grandson of Lord Brahm\u0101, and as joking competition sometimes takes place between grandson and grandfather, in this case also Priyavrata was determined to remain in meditation, whereas Brahm\u0101 was determined that he rule the universe. Thus Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s affectionate smile and glance meant, \u201cMy dear Priyavrata, you have decided not to accept household life, but I have decided to convince you that you must accept it.\u201d Actually, Brahm\u0101 had come to praise Priyavrata for his high standard of renunciation, austerity, penance and devotion so that he would not be deviated from devotional service, even though he would accept household life. In this verse, one important word is s\u016bkta-v\u0101kena (by Vedic hymns). In the Vedas, there is the following prayer to Lord Brahm\u0101: hira\u1e47yagarbha\u1e25 samavartat\u0101gre bh\u016btasya j\u0101ta\u1e25 patir eka \u0101s\u012bt. Brahm\u0101 was received with the appropriate Vedic hymns, and because he was welcomed according to the Vedic etiquette, he was very pleased."

        "translation": "Lord Brahm\u0101, the supreme person within this universe, said: My dear Priyavrata, kindly hear attentively what I shall say to you. Do not be jealous of the Supreme Lord, who is beyond our experimental measurements. All of us, including Lord \u015aiva, your father and the great sage Mah\u0101r\u1e63i N\u0101rada, must carry out the order of the Supreme. We cannot deviate from His order.",
        "purport": " Of the twelve great authorities in devotional service, four \u2014 Lord Brahm\u0101 himself, his son N\u0101rada, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu and Lord \u015aiva \u2014 were present before Priyavrata. They were accompanied by many other authoritative sages. Brahm\u0101 first wanted to impress upon Priyavrata that although these great personalities are all authorities, they cannot possibly disobey the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described in this verse as deva, which means \u201calways glorious.\u201d The power, glory and potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can never be diminished. In the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad, the Lord is described as ap\u0101pa-viddha, which indicates that He is never affected by anything materially considered sinful. Similarly, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam describes the Supreme Personality of Godhead as being so powerful that nothing we might consider abominable can affect Him. An example sometimes given to explain the position of the Supreme Lord is that of the sun, which evaporates urine from the earth but is never affected by contamination. The Supreme Lord can never be accused of doing anything wrong. When Lord Brahm\u0101 went to induce Priyavrata to accept the responsibility for ruling the universe, he did not go whimsically; he was following the dictations of the Supreme Lord. Indeed, Brahm\u0101 and other genuine authorities never do anything without His permission. The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart. In the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said, tene brahma h\u1e5bd\u0101 ya \u0101di-kavaye: the Lord dictated Vedic knowledge to Brahm\u0101 through his heart. The more a living entity is purified by devotional service, the more he comes in direct contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d (Bg. 10.10) Lord Brahm\u0101, therefore, had not come to Priyavrata by his own whims: rather, it is understood that he had been ordered to persuade Priyavrata by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose activities cannot be understood by material senses and who is therefore described herein as aprameya. Thus Lord Brahm\u0101 first advised Priyavrata to hear his words with attention and without envy. Why one is induced to perform certain acts despite his desire to do something else is indicated herein. One cannot disobey the orders of the Supreme Lord, even if one is as powerful as Lord \u015aiva, Lord Brahm\u0101, Manu or the great sage N\u0101rada. All these authorities are certainly very powerful, but they do not have the power to disobey the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since Lord Brahm\u0101 had come to Priyavrata in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Lord, he first wanted to dispel any suspicions that he might be acting as Priyavrata\u2019s enemy. Lord Brahm\u0101 was following the orders of the Supreme Lord, and therefore it would be worthwhile for Priyavrata to accept Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s order, as the Lord desired."

        "purport": " In the B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (3.8.9), Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya says to G\u0101rg\u012b, the daughter of Garga Muni, etasya v\u0101 ak\u1e63arasya pra\u015b\u0101sane gargi s\u016bry\u0101-candramasau vidh\u1e5btau ti\u1e63\u1e6dhata\u1e25: \u201cMy dear G\u0101rg\u012b, everything is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the sun, the moon and other controllers and demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101 and King Indra are all under His control.\u201d An ordinary human being or animal who has accepted a material body cannot go beyond the jurisdiction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s control. A material body includes senses. However, the sense activities of so-called scientists who try to be free from God\u2019s law or the laws of nature are useless. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14). Mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101: it is impossible to surpass the control of material nature, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead is working behind it. Sometimes we are proud of our austerities, penances and mystic yogic powers, but it is clearly stated herein that one cannot surpass the laws and directions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, either by dint of mystic power, a scientific education, or austerities and penances. It is impossible. The word man\u012b\u1e63ay\u0101 (\u201cby intelligence\u201d) is of special significance. Priyavrata might argue that Lord Brahm\u0101 was requesting him to accept family life and the responsibility for ruling a kingdom although N\u0101rada Muni had advised him not to enter household life and be entangled in material affairs. Whom to accept would be a puzzle for Priyavrata because both Lord Brahm\u0101 and N\u0101rada Muni are authorities. Under the circumstances, the use of the word man\u012b\u1e63ay\u0101 is very appropriate, for it indicates that since both N\u0101rada Muni and Lord Brahm\u0101 are authorized to give instruction, Priyavrata should neglect neither of them but should use his intelligence to follow the advice of both. To solve such dilemmas, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has given a very clear conception of intelligence. He says: Vi\u1e63ay\u0101n, material affairs, should be accepted without attachment, and everything should be dovetailed with the service of the Lord. That is real intelligence (man\u012b\u1e63\u0101). Becoming a family man or king in the material world is not harmful if one accepts everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. That necessitates clear intelligence. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers say, brahma satya\u1e41 jagan mithy\u0101: this material world is false, and only the Absolute Truth is real. However, an intelligent devotee in the line of Lord Brahm\u0101 and the great sage N\u0101rada \u2014 or, in other words, in the Brahma-samprad\u0101ya \u2014 does not consider this world false. That which is created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be false, but using it for enjoyment is. Everything is meant to be enjoyed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29). Bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme proprietor and enjoyer, and therefore everything should be dovetailed for His enjoyment and service. Regardless of one\u2019s circumstances, favorable or unfavorable, one should use everything to serve the Supreme Lord. That is the perfect way to use one\u2019s intelligence."

        "translation": "My dear boy, all of us are bound by the Vedic injunctions to the divisions of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama according to our qualities and work. These divisions are difficult to avoid because they are scientifically arranged. We must therefore carry out our duties of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, like bulls obliged to move according to the direction of a driver pulling on ropes knotted to their noses.",
        "purport": " In this verse, the words tanty\u0101\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-d\u0101mabhi\u1e25 are very important. We each get a body according to our association with the gu\u1e47as, the qualities or modes of material nature, and we act accordingly. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the four orders of the social system \u2014 namely br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra \u2014 are arranged according to gu\u1e47a and karma, their qualities and work. There is some controversy about this, however, because some say that since one receives a body according to the gu\u1e47a and karma of his past life, it is one\u2019s birth that determines his social status. Others say, however, that one\u2019s birth according to the gu\u1e47a and karma of his past life is not the essential consideration, since one can change his gu\u1e47a and karma even in this life. Thus they say that the four divisions of the social order \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra \u2014 should be arranged according to the gu\u1e47a and karma of this life. This version is confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam by N\u0101rada Muni. While instructing Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira about the symptoms of gu\u1e47a and karma, N\u0101rada Muni said that these symptoms must govern the division of society. In other words, if a person born in the family of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a has the symptoms of a \u015b\u016bdra, he should be designated as a \u015b\u016bdra. Similarly, if a \u015b\u016bdra has brahminical qualities, he should be designated a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system is scientific. Therefore if we accept the divisions of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama according to the Vedic instructions, our lives will be successful. Unless human society is thus divided and arranged, it cannot be perfect. As stated in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (3.8.9): \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is worshiped by the proper execution of prescribed duties in the system of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama. There is no other way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One must be situated in the institution of the four var\u1e47as and \u0101\u015bramas.\u201d All of human society is meant to worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. At the present moment, however, human society does not know that this is the ultimate goal or perfection of life. Therefore instead of worshiping Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, people have been educated to worship matter. According to the direction of modern society, men think they can advance in civilization by manipulating matter to build skyscrapers, big roads, automobiles and so on. Such a civilization must certainly be called materialistic because its people do not know the goal of life. The goal of life is to reach Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but instead of reaching Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, people are bewildered by the external manifestation of the material energy. Therefore progress in material advancement is blind, and the leaders of such material advancement are also blind. They are leading their followers in the wrong way. It is best, therefore, to accept the injunctions of the Vedas, which are mentioned in this verse as yad-v\u0101ci. In accordance with those injunctions, everyone should find out whether he is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra and should thus be educated accordingly. Then his life will be successful. Otherwise, all of human society will be confused. If human society is divided scientifically according to var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama, and if the Vedic directions are followed, one\u2019s life, regardless of his position, will be successful. It is not that br\u0101hma\u1e47as will be elevated to the transcendental platform but not the \u015b\u016bdras. If the Vedic injunctions are followed, all of them \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras \u2014 will be elevated to the transcendental platform, and their lives will be successful. The injunctions in the Vedas are explicit directions from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example cited in this verse is that bulls tied by ropes in their nostrils move according to the direction of the driver. Similarly, if we move according to the instructions of the Vedas, the perfect paths for our lives will be set. Otherwise, if we do not move in that way but act according to our whimsical ideas, our lives will be spoiled by confusion and will end in despair. Actually, because people at the present moment are not following the instructions of the Vedas, they are all confused. We must therefore accept this instruction by Lord Brahm\u0101 to Priyavrata as the factual scientific direction leading to the success of life. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.23): If we do not live according to the injunctions of the \u015b\u0101stras, the Vedas, we shall never achieve success in life, to say nothing of happiness or elevation to higher statuses of living."

        "translation": "My dear Priyavrata, according to our association with different modes of material nature, the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives us our specific bodies and the happiness and distress we achieve. One must therefore remain situated as he is and be conducted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly as a blind man is led by a person who has eyes with which to see.",
        "purport": " By material means, one cannot avoid the happiness and distress unique to his particular body. There are 8,400,000 bodily forms, each destined to enjoy and suffer a certain amount of happiness and distress. This we cannot change, for the happiness and distress are ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in accordance with whose decision we have received our bodies. Since we cannot avoid the plan of the Supreme Godhead, we must agree to be directed by Him, just as a blind man is led by a person who has eyes. Under any circumstances, if we remain in the condition allotted to us by the Supreme Lord and follow His instructions, we will become perfect. The main purpose of life is to follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is such instructions that constitute one\u2019s religion or occupational duty. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, therefore, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: \u201cGive up all other engagements. Simply surrender unto Me and follow Me.\u201d (Bg. 18.66) This process of surrendering by following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not meant for any particular caste or creed. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a can surrender, and so can a k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra. Everyone can adopt this process. As stated in this verse, cak\u1e63u\u1e63mat\u0101ndh\u0101 iva n\u012byam\u0101n\u0101\u1e25: one should follow the Lord the way a blind man follows a person who has eyes. If we follow the Supreme Personality of Godhead by following the directions He gives in the Vedas and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, our lives will be successful. The Lord therefore says: \u201cAlways think of Me, become My devotee, and offer respect and obeisances unto Me. Then you will certainly come back home, back to Godhead. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.\u201d (Bg. 18.65) This instruction is meant for everyone \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra. If anyone, from any division of life, surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and follows His instructions, his life will be successful. The previous verse has given the analogy of bulls moving under the direction of the driver of a bullock cart. The bulls, being completely surrendered to the driver, remain wherever he wants to place them and eat whatever he wants them to eat. Similarly, being completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we should not aspire for happiness, or regret distress; we must be satisfied with the position allotted to us by the Lord. We should follow the path of devotional service and not be dissatisfied with the happiness and distress He has given. People in the material modes of passion and ignorance generally cannot understand the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with its 8,400,000 forms of life, but the human form affords one the special privilege to understand this plan, engage in devotional service and elevate oneself to the highest position of perfection by following the Lord\u2019s instructions. The entire world is working under the influence of the modes of material nature, especially ignorance and passion, but if people engage in hearing and chanting about the glories of the Supreme Lord, their lives can be successful, and they can be elevated to the highest perfection. In the B\u1e5bhan-n\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a, therefore, it is said: \u201cIn this Age of Kali, there is no other way, no other way, no other way for spiritual perfection than the holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord.\u201d Everyone should be given the chance to hear the holy names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for thus one will gradually come to understand his real position in life and be elevated to the transcendental position above the mode of goodness. Thus all impediments to his progress will be cut to pieces. In conclusion, therefore, we must be satisfied in whatever position we have been put into by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we should try to engage ourselves in His devotional service. Then our lives will be successful."

        "translation": "Even if one is liberated, he nevertheless accepts the body he has received according to his past karma. Without misconceptions, however, he regards his enjoyment and suffering due to that karma the way an awakened person regards a dream he had while sleeping. He thus remains steadfast and never works to achieve another material body under the influence of the three modes of material nature.",
        "purport": " The difference between a liberated and conditioned soul is that the conditioned soul is under the concept of bodily life whereas a liberated person knows that he is not the body but a spirit, different from the body. Priyavrata might have thought that although a conditioned soul is forced to act according to the laws of nature, why should he, who was far advanced in spiritual understanding, accept the same kind of bondage and impediments to spiritual advancement? To answer this doubt, Lord Brahm\u0101 informed him that even those who are liberated do not resent accepting, in the present body, the results of their past activities. While sleeping, one dreams many unreal things, but when he awakens he disregards them and makes progress in factual life. Similarly, a liberated person \u2014 one who has completely understood that he is not the body but a spirit soul \u2014 disregards past activities performed in ignorance and performs his present activities in such a way that they produce no reactions. This is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9). Yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25: if one performs activities for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality, the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, his work does not produce reactions, whereas karm\u012bs, who act for themselves, are bound by the reactions of their work. A liberated person, therefore, does not think about whatever he has ignorantly done in the past; instead, he acts in such a way that he will not produce another body by fruitive activities. As clearly mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d (Bg. 14.26) Regardless of what we have done in our past lives, if we engage ourselves in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord in this life, we will always be situated in the brahma-bh\u016bta (liberated) state, free from reactions, and will not be obliged to accept another material body. Tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so\u00a0\u2019rjuna (Bg. 4.9). After giving up the body, one who has acted in that way does not accept another material body, but instead goes back home, back to Godhead."

Here this is also repeated. For one who has not controlled his senses, going to the forest to become a so-called yog\u012b is meaningless. Because his uncontrolled mind and senses are going with him, he cannot achieve anything, even by giving up household life and staying in the forest. Formerly many mercantile men from the up-country of India used to go to Bengal, and thus there is a familiar saying, \u201cIf you go to Bengal, your fortune will go with you.\u201d Our first concern, therefore, should be to control the senses, and since the senses cannot be controlled unless engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, our most important duty is to engage the senses in devotional service. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate: bhakti means engagement of the purified senses in the service of the Lord. Herein Lord Brahm\u0101 indicates that instead of going to the forest with uncontrolled senses, it is better and more secure to engage the senses in the service of the Lord. Even household life can do no harm to a self-controlled person acting in this way; it cannot force him into material bondage. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has further enunciated this position: \u201cRegardless of one\u2019s circumstances, if one fully engages his activities, mind and words in the devotional service of the Lord, he should be understood to be a liberated person.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura was a responsible officer and a householder, yet his service to the cause of expanding the mission of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is unique. \u015ar\u012bla Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says, durd\u0101ntendriya-k\u0101la-sarpa-pa\u1e6dal\u012b protkh\u0101ta-da\u1e41\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101yate. The sense organs are certainly our greatest enemies, and they are therefore compared to venomous serpents. However, if a venomous serpent is bereft of its poison fangs, it is no longer fearful.Similarly, if the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord, there is no need to fear their activities. The devotees in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement move within this material world, but because their senses are fully engaged in the service of the Lord, they are always aloof from the material world. They are always living in a transcendental position."

        "translation": "Lord Brahm\u0101 continued: My dear Priyavrata, seek shelter inside the opening in the lotus of the feet of the Lord, whose navel is also like a lotus. Thus conquer the six sense organs [the mind and knowledge-acquiring senses]. Accept material enjoyment because the Lord, extraordinarily, has ordered you to do this. You will thus always be liberated from material association and be able to carry out the Lord\u2019s orders in your constitutional position.",
        "purport": " There are three kinds of men within this material world. Those who are trying to enjoy the senses to the utmost are called karm\u012bs, above them are the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, who try to conquer the urges of the senses, and above them are the yog\u012bs, who have already conquered the senses. None of them, however, are situated in a transcendental position. Only devotees, who belong to none of the above-mentioned groups, are transcendental. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d Lord Brahm\u0101 herein advises Priyavrata to remain transcendental in the fortress not of family life but of the lotus feet of the Lord (abja-n\u0101bh\u0101\u1e45ghri-saroja). When a bumblebee enters the opening of a lotus flower and drinks its honey, it is fully protected by the petals of the lotus. The bee is undisturbed by sunshine and other external influences. Similarly, one who always seeks shelter at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead is protected from all dangers. It is therefore said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.58): For one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, everything becomes easier. Indeed, even crossing the great ocean of nescience (bhav\u0101mbudhi) is exactly like crossing the hoofprint created by a calf (vatsa-padam). For such a devotee, there is no question of remaining in a place where every step is dangerous. Our actual duty is to carry out the supreme order of the Personality of Godhead. If we are fixed in our determination to carry out the supreme order of the Lord, we are always secure, regardless of where we are situated, whether in hell or in heaven. Herein the words prak\u1e5bti\u1e41 bhajasva are very significant. Prak\u1e5btim refers to one\u2019s constitutional position. Every living entity has the constitutional position of being an eternal servant of God. Therefore Lord Brahm\u0101 advised Priyavrata, \u201cBe situated in your original position as an eternal servant of the Lord. If you carry out His orders, you will never fall, even in the midst of material enjoyment.\u201d Material enjoyment achieved by dint of one\u2019s fruitive activities differs from material enjoyment given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee sometimes appears to be in a very opulent position, but he accepts that position to follow the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore a devotee is never affected by material influences. The devotees in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement are preaching all over the world in accordance with the order of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. They have to meet many karm\u012bs, but by the mercy of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu they are unaffected by material influences. He has blessed them, as described in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 7.129): A sincere devotee who engages in the service of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu by preaching His cult all over the world will never be affected by vi\u1e63aya-tara\u1e45ga, material influences. On the contrary, in due course of time he will return to the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and will thus have perpetual association with Him."

The duty of a great devotee is to carry out the order of the spiritual master, or the spiritual master of the spiritual master in the parampar\u0101 system. As described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.2), eva\u1e41 parampar\u0101 pr\u0101ptam: one has to receive the instructions of the Supreme Lord through the disciplic chain of spiritual masters. A devotee of the Lord always considers himself a servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord."

Priyavrata and N\u0101rada also looked upon Brahm\u0101 with no tinges of resentment. Having engaged Priyavrata in accepting his father\u2019s request, Lord Brahm\u0101 returned to his abode, Satyaloka, which is indescribable by the endeavor of mundane mind or words.",
        "purport": " Manu was certainly very satisfied that Lord Brahm\u0101 had persuaded his son Priyavrata to take the responsibility for ruling the world. Priyavrata and N\u0101rada were also very satisfied. Although Brahm\u0101 had forced Priyavrata to accept the management of worldly affairs, thus breaking his vow to remain brahmac\u0101r\u012b and completely engage in devotional service, N\u0101rada and Priyavrata did not look upon Brahm\u0101 with resentment. N\u0101rada was not at all sorry that he had been frustrated in making Priyavrata a disciple. Both Priyavrata and N\u0101rada were exalted personalities who knew how to respect Lord Brahm\u0101. Therefore instead of looking upon Brahm\u0101 with resentment, they very feelingly offered him their respect. Lord Brahm\u0101 then returned to his celestial abode, known as Satyaloka, which is described here as being impeccable and being unapproachable by words. It is stated in this verse that Lord Brahm\u0101 returned to his residence, which is as important as his own personality. Lord Brahm\u0101 is the creator of this universe and the most exalted personality within it. His lifetime is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.17). Sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahma\u1e47o vidu\u1e25. The total duration of the four yugas is 4,300,000 years, and when that is multiplied a thousand times, it equals twelve hours in the life of Brahm\u0101. Therefore we cannot factually comprehend even twelve hours of Brahm\u0101\u2019s life, to say nothing of the one hundred years that constitute his entire lifetime. How, then, can we understand his abode? The Vedic literatures describe that in Satyaloka there is no birth, death, old age or disease. In other words, since Satyaloka is situated next to Brahmaloka, or the Brahman effulgence, it is almost as good as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s abode is practically indescribable from our present status. Therefore it has been described as av\u0101\u1e45-manasa-gocara, or beyond the description of our words and the imagination of our minds. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.2.26-27) thus describes the abode of Lord Brahm\u0101: yad dvai par\u0101rdhya\u1e41 tad u p\u0101rame\u1e63\u1e6dhya\u1e41 na yatra \u015boko na jar\u0101 na m\u1e5btyur n\u0101rtir na codvega\u1e25. \u201cIn Satyaloka, which is situated many millions and billions of years away, there is no lamentation, nor is there old age, death, anxiety or the influence of enemies.\u201d (SB. 2.2.26\u201427)"

With the permission of the great sage N\u0101rada, he delivered to his son the governmental responsibility for maintaining and protecting all the planets of the universe. He thus achieved relief from the most dangerous, poisonous ocean of material desires.",
        "purport": " Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu was practically hopeless because such a great personality as N\u0101rada was instructing his son Priyavrata not to accept household life. Now he was very pleased that Lord Brahm\u0101 had interfered by inducing his son to accept the responsibility for ruling the government of the universe. From Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we get information that Vaivasvata Manu was the son of the sun-god and that his son, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, ruled this planet earth. Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, however, appears to have been in charge of the entire universe, and he entrusted to his son, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata, the responsibility for maintaining and protecting all the planetary systems. Dhar\u0101-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala means \u201cplanet.\u201d This earth, for instance, is called dhar\u0101-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala. Akhila, however, means \u201call\u201d or \u201cuniversal.\u201d It is therefore difficult to understand where Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata was situated, but from this literature his position certainly appears greater than that of Vaivasvata Manu, for he was entrusted with all the planetary systems of the entire universe. Another significant statement is that Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu took great satisfaction from abnegating the responsibility for ruling all the planetary systems of the universe. At present, politicians are very eager to take charge of the government, and they engage their men in canvassing from door to door to get votes to win the post of president or a similar exalted office. On the contrary, however, herein we find that King Priyavrata had to be persuaded by Lord Brahm\u0101 to accept the post of emperor of the entire universe. Similarly, his father, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, felt relieved to entrust the universal government to Priyavrata. Thus it is evident that the kings and executive heads of government in the Vedic age never accepted their positions for sense enjoyment. Such exalted kings, who were known as r\u0101jar\u1e63is, ruled only to maintain and protect the kingdom for the welfare of the citizens. The history of Priyavrata and Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu describes how exemplary, responsible monarchs performed the duties of government with disinterest, keeping themselves always aloof from the contamination of material attachment. Material affairs have herein been compared to an ocean of poison. They have been described in a similar way by \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura in one of his songs: \u201cMy heart is always burning in the fire of material existence. and I have made no provisions for getting out of it.\u201d \u201cThe only remedy is hari-n\u0101ma-sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, which is imported from the spiritual world, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. How unfortunate I am that I have no attraction for this.\u201d Manu wanted to seek shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore when his son Priyavrata took charge of his worldly affairs, Manu was very relieved. That is the system of Vedic civilization. At the end of life, one must free himself from worldly affairs and completely engage in the service of the Lord. The word surar\u1e63i-vara-anumatena is also significant. Manu entrusted the government to his son with the permission of the great saint N\u0101rada. This is particularly mentioned because although N\u0101rada wanted Priyavrata to become free from all material affairs, when Priyavrata took charge of the universe by the request of Lord Brahm\u0101 and Manu, N\u0101rada was also very pleased."

        "purport": " The words m\u0101na-vardhano mahat\u0101m (\u201cjust to show honor to superiors\u201d) are very significant. Although Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata was already a liberated person and had no attraction for material things, he engaged himself fully in governmental affairs just to show respect to Lord Brahm\u0101. Arjuna had also acted in the same way. Arjuna had no desire to participate in political affairs or the fighting at Kuruk\u1e63etra, but when ordered to do so by the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he executed those duties very nicely. One who always thinks of the lotus feet of the Lord is certainly above all the contamination of the material world. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cOf all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\u201d (Bg. 6.47) Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata, therefore, was a liberated person and was among the highest of yog\u012bs, yet superficially he became the emperor of the universe in accordance with the order of Lord Brahm\u0101. Showing respect to his superior in this way was another of his extraordinary qualifications. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (6.17.28): A devotee who is actually advanced is not afraid of anything, provided he has the opportunity to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the proper explanation of why Priyavrata engaged in worldly affairs although he was a liberated person. Also, only because of this principle does a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, who has nothing to do with the material world, come down to the second platform of devotional service to preach the glories of the Lord all over the world."

In her he begot ten sons equal to him in beauty, character, magnanimity and other qualities. He also begot a daughter, the youngest of all, named \u016arjasvat\u012b.",
        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata not only carried out the order of Lord Brahm\u0101 by accepting the duties of government, but also married Barhi\u1e63mat\u012b, the daughter of Vi\u015bvakarm\u0101, one of the praj\u0101patis. Since Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata was fully trained in transcendental knowledge, he could have returned home and conducted the business of government as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b. Instead, however, when he returned to household life, he accepted a wife also. The principle is that when one becomes a g\u1e5bhastha he must live perfectly in that order, which means he must live peacefully with a wife and children. When Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s first wife died, His mother requested Him to marry for a second time. He was twenty years old and was going to take sanny\u0101sa at the age of twenty-four, yet by the request of His mother, He married. \u201cAs long as I am in household life,\u201d He told His mother, \u201cI must have a wife, for household life does not mean staying in a house. Real household life means living in a house with a wife.\u201d Three words in this verse are very significant \u2014 u ha v\u0101va. These words are used to express wonder. Priyavrata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had taken a vow of renunciation, but accepting a wife and begetting children have nothing to do with the path of renunciation; these are activities on the path of enjoyment. It was a source of great wonder, therefore, that Priyavrata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who had followed the path of renunciation, had now accepted the path of enjoyment. Sometimes we are criticized because although I am a sanny\u0101s\u012b I have taken part in the marriage ceremonies of my disciples. It must be explained, however, that since we have started a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious society and since a human society must also have ideal marriages, to correctly establish an ideal society we must take part in marrying some of its members, although we have taken to the path of renunciation. This may be astonishing to persons who are not very interested in establishing daiva-var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama, the transcendental system of four social orders and four spiritual orders. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, however, wanted to reestablish daiva-var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama. In daiva-var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama there cannot be acknowledgement of social status according to birthright because in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that the determining considerations are gu\u1e47a and karma, one\u2019s qualities and work. It is this daiva-var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama that should be established all over the world to continue a perfect society for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This may be astonishing to foolish critics, but it is one of the functions of a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious society."

        "purport": " The word \u016brdhva-retasa\u1e25 in this verse is very significant. \u016ardhva-reta\u1e25 refers to one who can control sex life and who instead of wasting semen by discharging it can use this most important substance accumulated in the body to enrich the brain. One who can completely control sex life is able to work wonderfully with his brain, especially in remembering. Thus students who simply hear Vedic instructions once from their teacher could remember them verbatim without needing to read books, which therefore did not exist in former times. Another significant word is arbha-bh\u0101v\u0101t, which means \u201cfrom very childhood.\u201d Another meaning is \u201cfrom being very affectionate to children.\u201d In other words, paramaha\u1e41sa life is dedicated for the benefit of others. Just as a father sacrifices many things out of affection for his son, great saintly persons sacrifice all kinds of bodily comforts for the benefit of human society. In this connection there is a verse concerning the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs: Because of their compassion for the poor fallen souls, the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs gave up their exalted positions as ministers and took vows as mendicants. Thus minimizing their bodily wants as far as possible, they each accepted only a loincloth and a begging bowl. Thus they remained in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to execute the orders of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu by compiling and publishing various Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava literatures."

        "translation": "Thus situated in the renounced order from the beginning of their lives, all three of them completely controlled the activities of their senses and thus became great saints. They concentrated their minds always upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the resting place of the totality of living entities and who is therefore celebrated as V\u0101sudeva. Lord V\u0101sudeva is the only shelter of those who are actually afraid of material existence. By constantly thinking of His lotus feet, these three sons of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata became advanced in pure devotional service. By the prowess of their devotional service, they could directly perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul, and realize that there was qualitatively no difference between themselves and Him.",
        "purport": " The paramaha\u1e41sa stage is the topmost position in renounced life. In sanny\u0101sa, the renounced order, there are four stages \u2014 ku\u1e6d\u012bcaka, bah\u016bdaka, parivr\u0101jak\u0101c\u0101rya and paramaha\u1e41sa. According to the Vedic system, when one accepts the renounced order, he stays outside his village in a cottage, and his necessities, especially his food, are supplied from home. This is called the ku\u1e6d\u012bcaka stage. When a sanny\u0101s\u012b advances further, he no longer accepts anything from home: instead, he collects his necessities, especially his food, from many places. This system is called m\u0101dhukar\u012b, which literally means \u201cthe profession of the bumblebees.\u201d As bumblebees collect honey from many flowers, a little from each, so a sanny\u0101s\u012b should beg from door to door but not accept very much food from any particular house; he should collect a little bit from every house. This is called the bah\u016bdaka stage. When a sanny\u0101s\u012b is still more experienced, he travels all over the world to preach the glories of Lord V\u0101sudeva. He is then known as parivr\u0101jak\u0101c\u0101rya. The sanny\u0101s\u012b reaches the paramaha\u1e41sa stage when he finishes his preaching work and sits down in one place, strictly for the sake of advancing in spiritual life. An actual paramaha\u1e41sa is one who completely controls his senses and engages in the unalloyed service of the Lord. Therefore all three of these sons of Priyavrata, namely Kavi, Mah\u0101v\u012bra and Savana, were situated in the paramaha\u1e41sa stage from the very beginning. Their senses could not disturb them, for their senses were completely engaged in serving the Lord. Therefore the three brothers are described in this verse as upa\u015bama-\u015b\u012bl\u0101\u1e25. Upa\u015bama means \u201ccompletely subdued.\u201d Because they completely subdued their senses, they are understood to have been great sages and saints. After subduing their senses, the three brothers concentrated their minds upon the lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19), v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti. The lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva are everything. Lord V\u0101sudeva is the reservoir of all living entities. When this cosmic manifestation is dissolved, all living entities enter the supreme body of the Lord, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who merges within the body of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Both of these vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattvas are v\u0101sudeva-tattvas, and therefore the great sages Kavi, Mah\u0101v\u012bra and Savana concentrated always upon the lotus feet of Lord V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this way they could understand that the Supersoul within the heart is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they could recognize their identity with Him. The complete description of this realization is that simply by discharging the unalloyed form of devotional service, one can realize his self completely. The parama-bhakti-yoga mentioned in this verse means that a living entity, by dint of unalloyed devotional service, has no other interest than the service of the Lord, as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti). By parama-bhakti-yoga, by elevating oneself to the highest platform of loving service, one can automatically be relieved from the bodily concept of life and see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. As confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: An advanced devotee, who is known as a sat, or saint, can always see within his heart the Supreme Personality of Godhead, face to face. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u015ay\u0101masundara, expands Himself by His plenary portion, and thus a devotee can always see Him within his heart."

Whenever he was determined to fix his arrow upon his bowstring with his two powerful arms, all opponents of the regulative principles of religious life would flee from his presence in fear of the unparalleled prowess he displayed in ruling the universe. He greatly loved his wife Barhi\u1e63mat\u012b, and with the increase of days, their exchange of nuptial love also increased. By her feminine behavior as she dressed herself, walked, got up, smiled, laughed, and glanced about, Queen Barhi\u1e63mat\u012b increased his energy. Thus although he was a great soul, he appeared lost in the feminine conduct of his wife. He behaved with her just like an ordinary man, but actually he was a great soul.",
        "purport": " In this verse, the word dharma-pratipak\u1e63a\u1e25 (\u201copponents of religious principles\u201d) refers not to a particular faith, but to var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, the division of society, socially and spiritually, into four var\u1e47as (br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra) and four \u0101\u015bramas (brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa). To maintain proper social order and help the citizens gradually progress toward the goal of life \u2014 namely spiritual understanding \u2014 the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma must be accepted. From this verse, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata appears to have been so strict in maintaining this institution of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma that anyone neglecting it would immediately flee from his presence as soon as the King warned him by fighting or administering light punishment. Indeed, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata would not have to fight, for simply because of his strong determination, they dared not disobey the rules and regulations of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. It is said that unless human society is regulated by var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, it is no better than a bestial society of cats and dogs. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata, therefore, strictly maintained var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma by his extraordinary, unparalleled prowess. To maintain such a life of strict vigilance, one needs encouragement from his wife. In the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma system, certain classes, such as the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and sanny\u0101s\u012bs, do not need encouragement from the opposite sex. K\u1e63atriyas and g\u1e5bhasthas, however, actually need the encouragement of their wives in order to execute their duties. Indeed, a g\u1e5bhastha or k\u1e63atriya cannot properly execute his responsibilities without the association of his wife. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu personally admitted that a g\u1e5bhastha must live with a wife. K\u1e63atriyas were even allowed to have many wives to encourage them in discharging the duties of government. The association of a good wife is necessary in a life of karma and political affairs. To execute his duties properly, therefore, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata took advantage of his good wife Barhi\u1e63mat\u012b, who was always very expert in pleasing her great husband by properly dressing herself, smiling, and exhibiting her feminine bodily features. Queen Barhi\u1e63mat\u012b always kept Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata very encouraged, and thus he executed his governmental duty very properly. In this verse iva has twice been used to indicate that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata acted exactly like a henpecked husband and thereby seemed to have lost his sense of human responsibility. Actually, however, he was fully conscious of his position as a spirit soul, although he seemingly behaved like an acquiescent karm\u012b husband. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata thus ruled the universe for eleven arbudas of years. One arbuda consists of 100,000,000 years, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata ruled the universe for eleven such arbudas."

        "translation": "While so excellently ruling the universe, King Priyavrata once became dissatisfied with the circumambulation of the most powerful sun-god. Encircling Sumeru Hill on his chariot, the sun-god illuminates all the surrounding planetary systems. However, when the sun is on the northern side of the hill, the south receives less light, and when the sun is in the south, the north receives less. King Priyavrata disliked this situation and therefore decided to make daylight in the part of the universe where there was night. He followed the orbit of the sun-god on a brilliant chariot and thus fulfilled his desire. He could perform such wonderful activities because of the power he had achieved by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " There is a Bengali saying which describes that someone is so powerful that he can make the night day and the day night. That saying is current because of the prowess of Priyavrata. His activities demonstrate how powerful he became by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as Yoge\u015bvara, the master of all mystic powers. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.78) it is said wherever there is the master of all mystic powers (yatra yoge\u015bvara\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25), victory, fortune and all other opulences are present. Devotional service is so powerful. When a devotee achieves what he wants to accomplish, it is not by his own mystic power but by the grace of the master of mystic power, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: by His grace, a devotee can accomplish wonderful things unimaginable even to the most powerful scientist. From the description in this verse, it appears that the sun moves. According to modern astronomers, the sun is fixed in one place, surrounded by the solar system, but here we find that the sun is not stationary: it is rotating in a prescribed orbit. This fact is corroborated by Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.52). Yasy\u0101j\u00f1ay\u0101 bhramati sa\u1e41bh\u1e5bta-k\u0101la-cakra\u1e25: the sun is rotating in its fixed orbit in accordance with the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Jyotir Veda, the science of astronomy in the Vedic literature, the sun moves for six months on the northern side of the Sumeru Hill and for six months on the southern side. We have practical experience on this planet that when there is summer in the north there is winter in the south and vice versa. Modern materialistic scientists sometimes present themselves as knowing all the ingredients of the sun, yet they are unable to offer a second sun like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata\u2019s. Although Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata devised a very powerful chariot as brilliant as the sun, he had no desire to compete with the sun-god, for a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava never wants to supersede another Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. His purpose was to give abundant benefits in material existence. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks that in the months of April and May the rays of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata\u2019s brilliant sun were as pleasing as the rays of the moon, and in October and November, both morning and evening, that sun provided more warmth than the sunshine. In short, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata was extremely powerful, and his actions extended his power in all directions."

For a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything is possible because the Lord is also known as Urukrama.\u201d Urukrama is a name for Lord V\u0101manadeva, who performed the wonderful act of occupying the three worlds with three footsteps. Lord V\u0101manadeva requested three paces of land from Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bali, and when Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bali agreed to grant them, the Lord immediately covered the entire world with two footsteps, and for His third step He placed His foot upon Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s head. \u015ar\u012b Jayadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says: \u201cAll glories to Lord Ke\u015bava, who assumed the form of a dwarf. O Lord of the universe, who take away everything inauspicious for the devotees! O wonderful V\u0101manadeva! You tricked the great demon Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja by Your steps. The water that touched the nails of Your lotus feet when You pierced through the covering of the universe purifies all living entities in the form of the river Ganges.\u201d Since the Supreme Lord is all-powerful, He can do things that seem wonderful for a common man. Similarly, a devotee who has taken shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord can also do wonderful things unimaginable to a common man, by the grace of the dust of those lotus feet. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore teaches us to take shelter of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet: \u201cO son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, I am Your eternal servant, yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death. Please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms of Your lotus feet.\u201d Lord Caitanya teaches us to come in touch with the dust of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, for then there will undoubtedly be all success. Because of the material body, every living entity in material existence is always disturbed by \u1e63ad-gu\u1e47a, six waves \u2014 hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, invalidity and death. Furthermore, another \u1e63ad-gu\u1e47a are the mind and five sense organs. Not to speak of a sanctified devotee, even a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la, an outcaste, who is untouchable, is immediately freed from material bondage if he utters the holy name of the Lord even once. Sometimes caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as argue that unless one changes his body he cannot be accepted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, for since the present body is obtained as a result of past actions, one who has in the past acted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a takes birth in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. Therefore, they contend, without such a brahminical body, one cannot be accepted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Herein it is said, however, that even vid\u016bra-vigata, a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la \u2014 a fifth-class untouchable \u2014 is freed if he utters the holy name even once. Being freed means that he immediately changes his body. San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b confirms this: When a person, even though a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la, is initiated by a pure devotee into chanting the holy name of the Lord, his body changes as he follows the instructions of the spiritual master. Although one cannot see how his body has changed, we must accept, on the grounds of the authoritative statements of the \u015b\u0101stras, that he changes his body. This is to be understood without arguments. This verse clearly says, sa jah\u0101ti bandham: \u201cHe gives up his material bondage.\u201d The body is a symbolic representation of material bondage according to one\u2019s karma. Although sometimes we cannot see the gross body changing, chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord immediately changes the subtle body, and because the subtle body changes, the living entity is immediately freed from material bondage. After all, changes of the gross body are conducted by the subtle body. After the destruction of the gross body, the subtle body takes the living entity from his present gross body to another. In the subtle body, the mind is predominant, and therefore if one\u2019s mind is always absorbed in remembering the activities or the lotus feet of the Lord, he is to be understood to have already changed his present body and become purified. Therefore it is irrefutable that a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la, or any fallen or lowborn person, can become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a simply by the method of bona fide initiation."

Thus his mind now became restless, and he began to speak in a spirit of renunciation.",
        "purport": " In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.17) it is said: \u201cOne who has forsaken his material occupations to engage in the devotional service of the Lord may sometimes fall down while in an immature stage, yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful. On the other hand, a nondevotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything.\u201d If one somehow or other comes to the shelter of a great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because of sentiment or realization, but in course of time falls down because of immature understanding, he is not actually fallen, for his having engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a permanent asset. If one falls down, therefore, his progress might be checked for a certain time, but it will again become manifest at an opportune moment. Although Priyavrata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was serving according to the instructions of N\u0101rada Muni meant for going back home, back to Godhead, he returned to material affairs at the request of his father. In due course of time, however, his consciousness for serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reawakened by the grace of his spiritual master, N\u0101rada. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.41), \u015buc\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 \u015br\u012bmat\u0101\u1e41 gehe yoga-bhra\u1e63\u1e6do\u00a0\u2019bhij\u0101yate. One who falls down from the process of bhakti-yoga is again offered the opulence of the demigods, and after enjoying such material opulence, he is given a chance to take birth in a noble family of a pure br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or in a rich family, to be given the chance to revive his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This actually happened in the life of Priyavrata: he is a most glorious example of this truth. In due course of time, he no longer wanted to enjoy his material opulences and his wife, kingdom and sons; instead, he wanted to renounce them all. Therefore, after having described the material opulences of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, in this verse, describes his tendency for renunciation. The words devar\u1e63i-cara\u1e47\u0101nu\u015bayana indicate that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata, having fully surrendered to the great sage Devar\u1e63i N\u0101rada, was strictly following all the devotional processes and regulative principles under his direction. In regard to strictly following the regulative principles, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says; da\u1e47\u1e0davat-pra\u1e47\u0101m\u0101s t\u0101n anupatita\u1e25. By immediately offering obeisances (da\u1e47\u1e0davat) unto the spiritual master and by strictly following his directions, the student becomes advanced. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata was doing all these things regularly. As long as one is in the material world, he has to be under the influence of the modes of material nature (gu\u1e47a-visarga). It is not that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata was freed from material influence because he possessed all material opulences. In this material world, both the very poor man and the very rich man are under material influences, for both wealth and poverty are creations of the modes of material nature. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.27), prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 karm\u0101\u1e47i sarva\u015ba\u1e25. According to the modes of material nature we acquire, the material nature gives us facility for material enjoyment."

Just see how I have become like a dancing monkey in the hands of my wife. Because of this, I am condemned.",
        "purport": " How condemned is the advancement of material knowledge can be understood from the behavior of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata. He performed such wonderful acts as creating another sun, which shined during the night, and creating a chariot so great that its wheels formed vast oceans. These activities are so great that modern scientists cannot even imagine how such things can be done. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata acted very wonderfully in the material field of activities, but because he was dealing in sense gratification \u2014 ruling his kingdom and dancing to the indications of his beautiful wife \u2014 he personally condemned himself. When we think about this example of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata, we can just consider how degraded is the modern civilization of materialistic advancement. Modern so-called scientists and other materialists are very satisfied because they can construct great bridges, roads and machines, but such activities are nothing comparable to those of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata. If Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata could condemn himself in spite of his wonderful activities, how condemned we are in our so-called advancement of material civilization. We can conclude that such advancement has nothing to do with the problems of the living entity entangled within this material world. Unfortunately, modern man does not understand his entanglement and how condemned he is, nor does he know what kind of body he is going to have in the next life. From a spiritual point of view, a great kingdom, beautiful wife and wonderful material activities are all impediments to spiritual advancement. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata had served the great sage N\u0101rada sincerely. Therefore even though he had accepted material opulences, he could not be deviated from his own task. He again became K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cIn devotional service there is no loss or diminution, and even a small service rendered in devotional life is sufficient to save one from the greatest danger.\u201d (Bg. 2.40) Such renunciation as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata\u2019s is possible only by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally when people are powerful or when they have a beautiful wife, a beautiful home and material popularity, they become more and more entangled. Priyavrata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, having been completely trained by the great sage N\u0101rada, revived his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in spite of all impediments."

        "translation": "By the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata reawakened to his senses. He divided all his earthly possessions among his obedient sons. He gave up everything, including his wife, with whom he had enjoyed so much sense gratification, and his great and opulent kingdom, and he completely renounced all attachment. His heart, having been cleansed, became a place of pastimes for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he was able to return to the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, spiritual life, and resume the position he had attained by the grace of the great saint N\u0101rada.",
        "purport": " As enunciated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu in His \u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka, ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjana\u1e41 bhava-mah\u0101-d\u0101v\u0101gni-nirv\u0101pa\u1e47am: as soon as one\u2019s heart is cleansed, the blazing fire of material existence is immediately extinguished. Our hearts are meant for the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means that one should be fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as He Himself advises (man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru). This should be our only business. One whose heart is not clean cannot think of the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Lord, but if one can once again place the Supreme Personality of Godhead in his heart, he very easily becomes qualified to renounce material attachment. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs try to give up this material world simply by saying, brahma satya\u1e41 jagan mithy\u0101: \u201cThis world is false. There is no use of it. Let us take to Brahman.\u201d Such theoretical knowledge will not help us. If we believe that Brahman is the real truth, we have to place within our hearts the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a did (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25). One has to fix the lotus feet of the Lord within his heart. Then he gets the strength to be freed from material entanglement. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata was able to give up his opulent kingdom, and he also gave up the association of his beautiful wife as if she were a dead body. However beautiful one\u2019s wife and however attractive her bodily features, one is no longer interested in her when her body is dead. We praise a beautiful woman for her body, but that same body, when bereft of a spirit soul, is no longer interesting to any lusty man. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata was so strong, by the grace of the Lord, that even though his beautiful wife was alive, he could give up her association exactly like one who is forced to give up the association of a dead wife. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said: \u201cO almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor do I desire beautiful women, nor do I want any number of followers. I only want Your causeless devotional service birth after birth.\u201d For one who desires to advance in spiritual life, attachment to material opulence and attachment to a beautiful wife are two great impediments. Such attachments are condemned even more than suicide. Therefore anyone desiring to cross beyond material nescience must, by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, be freed from attachment to women and money. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata became completely free from these attachments, he could again peacefully follow the principles instructed by the great sage N\u0101rada."

This is also mentioned in relation to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu, who was born from the dead body of his father by the manipulation of great sages. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu\u2019s father was very sinful, and therefore a black man called Ni\u1e63\u0101da was first born from his dead body. The Nai\u1e63\u0101da race was given a place in the forest because by nature they are thieves and rogues. As animals are given places in various forests and hills, men who are like animals are also destined to live there. One cannot be promoted to civilized life unless one comes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for by nature one is destined to live in a particular situation according to one\u2019s karma and association with the modes of nature. If men want to live in harmony and peace, they must take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for they cannot achieve the highest standard while absorbed in the bodily concept of life. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata divided the surface of the globe into different islands so that each class of men would live peacefully and not clash with the others.
