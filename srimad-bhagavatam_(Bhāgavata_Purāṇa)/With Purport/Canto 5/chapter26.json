Out of ignorance, a man in the first class thinks his body to be his self, and therefore he is certainly like an animal (sa eva go-khara\u1e25). The person in the second class, however, not only thinks his material body to be his self, but also commits all kinds of sinful activities to maintain his body. He cheats everyone to acquire money for his family and his self, and he becomes envious of others without reason. Such a person is thrown into the hell known as Raurava. If one simply considers his body to be his self, as do the animals, he is not very sinful. However, if one needlessly commits sins to maintain his body, he is put into the hell known as Raurava. This is the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura. Although animals are certainly in the bodily concept of life, they do not commit any sins to maintain their bodies, mates or offspring. Therefore animals do not go to hell. However, when a human being acts enviously and cheats others to maintain his body, he is put into a hellish condition."

        "translation": "If a person deviates from the path of the Vedas in the absence of an emergency, the servants of Yamar\u0101ja put him into the hell called Asi-patravana, where they beat him with whips. When he runs hither and thither, fleeing from the extreme pain, on all sides he runs into palm trees with leaves like sharpened swords. Thus injured all over his body and fainting at every step, he cries out, \u201cOh, what shall I do now! How shall I be saved!\u201d This is how one suffers who deviates from the accepted religious principles.",
        "purport": " There is actually only one religious principle: dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam. The only religious principle is to follow the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unfortunately, especially in this Age of Kali, everyone is an atheist. People do not even believe in God, what to speak of following His words. The words nija-veda-patha can also mean \u201cone\u2019s own set of religious principles.\u201d Formerly there was only one veda-patha, or set of religious principles. Now there are many. It doesn\u2019t matter which set of religious principles one follows: the only injunction is that he must follow them strictly. An atheist, or n\u0101stika, is one who does not believe in the Vedas. However, even if one takes up a different system of religion, according to this verse he must follow the religious principles he has accepted. Whether one is a Hindu, or a Mohammedan or a Christian, he should follow his own religious principles. However, if one concocts his own religious path within his mind, or if one follows no religious principles at all, he is punished in the hell known as Asi-patravana. In other words, a human being must follow some religious principles. If he does not follow any religious principles, he is no better than an animal. As Kali-yuga advances, people are becoming godless and taking up so-called secularism. They do not know the punishment awaiting them in Asi-patravana, as described in this verse."

Such insignificant creatures are unaware that their bites are painful to the human being. However, first-class human beings \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas \u2014 are developed in consciousness, and therefore they know how painful it is to be killed. A human being endowed with knowledge certainly commits sin if he kills or torments insignificant creatures, who have no discrimination. The Supreme Lord punishes such a man by putting him into the hell known as Andhak\u016bpa, where he is attacked by all the birds and beasts, reptiles, mosquitoes, lice, worms, flies, and any other creatures he tormented during his life. They attack him from all sides, robbing him of the pleasure of sleep. Unable to rest, he constantly wanders about in the darkness. Thus in Andhak\u016bpa his suffering is just like that of a creature in the lower species.",
        "purport": " From this very instructive verse we learn that lower animals, created by the laws of nature to disturb the human being, are not subjected to punishment. Because the human being has developed consciousness, however, he cannot do anything against the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma without being condemned. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13), c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25: \u201cAccording to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.\u201d Thus all men should be divided into four classes \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras \u2014 and they should act according to their ordained regulations. They cannot deviate from their prescribed rules and regulations. One of these states that they should never trouble any animal, even those that disturb human beings. Although a tiger is not sinful if he attacks another animal and eats its flesh, if a man with developed consciousness does so, he must be punished. In other words, a human being who does not use his developed consciousness but instead acts like an animal surely undergoes punishment in many different hells."

After death he is put into the most abominable hell, known as K\u1e5bmibhojana. In that hell is a lake 100,000 yojanas [800,000 miles] wide and filled with worms.

Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.\u201d All food is given to us by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n: the Lord supplies everyone with the necessities of life. Therefore we should acknowledge His mercy by performing yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice). This is the duty of everyone. Indeed, the sole purpose of life is to perform yaj\u00f1a. According to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Bg. 3.9): \u201cWork done as a sacrifice for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has to be performed; otherwise work binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunt\u012b, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage.\u201d If we do not perform yaj\u00f1a and distribute pras\u0101da to others, our lives are condemned. Only after performing yaj\u00f1a and distributing the pras\u0101da to all dependents \u2014 children, br\u0101hma\u1e47as and old men \u2014 should one eat. However, one who cooks only for himself or his family is condemned, along with everyone he feeds. After death he is put into the hell known as K\u1e5bmibhojana."

If one indulges in illicit sexual relations with another man\u2019s wife, that activity is considered identical with having sex with one\u2019s mother. This act is most sinful. The same principle holds for a woman also; if she enjoys sex with a man other than her husband, the act is tantamount to having sexual relations with her father or son. Illicit sex life is always forbidden, and any man or woman who indulges in it is punished in the manner described in this verse."

However, due to bad association one often forgets that his prestigious position has been given to him by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he misuses it by performing various kinds of so-called yaj\u00f1as like K\u0101l\u012b-p\u016bj\u0101 or Durg\u0101-p\u016bj\u0101, in which poor animals are sacrificed. How such a person is punished is described herein. The word dambha-yaj\u00f1e\u1e63u in this verse is significant. If one violates the Vedic instructions while performing yaj\u00f1a and simply makes a show of sacrifice for the purpose of killing animals, he is punishable after death. In Calcutta there are many slaughterhouses where animal flesh is sold that has supposedly been offered in sacrifice before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b. The \u015b\u0101stras enjoin that one can sacrifice a small goat before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b once a month. Nowhere is it said that one can maintain a slaughterhouse in the name of temple worship and daily kill animals unnecessarily. Those who do so receive the punishments described herein."

Because human beings are becoming more and more sinful, there will be a scarcity of rain, and naturally no food grains will be produced. On the plea of relieving the suffering caused by the ensuing famine, the government will impose heavy taxes, especially on the wealthy mercantile community. In this verse, the members of such a government are described as dasyu, thieves. Their main activity will be to plunder the wealth of the people. Whether a highway robber or a government thief, such a man will be punished in his next life by being thrown into the hell known as S\u0101ramey\u0101dana, where he will suffer greatly from the bites of ferocious dogs."

Who can equal me?\u201d His vision is twisted, and he is always afraid that someone will take his wealth. Indeed, he even suspects his superiors. His face and heart dry up at the thought of losing his wealth, and therefore he always looks like a wretched fiend. He is not in any way able to obtain actual happiness, and he does not know what it is to be free from anxiety. Because of the sinful things he does to earn money, augment his wealth and protect it, he is put into the hell called S\u016bc\u012bmukha, where the officials of Yamar\u0101ja punish him by stitching thread through his entire body like weavers manufacturing cloth.",
        "purport": " When one possesses more wealth than necessary, he certainly becomes very proud. This is the situation of men in modern civilization. According to the Vedic culture, br\u0101hma\u1e47as do not possess anything, whereas k\u1e63atriyas possess riches, but only for performing sacrifices and other noble activities as prescribed in the Vedic injunctions. A vai\u015bya also earns money honestly through agriculture, cow protection and some trade. If a \u015b\u016bdra gets money, however, he will spend it lavishly, without discrimination, or simply accumulate it for no purpose. Because in this age there are no qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas or vai\u015byas, almost everyone is a \u015b\u016bdra (kalau \u015b\u016bdra-sambhava\u1e25). Therefore the \u015b\u016bdra mentality is causing great harm to modern civilization. A \u015b\u016bdra does not know how to use money to render transcendental loving service to the Lord. Money is also called lak\u1e63m\u012b, and Lak\u1e63m\u012b is always engaged in the service of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Wherever there is money, it must be engaged in the service of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Everyone should use his money to spread the great transcendental movement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one does not spend money for this purpose but accumulates more than necessary, he will certainly become proud of the money he illegally possesses. The money actually belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29), bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram: \u201cI am the true enjoyer of sacrifices and penances, and I am the owner of all the planets.\u201d Therefore nothing belongs to anyone but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who possesses more money than he needs should spend it for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Unless one does so, he will become puffed up because of his false possessions, and therefore he will be punished in the next life, as described herein."

        "translation": "In the beginning [the second and third cantos of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam] I have already described how one can progress on the path of liberation. In the Pur\u0101\u1e47as the vast universal existence, which is like an egg divided into fourteen parts, is described. This vast form is considered the external body of the Lord, created by His energy and qualities. It is generally called the vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa. If one reads the description of this external form of the Lord with great faith, or if one hears about it or explains it to others to propagate bh\u0101gavata-dharma, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his faith and devotion in spiritual consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, will gradually increase. Although developing this consciousness is very difficult, by this process one can purify himself and gradually come to an awareness of the Supreme Absolute Truth.",
        "purport": " The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is pushing forward the publication of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, as explained especially for the understanding of the modern civilized man, to awaken him to his original consciousness. Without this consciousness, one melts into complete darkness. Whether one goes to the upper planetary systems or the hellish planetary systems, he simply wastes his time. Therefore one should hear of the universal position of the vir\u0101\u1e6d form of the Lord as described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. That will help one save himself from material conditional life and gradually elevate him to the path of liberation so that he can go back home, back to Godhead."

Its translation is as follows. Learned scholars who have full knowledge of all the Vedic scriptures agree that the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are innumerable. These incarnations are classified into two divisions, called pr\u0101bhava and vaibhava. According to the scriptures, pr\u0101bhava incarnations are also classified in two divisions \u2014 those which are called eternal and those which are not vividly described. In this Fifth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, in Chapters Three through Six, there is a description of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, but there is not an expanded description of His spiritual activities. Therefore He is considered to belong to the second group of pr\u0101bhava incarnations. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, First Canto, Chapter Three, verse 13, it is said:"

Therefore \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva has directly explained that His own body belongs to the spiritual platform. This being so, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva did not actually pass stool and urine. Even though He superficially seemed to pass stool and urine, that was also transcendental and cannot be imitated by any common man. It is also stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that the stool and urine of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva were full of transcendental fragrance. One may imitate \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, but he cannot imitate Him by passing stool that is fragrant."

        "purport": "  \u2014 Completed in the Honolulu temple of the Pa\u00f1ca-tattva, June 5, 1995. There is a supplementary note written by His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Prabhup\u0101da in his Gau\u1e0d\u012bya-bh\u0101\u1e63ya. Its translation is as follows. Learned scholars who have full knowledge of all the Vedic scriptures agree that the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are innumerable. These incarnations are classified into two divisions, called pr\u0101bhava and vaibhava. According to the scriptures, pr\u0101bhava incarnations are also classified in two divisions \u2014 those which are called eternal and those which are not vividly described. In this Fifth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, in Chapters Three through Six, there is a description of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, but there is not an expanded description of His spiritual activities. Therefore He is considered to belong to the second group of pr\u0101bhava incarnations. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, First Canto, Chapter Three, verse 13, it is said: \u201cLord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u appeared in the eighth incarnation as the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi [the son of \u0100gn\u012bdhra] and his wife Merudev\u012b. He showed the path of perfection, the paramaha\u1e41sa stage of life, which is worshiped by all the followers of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma.\u201d \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His body is spiritual (sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha). Therefore one might ask how it might be possible that he passed stool and urine. The Gau\u1e0d\u012bya ved\u0101nta \u0101c\u0101rya Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a has replied to this question in his book known as Siddh\u0101nta-ratna (First Portion, texts 65-68). Imperfect men call attention to \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva\u2019s passing stool and urine as a subject matter for the study of nondevotees, who do not understand the spiritual position of a transcendental body. In this Fifth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.6.11) the illusioned and bewildered state of the materialists of this age is fully described. Elsewhere in Fifth Canto (5.5.19) \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva stated, ida\u1e41 \u015bar\u012bram mama durvibh\u0101vyam: \u201cThis body of Mine is inconceivable for materialists.\u201d This is also confirmed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11): \u201cFools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.\u201d The human form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is extremely difficult to understand, and, in fact, for a common man it is inconceivable. Therefore \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva has directly explained that His own body belongs to the spiritual platform. This being so, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva did not actually pass stool and urine. Even though He superficially seemed to pass stool and urine, that was also transcendental and cannot be imitated by any common man. It is also stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that the stool and urine of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva were full of transcendental fragrance. One may imitate \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, but he cannot imitate Him by passing stool that is fragrant. The activities of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, therefore, do not support the claims of a certain class of men known as arhat, who sometimes advertise that they are followers of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva. How can they be followers of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva while they act against the Vedic principles? \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has related that after hearing about the characteristics of Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, the King of Ko\u1e45ka, Ve\u1e45ka and Ku\u1e6daka initiated a system of religious principles known as arhat. These principles were not in accord with Vedic principles, and therefore they are called p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0da-dharma. The members of the arhat community considered \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva\u2019s activities material. However, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore He is on the transcendental platform, and no one can compare to Him."

According to the scriptures, pr\u0101bhava incarnations are also classified in two divisions \u2014 those which are called eternal and those which are not vividly described. In this Fifth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, in Chapters Three through Six, there is a description of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, but there is not an expanded description of His spiritual activities. Therefore He is considered to belong to the second group of pr\u0101bhava incarnations. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, First Canto, Chapter Three, verse 13, it is said: \u201cLord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u appeared in the eighth incarnation as the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi [the son of \u0100gn\u012bdhra] and his wife Merudev\u012b. He showed the path of perfection, the paramaha\u1e41sa stage of life, which is worshiped by all the followers of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma.\u201d \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His body is spiritual (sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha). Therefore one might ask how it might be possible that he passed stool and urine. The Gau\u1e0d\u012bya ved\u0101nta \u0101c\u0101rya Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a has replied to this question in his book known as Siddh\u0101nta-ratna (First Portion, texts 65-68). Imperfect men call attention to \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva\u2019s passing stool and urine as a subject matter for the study of nondevotees, who do not understand the spiritual position of a transcendental body. In this Fifth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.6.11) the illusioned and bewildered state of the materialists of this age is fully described. Elsewhere in Fifth Canto (5.5.19) \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva stated, ida\u1e41 \u015bar\u012bram mama durvibh\u0101vyam: \u201cThis body of Mine is inconceivable for materialists.\u201d This is also confirmed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11): \u201cFools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.\u201d The human form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is extremely difficult to understand, and, in fact, for a common man it is inconceivable. Therefore \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva has directly explained that His own body belongs to the spiritual platform. This being so, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva did not actually pass stool and urine. Even though He superficially seemed to pass stool and urine, that was also transcendental and cannot be imitated by any common man. It is also stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that the stool and urine of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva were full of transcendental fragrance. One may imitate \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, but he cannot imitate Him by passing stool that is fragrant. The activities of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, therefore, do not support the claims of a certain class of men known as arhat, who sometimes advertise that they are followers of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva. How can they be followers of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva while they act against the Vedic principles? \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has related that after hearing about the characteristics of Lord \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, the King of Ko\u1e45ka, Ve\u1e45ka and Ku\u1e6daka initiated a system of religious principles known as arhat. These principles were not in accord with Vedic principles, and therefore they are called p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0da-dharma. The members of the arhat community considered \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva\u2019s activities material. However, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore He is on the transcendental platform, and no one can compare to Him. \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva personally exhibited the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.6.8), d\u0101v\u0101nalas tad vanam \u0101lelih\u0101na\u1e25 saha tena dad\u0101ha: at the conclusion of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva\u2019s pastimes, an entire forest and the Lord\u2019s body were burned to ashes in a great forest fire. In the same way, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva burned people\u2019s ignorance to ashes. He exhibited the characteristics of a paramaha\u1e41sa in His instructions to His sons. The principles of the arhat community, however, do not correspond to the teachings of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva. \u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a remarks that in the Eighth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam there is another description of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, but that \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva is different from the one described in this canto."
