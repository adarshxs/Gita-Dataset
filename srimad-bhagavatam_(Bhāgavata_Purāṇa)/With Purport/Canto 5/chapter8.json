        "purport": " The laws of nature work in subtle ways unknown to us. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata was a great king very advanced in devotional service. He had almost reached the point of loving service to the Supreme Lord, but even from that platform he could fall down onto the material platform. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we are therefore warned: \u201cO best among men [Arjuna], the person who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation.\u201d (Bg. 2.15) Spiritual salvation and liberation from material bondage must be worked out with great caution, otherwise a little discrepancy will cause one to fall down again into material existence. By studying the activities of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata, we can learn the art of becoming completely freed from all material attachment. As it will be revealed in later verses, Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had to accept the body of a deer due to being overly compassionate for this infant deer. We should be compassionate by raising one from the material platform to the spiritual platform; otherwise at any moment our spiritual advancement may be spoiled, and we may fall down onto the material platform. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata\u2019s compassion for the deer was the beginning of his falldown into the material world."

He was always careful to protect it from the attacks of tigers and other animals. When it itched, he petted it, and in this way he always tried to keep it in a comfortable condition. He sometimes kissed it out of love. Being attached to raising the deer, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata forgot the rules and regulations for the advancement of spiritual life, and he gradually forgot to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After a few days, he forgot everything about his spiritual advancement.",

If we neglect doing this, we will eventually fall down. We must rise early in the morning, bathe, attend ma\u1e45gala-\u0101rati, worship the Deities, chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, study the Vedic literatures and follow all the rules prescribed by the \u0101c\u0101ryas and the spiritual master. If we deviate from this process, we may fall down, even though we may be very highly advanced. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.5): \u201cActs of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up but should be performed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great soul.\u201d Even if one is in the renounced order, he should never give up the regulative principles. He should worship the Deity and give his time and life to the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He should also continue following the rules and regulations of austerity and penance. These things cannot be given up. One should not think oneself very advanced simply because one has accepted the sanny\u0101sa order.

Naturally such an advanced person thinks of the suffering of the people in general. However, if one does not know of the material sufferings of fallen souls and becomes sympathetic because of bodily comforts, as in the case of Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, such sympathy or compassion is the cause of one\u2019s downfall. If one is actually sympathetic to fallen, suffering humanity, he should try to elevate people from material consciousness to spiritual consciousness. As far as the deer was concerned, Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja became very sympathetic, but he forgot that it was impossible for him to elevate a deer to spiritual consciousness, because, after all, a deer is but an animal. It was very dangerous for Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to sacrifice all his regulative principles simply to take care of an animal. The principles enunciated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be followed. Ya\u1e41 hi na vyathayanty ete puru\u1e63a\u1e41 puru\u1e63ar\u1e63abha. As far as the material body is concerned, we cannot do anything for anyone. However, by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we may raise a person to spiritual consciousness if we ourselves follow the rules and regulations. If we give up our own spiritual activities and simply become concerned with the bodily comforts of others, we will fall into a dangerous position."

        "purport": " M\u0101y\u0101 is very strong. In the name of philanthropy, altruism and communism, people are feeling compassion for suffering humanity throughout the world. Philanthropists and altruists do not realize that it is impossible to improve people\u2019s material conditions. Material conditions are already established by the superior administration according to one\u2019s karma. They cannot be changed. The only benefit we can render to suffering beings is to try to raise them to spiritual consciousness. Material comforts cannot be increased or decreased. It is therefore said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.18), tal labhyate du\u1e25khavad anyata\u1e25 sukham: \u201cAs far as material happiness is concerned, that comes without effort, just as tribulations come without effort.\u201d Material happiness and pain can be attained without endeavor. One should not bother for material activities. If one is at all sympathetic or able to do good to others, he should endeavor to raise people to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In this way everyone advances spiritually by the grace of the Lord. For our instruction, Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja acted in such a way. We should be very careful not to be misled by so-called welfare activities conducted in bodily terms. One should not give up his interest in attaining the favor of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u at any cost. Generally people do not know this, or they forget it. Consequently they sacrifice their original interest, the attainment of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s favor, and engage in philanthropic activities for bodily comfort."

Due to the fruitive results of his past deeds, he fell down from mystic yoga, austerity and worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If it were not due to his past fruitive activity, how could he have been attracted to the deer after giving up the association of his own son and family, considering them stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual life? How could he show such uncontrollable affection for a deer? This was definitely due to his past karma. The King was so engrossed in petting and maintaining the deer that he fell down from his spiritual activities. In due course of time, insurmountable death, which is compared to a venomous snake that enters the hole created by a mouse, situated itself before him.",
        "purport": " As will be seen in later verses, Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, at the time of death, would be forced to accept the body of a deer due to his attraction for the deer. In this regard, a question may be raised. How can a devotee be affected by his past misconduct and vicious activities? In Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.54) it is said, karm\u0101\u1e47i nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bh\u0101j\u0101m: \u201cFor those engaged in devotional service, bhakti-bhajana, the results of past deeds are indemnified.\u201d According to this, Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja could not be punished for his past misdeeds. The conclusion must be that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata purposefully became over-addicted to the deer and neglected his spiritual advancement. To immediately rectify his mistake, for a short time he was awarded the body of a deer. This was just to increase his desire for mature devotional service. Although Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was awarded the body of an animal, he did not forget what had previously happened due to his purposeful mistake. He was very anxious to get out of his deer body, and this indicates that his affection for devotional service was intensified, so much so that he was quickly to attain perfection in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a body in the next life. It is with this conviction that we declare in our Back to Godhead magazine that devotees like the gosv\u0101m\u012bs living in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana who purposely commit some sinful activity are born in the bodies of dogs, monkeys and tortoises in that holy land. Thus they take on these lower life forms for a short while, and after they give up those animal bodies they are again promoted to the spiritual world. Such punishment is only for a short period, and it is not due to past karma. It may appear to be due to past karma, but it is offered to rectify the devotee and bring him to pure devotional service."

Actually the mind of the King was absorbed in the body of the deer, and consequently \u2014 like those bereft of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2014 he left the world, the deer, and his material body and acquired the body of a deer. However, there was one advantage. Although he lost his human body and received the body of a deer, he did not forget the incidents of his past life.",
        "purport": " There was a difference between Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s acquiring a deer body and others\u2019 acquiring different bodies according to their mental condition at the time of death. After death, others forget everything that has happened in their past lives, but Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not forget. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.\u201d (Bg. 8.6) After quitting his body, a person gets another body according to his mental condition at the time of death. At death, a person always thinks of that subject matter in which he has been engrossed during his life. According to this law, because Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was always thinking of the deer and forgetting his worship of the Supreme Lord, he acquired the body of a deer. However, due to his having been elevated to the topmost platform of devotional service, he did not forget the incidents of his past life. This special benediction saved him from further deterioration. Due to his past activities in devotional service, he became determined to finish his devotional service even in the body of a deer. It is therefore said in this verse, m\u1e5btam, although he had died, anu, afterwards, na m\u1e5bta janm\u0101nusm\u1e5btir itaravat, he did not forget the incidents of his past life as others forget them. As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.54), karm\u0101\u1e47i nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bh\u0101j\u0101m. It is proved herein that due to the grace of the Supreme Lord, a devotee is never vanquished. Due to his willful neglect of devotional service, a devotee may be punished for a short time, but he again revives his devotional service and returns home, back to Godhead."

I gave up my real sons, wife and home to advance in spiritual life, and I took shelter in a solitary holy place in the forest. I became self-controlled and self-realized, and I engaged constantly in devotional service \u2014 hearing, thinking, chanting, worshiping and remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva. I was successful in my attempt, so much so that my mind was always absorbed in devotional service. However, due to my personal foolishness, my mind again became attached \u2014 this time to a deer. Now I have obtained the body of a deer and have fallen far from my devotional practices.",
        "purport": " Due to his stringent execution of devotional service, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata could remember the activities of his past life and how he was raised to the spiritual platform. Due to his foolishness, he became attached to an insignificant deer and thus fell down and had to accept the body of a deer. This is significant for every devotee. If we misuse our position and think that we are fully engaged in devotional service and can do whatever we like, we have to suffer like Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and be condemned to accept the type of body that impairs our devotional service. Only the human form is able to execute devotional service, but if we voluntarily give this up for sense gratification, we certainly have to be punished. This punishment is not exactly like that endured by an ordinary materialistic person. By the grace of the Supreme Lord, a devotee is punished in such a way that his eagerness to attain the lotus feet of Lord V\u0101sudeva is increased. By his intense desire, he returns home in the next lifetime. Devotional service is very completely described here: tad-anu\u015brava\u1e47a-manana-sa\u1e45k\u012brtan\u0101r\u0101dhan\u0101nusmara\u1e47\u0101bhiyogena. The constant hearing and chanting of the glories of the Lord is recommended in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: satata\u1e41 k\u012brtayanto m\u0101\u1e41 yatanta\u015b ca d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrat\u0101\u1e25. Those who have taken to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be very careful that not a single moment is wasted and that not a single moment is spent without chanting and remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His activities. By His own actions and by the actions of His devotees, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a teaches us how to become cautious in devotional service. Through the medium of Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a teaches us that we must be careful in the discharge of devotional service. If we want to keep our minds completely fixed without deviation, we must engage them in devotional service full time. As far as the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness are concerned, they have sacrificed everything to push on this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Yet they must take a lesson from the life of Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to be very cautious and to see that not a single moment is wasted in frivolous talk, sleep or voracious eating. Eating is not prohibited, but if we eat voraciously we shall certainly sleep more than required. Sense gratification ensues, and we may be degraded to a lower life form. In that way our spiritual progress may be checked at least for the time being. The best course is to take the advice of \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: avyartha-k\u0101latvam. We should see that every moment of our lives is utilized for the rendering of devotional service and nothing else. This is the secure position for one wanting to return home, back to Godhead."

        "translation": "Although Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja received the body of a deer, by constant repentance he became completely detached from all material things. He did not disclose these things to anyone, but he left his mother deer in a place known as K\u0101la\u00f1jara Mountain, where he was born. He again went to the forest of \u015a\u0101lagr\u0101ma and to the \u0101\u015brama of Pulastya and Pulaha.",
        "purport": " It is significant that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata, by the grace of V\u0101sudeva, remembered his past life. He did not waste a moment; he returned to Pulaha-\u0101\u015brama to the village known as \u015a\u0101lagr\u0101ma. Association is very meaningful; therefore ISKCON tries to perfect one who enters the society. The members of this society should always remember that the society is not like a free hotel. All the members should be very careful to execute their spiritual duties so that whoever comes will automatically become a devotee and will be able to return back to Godhead in this very life. Although Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja acquired the body of a deer, he again left his hearth and home, in this case the Mountain K\u0101la\u00f1jara. No one should be captivated by his birthplace and family; one should take shelter of the association of devotees and cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Without disclosing his past to anyone, he remained in that \u0101\u015brama and ate dry leaves only. He was not exactly alone, for he had the association of the Supersoul. In this way he waited for death in the body of a deer. Bathing in that holy place, he finally gave up that body.",
        "purport": " Holy places like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Hardwar, Pray\u0101ga and Jagann\u0101tha Pur\u012b are especially meant for the execution of devotional service. V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana specifically is the most exalted and preferred holy place for Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who are aspiring to return back to Godhead, the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. There are many devotees in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana who regularly bathe in the Yamun\u0101, and this cleanses all the contamination of the material world. By constantly chanting and hearing the holy names and pastimes of the Supreme Lord, one certainly becomes purified and becomes a fit candidate for liberation. However, if one purposefully falls victim to sense gratification, he has to be punished, at least for one lifetime, like Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja."
