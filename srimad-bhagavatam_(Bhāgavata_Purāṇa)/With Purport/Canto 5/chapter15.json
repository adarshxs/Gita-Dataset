These people, who will actually be atheistic and of bad character, will interpret the Vedic principles in an imaginary, infamous way to support their activities. Thus these sinful people will accept Sumati as Lord Buddhadeva and propagate the theory that everyone should follow the principles of Sumati. In this way they will be carried away by mental concoction.",
        "purport": " Those who are \u0100ryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this Age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the Arya Samaj, who members are ignorant of the import of the Vedas in the parampar\u0101 system. They decry all bona fide \u0101c\u0101ryas and pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles, but in fact such non-\u0100ryans do not follow the Vedic principles. Another group of non-\u0100ryans are the Jains, who are referred to in the present verse. Not only do they not follow the Vedic principles, but they have no relationship with Lord Buddha, though they claim to. Imitating the behavior of Sumati, they also claim to be descendants of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva. Those who are Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas carefully avoid their company because they are ignorant of the path of the Vedas. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: \u201cThe real purpose of the Vedas is to understand Me.\u201d This is the injunction of all Vedic literatures. One who does not know the greatness of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be accepted as an \u0100ryan. Lord Buddha, an incarnation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, adopted a particular means to propagate the philosophy of bh\u0101gavata-dharma. He preached almost exclusively among atheists. Atheists do not want any God, and Lord Buddha therefore said that there is no God, but he adopted the means to instruct his followers for their benefit. Therefore he preached in a duplicitous way, saying that there is no God. Nonetheless, he himself was an incarnation of God."

From Udg\u012btha\u2019s wife, Devakuly\u0101, a son named Prast\u0101va was born, and Prast\u0101va begot a son named Vibhu through his wife, Niyuts\u0101. In the womb of his wife, Rat\u012b, Vibhu begot a son named P\u1e5bthu\u1e63e\u1e47a. P\u1e5bthu\u1e63e\u1e47a begot a son named Nakta in the womb of his wife, named \u0100k\u016bti. Nakta\u2019s wife was Druti, and from her womb the great King Gaya was born. Gaya was very famous and pious; he was the best of saintly kings. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and His expansions, who are meant to protect the universe, are always situated in the transcendental mode of goodness, known as vi\u015buddha-sattva. Being the direct expansion of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, King Gaya was also situated in the vi\u015buddha-sattva. Because of this, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Gaya was fully equipped with transcendental knowledge. Therefore he was called Mah\u0101puru\u1e63a.",

A direct incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called a\u1e41\u015ba or sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba, whereas an incarnation from a\u1e41\u015ba is called kal\u0101. Among the kal\u0101s there are the vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-j\u012bvas, or living entities. These are counted among the j\u012bva-tattvas. Those who come directly from Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are called vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva and are sometimes designated as Mah\u0101puru\u1e63a. Another name for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Mah\u0101puru\u1e63a, and a devotee is sometimes called mah\u0101-pauru\u1e63ika."

        "translation": "King Gaya gave full protection and security to the citizens so that their personal property would not be disturbed by undesirable elements. He also saw that there was sufficient food to feed all the citizens. [This is called po\u1e63a\u1e47a.] He would sometimes distribute gifts to the citizens to satisfy them. [This is called pr\u012b\u1e47ana.] He would sometimes call meetings and satisfy the citizens with sweet words. [This is called upal\u0101lana.] He would also give them good instructions on how to become first-class citizens. [This is called anu\u015b\u0101sana.] Such were the characteristics of King Gaya\u2019s royal order. Besides all this, King Gaya was a householder who strictly observed the rules and regulations of household life. He performed sacrifices and was an unalloyed pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was called Mah\u0101puru\u1e63a because as a king he gave the citizens all facilities, and as a householder he executed all his duties so that at the end he became a strict devotee of the Supreme Lord. As a devotee, he was always ready to give respect to other devotees and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord. This is the bhakti-yoga process. Due to all these transcendental activities, King Gaya was always free from the bodily conception. He was full in Brahman realization, and consequently he was always jubilant. He did not experience material lamentation. Although he was perfect in all respects, he was not proud, nor was he anxious to rule the kingdom.",
        "purport": " As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, when He descends to the earth, He has two types of business \u2014 to give protection to the faithful and annihilate the demons (paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m). Since the king is the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is sometimes called nara-deva, that is, the Lord as a human being. According to the Vedic injunctions, he is worshiped as God on the material platform. As a representative of the Supreme Lord, the king had the duty to protect the citizens in a perfect way so that they would not be anxious for food and protection and so that they would be jubilant. The king would supply everything for their benefit, and because of this he would levy taxes. If the king or government otherwise levies taxes on the citizens, he becomes responsible for the sinful activities of the citizens. In Kali-yuga, monarchy is abolished because the kings themselves are subjected to the influence of Kali-yuga. It is understood from the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a that when Bibh\u012b\u1e63a\u1e47a became friends with Lord R\u0101macandra, he promised that if by chance or will he broke the laws of friendship with Lord R\u0101macandra, he would become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or a king in Kali-yuga. In this age, as Bibh\u012b\u1e63a\u1e47a indicated, both br\u0101hma\u1e47as and kings are in a wretched condition. Actually there are no kings or br\u0101hma\u1e47as in this age, and due to their absence the whole world is in a chaotic condition and is always in distress. Compared to present standards, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Gaya was a true representative of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; therefore he was known as Mah\u0101puru\u1e63a."
