In the Laghu-bh\u0101gavat\u0101m\u1e5bta (5.34-36) this is confirmed in the description of the incarnation of Manu. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-dharmottara describes that Lord R\u0101macandra and His brothers \u2014 Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a, Bharata and \u015aatrughna \u2014 are incarnations of V\u0101sudeva, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha respectively. The Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, however, says that Lord R\u0101macandra is an incarnation of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and that the other three brothers are incarnations of \u015ae\u1e63a, Cakra and \u015aa\u1e45kha.

In some millenniums Lord R\u0101macandra and His brothers appear as incarnations of V\u0101sudeva, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, and in other millenniums They appear as incarnations of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, \u015ae\u1e63a, Cakra and \u015aa\u1e45kha. The residence of Lord R\u0101macandra on this planet is Ayodhy\u0101. Ayodhy\u0101 City is still existing in the district of Faizabad, which is situated on the northern side of Uttar Pradesh."

In the Ved\u0101nta He is described as being one without a second. Because of His spiritual potency, He is untouched by the contamination of material nature, and because He is not subjected to material vision, He is known as transcendental. He has no material activities, nor has He a material form or name. Only in pure consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, can one perceive the transcendental form of the Lord. Let us be firmly fixed at the lotus feet of Lord R\u0101macandra, and let us offer our respectful obeisances unto those transcendental lotus feet.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appears in various expansions, as stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.39): \u201cI worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is always situated in various incarnations such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who incarnates personally also.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, has expanded Himself in many Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms, of which Lord R\u0101macandra is one. We know that the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva is carried by the transcendental bird Garu\u1e0da and is equipped with different types of weapons in four hands. Therefore we may doubt whether Lord R\u0101macandra could be in the same category, since He was carried by Hanum\u0101n, not by Garu\u1e0da, and had neither four hands nor the \u015ba\u1e45kha, cakra, gad\u0101 and padma. Consequently this verse clarifies that R\u0101macandra is as good as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u kal\u0101). Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, R\u0101macandra is not different from Him. R\u0101macandra is unaffected by the modes of material nature, and therefore He is pra\u015b\u0101nta, never disturbed by those modes. Unless one is saturated with love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot appreciate the transcendental value of Lord R\u0101macandra; one cannot see Him with material eyes. Because demons like R\u0101va\u1e47a have no spiritual vision, they consider Lord R\u0101macandra an ordinary k\u1e63atriya king. R\u0101va\u1e47a therefore attempted to kidnap Lord R\u0101macandra\u2019s eternal consort, S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b. Actually, however, R\u0101va\u1e47a could not carry off S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b in her original form. As soon as she was touched by R\u0101va\u1e47a\u2019s hands, she gave him a material form, but she maintained her original form beyond his vision. Therefore in this verse the words pratyak pra\u015b\u0101ntam indicate that Lord R\u0101macandra and His potency, the goddess S\u012bt\u0101, keep themselves aloof from the influence of the material energy. In the Upani\u1e63ads it is said: yam evai\u1e63a v\u1e5b\u1e47ute tena labhya\u1e25 (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad\u00a01.2.23). The Supreme Lord, Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Personality of Godhead, can be seen or perceived only by persons who are saturated with devotional service. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38): \u201cI worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of \u015ay\u0101masundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.\u201d Similarly, in the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad it is stated, et\u0101s tisro devat\u0101 anena j\u012bvena. In this verse of the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad the word anena is used to distinguish the \u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101 as two separate identities. The words tisro devat\u0101 indicate that the body of the living entity is made of three material elements \u2014 fire, earth and water. Although the Param\u0101tm\u0101 enters the heart of the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101, who is influenced and designated by a material body, the Param\u0101tm\u0101 has nothing to do with the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101\u2019s body. Because the Param\u0101tm\u0101 has no material connections, He is described here as an\u0101ma-r\u016bpa\u1e41 niraham. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 has no material identity, whereas the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 does. The j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 may introduce himself as an Indian, American, German and so on, but the Param\u0101tm\u0101 has no such material designations, and therefore He has no material name. The j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 is different from his name, but the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is not; His name and He Himself are one and the same. This is the meaning of niraham, which means \u201cwithout material designations.\u201d This word cannot possibly be twisted to mean that the Param\u0101tm\u0101 has no aha\u1e45k\u0101ra, no \u201cI-ness\u201d or identity. He has His transcendental identity as the Supreme. This is the explanation given by \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. According to another interpretation, given by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, niraham means nirni\u015bcayena aham. Niraham does not mean that the Supreme Lord has no identity. Rather, the stress given by the word aham proves strongly that He does have His personal identity because nir not only means \u201cnegative\u201d but also means \u201cstrong ascertainment.\u201d"

        "translation": "It was ordained that R\u0101va\u1e47a, chief of the R\u0101k\u1e63asas, could not be killed by anyone but a man, and for this reason Lord R\u0101macandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared in the form of a human being. Lord R\u0101macandra\u2019s mission, however, was not only to kill R\u0101va\u1e47a but also to teach mortal beings that material happiness centered around sex life or centered around one\u2019s wife is the cause of many miseries. He is the self-sufficient Supreme Personality of Godhead, and nothing is lamentable for Him. Therefore why else could He be subjected to tribulations by the kidnapping of mother S\u012bt\u0101?",
        "purport": " When the Lord appears in this universe in the form of a human being, He has two purposes, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 \u2014 paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m: to destroy the demons and protect the devotees. To protect the devotees, the Lord not only satisfies them by His personal presence but also teaches them so that they will not fall down from devotional service. By His personal example, Lord R\u0101macandra taught the devotees that it is better not to enter married life, which is certainly followed by many tribulations. As confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (7.9.45): K\u1e5bpa\u1e47as, those who are not advanced in spiritual knowledge and who are therefore just the opposite of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, generally take to family life, which is a concession for sex. Thus they enjoy sex again and again, although that sex is followed by many tribulations. This is a warning to devotees. To teach this lesson to devotees and to human society in general, Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101macandra, although the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, underwent a series of tribulations because He accepted a wife, mother S\u012bt\u0101. Lord R\u0101macandra underwent these austerities, of course, only to instruct us; actually He never has any reason to lament for anything. Another aspect of the Lord\u2019s instructions is that one who accepts a wife must be a faithful husband and give her full protection. Human society is divided into two classes of men \u2014 those who strictly follow the religious principles and those who are devotees. By His personal example, Lord R\u0101macandra wanted to instruct both of them how to fully adopt the discipline of the religious system and how to be a beloved and dutiful husband. Otherwise He had no reason to undergo apparent tribulations. One who strictly follows religious principles must not neglect to provide all facilities for the complete protection of his wife. There may be some suffering because of this, but one must nevertheless endure it. That is the duty of a faithful husband. By His personal example, Lord R\u0101macandra demonstrated this duty. Lord R\u0101macandra could have produced hundreds and thousands of S\u012bt\u0101s from His pleasure energy, but just to show the duty of a faithful husband, He not only rescued S\u012bt\u0101 from the hands of R\u0101va\u1e47a but also killed R\u0101va\u1e47a and all the members of his family. Another aspect of the teachings of Lord R\u0101macandra is that although Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His devotees may apparently suffer from material tribulations, they have nothing to do with such tribulations. They are mukta-puru\u1e63as, liberated persons, under all circumstances. It is therefore said in the Caitanya-bh\u0101gavata: A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always firmly situated in transcendental bliss because of engagement in devotional service. Although he may appear to suffer material pains, his position is called transcendental bliss in separation (viraha). The emotions a lover and beloved feel when separated from one another are actually very blissful, although apparently painful. Therefore the separation of Lord R\u0101macandra from S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b, as well as the consequent tribulation they suffered, is but another display of transcendental bliss. That is the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura."

He is the most beloved Supersoul of all self-realized souls, and He is their very intimate friend. He is full of all opulences. Therefore He could not possibly have suffered because of separation from His wife, nor could He have given up His wife and Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a, His younger brother. To give up either would have been absolutely impossible.",
        "purport": " In defining the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we say that He is full in all six opulences \u2014 wealth, fame, strength, influence, beauty and renunciation. He is called renounced because He is not attached to anything in this material world; He is specifically attached to the spiritual world and the living entities there. The affairs of the material world take place under the superintendence of Durg\u0101dev\u012b (s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di-sthiti-pralaya-s\u0101dhana-\u015baktir ek\u0101/ ch\u0101yeva yasya bhuvan\u0101ni bibharti durg\u0101). Everything is going on under the strict rules and regulations of the material energy, represented by Durg\u0101. Therefore the Lord is completely detached and need not give attention to the material world. S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b belongs to the spiritual world. Similarly, Lord Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a, R\u0101macandra\u2019s younger brother, is a manifestation of Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, and Lord R\u0101macandra Himself is V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since the Lord is always spiritually qualified, He is attached to servants who always render transcendental loving service unto Him. He is attached to the truth in life, not to brahminical qualities. Indeed, He is never attached to any material qualities. Although He is the Supersoul of all living entities, He is specifically manifest to those who are self-realized, and He is especially dear to the hearts of His transcendental devotees. Because Lord R\u0101macandra descended to teach human society how dutiful a king should be, He apparently gave up the company of mother S\u012bt\u0101 and Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a. Factually, however, He could not have given them up. One should therefore learn about the activities of Lord R\u0101macandra from a self-realized soul. Then one can understand the transcendental activities of the Lord."

One who possesses all these material qualities is expected to become a devotee, and when he actually does, the qualities are properly utilized. Those who are puffed up by a high birth, wealth, education and personal beauty (janmai\u015bvarya-\u015bruta-\u015br\u012b) unfortunately do not care for developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, nor does the Supreme Personality of Godhead care about all these material qualifications. The Supreme Lord is achieved by devotion (bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti). One\u2019s devotion and sincere desire to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead are the only qualifications. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has also said that the price for achieving God\u2019s favor is simply one\u2019s sincere eagerness to have it (laulyam eka\u1e41 m\u016blyam).

One cannot attain Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by any amount of wealth, followers, or learning. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is controlled only by pure devotion.\u201d Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu had a very sincere devotee whose name was Khol\u0101vec\u0101 \u015ar\u012bdhara and whose only business was to sell pots made of the skin of banana trees. Whatever income he had, he used fifty percent for the worship of mother Ganges, and with the other fifty percent he provided for his necessities. On the whole, he was so very poor that he lived in a cottage that had a broken roof with many holes in it. He could not afford brass utensils, and therefore he drank water from an iron pot. Nevertheless, he was a great devotee of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. He is a typical example of how a poor man with no material possessions can become a most exalted devotee of the Lord. The conclusion is that one cannot attain shelter at the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Gos\u0101\u00f1i through material opulence; that shelter is attainable only by pure devotional service. \u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\u201d"

There is no need of great austerities or penances to worship the Lord, for He accepts even a small service offered by His devotee. Thus He is satisfied, and as soon as He is satisfied, the devotee is successful. Indeed, Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101macandra brought all the devotees of Ayodhy\u0101 back home, back to Godhead [Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha].",

This is the special advantage of worshiping Lord R\u0101macandra, and there is the same advantage in worshiping Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord R\u0101macandra, in the manner of k\u1e63atriyas, sometimes showed Their mercy by killing asuras, but Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu awarded love of God without difficulty even to the asuras. All the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 but especially Lord R\u0101macandra, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and, later, Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu \u2014 delivered many of the living entities present before Them, indeed almost all of them. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is therefore represented in the six-armed form of \u1e63a\u1e0d-bh\u016bja-m\u016brti, which is a combination of Lord R\u0101macandra, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. The best purpose of human life can be fulfilled by worshiping the \u1e63a\u1e0d-bh\u016bja-m\u016brti, the form of the Lord with six arms \u2014 two arms of R\u0101macandra, two arms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and two arms of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu."

        "purport": " People in India may visit the temple of Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at Badarik\u0101\u015brama just to learn how the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a engages in austerities to teach the people of the world how to achieve self-realization. It is impossible to realize oneself simply by absorbing oneself in speculation and material activities. One must be very serious about self-realization and the practice of austerity. Unfortunately, the people of this Age of Kali do not even know the meaning of austerity. Under these circumstances, the Lord has appeared as \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu to bestow upon the fallen souls the easiest method of self-realization, technically called ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam, cleansing of the dirt from the core of one\u2019s heart. This method is extremely simple.

Thus N\u0101rada Muni, along with the other inhabitants of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a, always engages in the service of Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and he chants as follows.",

People should take advantage of the opportunity afforded by Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a, and this is especially so for those who are following the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. If we do not take to the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma by accepting the four social orders (br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra) and the four orders of spiritual life (brahmac\u0101r\u012b, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa), there can be no question of success in life. Unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, everything is now being lost. The inhabitants of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a are gradually becoming degraded mlecchas and yavanas. How then will they teach others? Therefore, this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has been started not only for the inhabitants of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a but for all the people of the world, as announced by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. There is still time, and if the inhabitants of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a take this movement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness seriously, the entire world will be saved from gliding down to a hellish condition. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement follows the process of pa\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi and that of bh\u0101gavata-vidhi simultaneously, so that people can take advantage of the movement and make their lives successful."

Now in this verse He is more fully described. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the creator of the entire cosmic manifestation, yet He is unattached to it. If we were to construct a very tall skyscraper, we would be very attached to it, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so renounced that although He has created everything, He is not attached to anything (na badhyate). Furthermore, although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has His transcendental form, sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, He is not disturbed by the bodily necessities of life, which are called daihika; for example, He is never hungry, thirsty or fatigued (na hanyate deha-gato\u00a0\u2019pi daihikai\u1e25). Then again, since everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s property, He sees everything and is present everywhere, but because His body is transcendental, He is above vision, the objects of vision and the process of vision. When we see someone beautiful, we are attracted. The sight of a beautiful woman immediately attracts a man, and the sight of a man naturally attracts a woman. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, is transcendental to all these faults. Although He is the seer of everything, He is not afflicted with faulty vision (na d\u1e5bg yasya gu\u1e47air vid\u016b\u1e63yate). Therefore, although He is the witness and seer, He is aloof from all affection for the activities He sees. He is always unattached and separate; He is only a witness."

We are all infected by Your illusory energy; therefore we are very attached to the body, which is full of stool and urine, and to anything related with the body. Except for devotional service, there is no way to give up this attachment. Therefore kindly bestow upon us this benediction.",

The perfect yoga system consists of always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, always engaging in devotional service, always worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and always offering obeisances unto Him. Unless we practice this yoga system, our illusory attachment for this bad body, which is full of stool and urine, is impossible to give up. The perfection of yoga consists of giving up attachment for this body and bodily relationships and transferring that attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We are very attached to material enjoyment, but when we transfer that same attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we traverse the path of liberation. One has to practice this yoga system and none other."

At the present moment, certain demoniac sections of the population of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a are disregarding the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. Because there is no institution to teach people how to become br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras or brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, g\u1e5bhasthas, v\u0101naprasthas and sanny\u0101s\u012bs, these demons want a classless society. This is resulting in chaotic conditions. In the name of secular government, unqualified people are taking the supreme governmental posts. No one is being trained to act according to the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, and thus people are becoming increasingly degraded and are heading in the direction of animal life. The real aim of life is liberation, but unfortunately the opportunity for liberation is being denied to people in general, and therefore their human lives are being spoiled. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, however, is being propagated all over the world to reestablish the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma system and thus save human society from gliding down to hellish life."

Then one is able to cut the knot of bondage to ignorance, which bound him because of varied fruitive activities. As a result of associating with devotees, one gradually renders service to Lord V\u0101sudeva, who is transcendental, free from attachment to the material world, beyond the mind and words, and independent of everything else. That bhakti-yoga, devotional service to Lord V\u0101sudeva, is the real path of liberation.",
        "purport": " Brahman realization is the beginning of liberation, and Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization is still further advancement toward the realm of liberation, but one achieves real liberation when he understands his position as an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101 r\u016bpa\u1e41 svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25). In the material world, in the bodily concept of life, everyone is working in the wrong direction. When one becomes brahma-bh\u016bta, spiritually realized, one understands that he is not the body and that working in the bodily concept of life is useless and misdirected. Then his devotional service begins. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): \u201cOne who is thus transcendentally situated realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\u201d Devotional service is actual liberation. When one is attracted by the beauty of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and his mind is always engaged at the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, he is no longer interested in subjects that do not help him in self-realization. In other words, he loses all attraction for material activities. In the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.7) it is said: e\u1e63a hy ev\u0101nandayati; yad\u0101 hy evai\u1e63a etasmin na d\u1e5b\u015bye\u00a0\u2019n\u0101tmye anirukte\u00a0\u2019nilayane\u00a0\u2019bhaya\u1e41 prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u1e41 vindate\u00a0\u2019tha so\u00a0\u2019bhaya\u1e41 gato bhavati. A living entity becomes established in spiritual, blissful life when he fully understands that his happiness depends on spiritual self-realization, which is the basic principle of \u0101nanda (bliss), and when he is eternally situated in the service of the Lord, who has no other lord above Him."

However, one who becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious can go back to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (y\u0101nti-mad-y\u0101jino\u00a0\u2019pi m\u0101m). Therefore the demigods even regret having been elevated to the higher planetary systems. The denizens of the heavenly planets regret that they could not take full advantage of being born in the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a. Instead, they became captivated by a higher standard of sense gratification, and therefore they forgot the lotus feet of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at the time of death. The conclusion is that one who has taken birth in the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a must follow the instructions given personally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante tad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama. One should try to return home, back to Godhead, to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets \u2014 or to the topmost Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana \u2014 to live eternally in full, blissful knowledge in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Although life in Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a, in a lower planetary system, is very short, one who lives there can elevate himself to full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and achieve the highest perfection, even in this short life, by fully surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Thus one attains Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, where there is neither anxiety nor repeated birth in a material body.",
        "purport": " This is further confirmation of the statement given by Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: One who has taken birth in the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a has a full opportunity to study the direct instructions given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and thus finally decide what to do in his human form of life. One should certainly give up all other propositions and surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will then immediately take charge and relieve one of the results of past sinful life (aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25).

One should go directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engage in His service. This is the best opportunity offered to the inhabitants of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a. One who is fit to return home, back to Godhead, is no longer liable to the results of karma, good or bad."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu appeared in the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a, specifically in Bengal, in the district of Nadia, where Navadv\u012bpa is situated. It is therefore to be concluded, as stated by \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura, that within this universe, this earth is the best planet, and on this planet the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a is the best; in the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a, Bengal is still better, in Bengal the district of Nadia is still better, and in Nadia the best place is Navadv\u012bpa because \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu appeared there to inaugurate the performance of the sacrifice of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. The \u015b\u0101stras recommend: Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is always accompanied by His very confidential associates such as \u015ar\u012b Nity\u0101nanda, \u015ar\u012b Gad\u0101dhara and \u015ar\u012b Advaita and by many devotees like \u015ar\u012bv\u0101sa. They are always engaged in chanting the name of the Lord and are always describing Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore this is the best among all the places in the universe. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has established its center in M\u0101y\u0101pur, the birthsite of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, to give men the great opportunity to go there and perform a constant festival of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, as recommended herein (yaj\u00f1e\u015ba-makh\u0101 mahotsav\u0101\u1e25) and to distribute pras\u0101da to millions of hungry people hankering for spiritual emancipation. This is the mission of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Caitanya-bh\u0101gavata confirms this as follows: \u201cOne should not desire to be elevated even to a place in the heavenly planetary systems if it has no propaganda to expand the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no trace of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, pure devotees of the Lord, and no festivals for spreading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It would be better to live perpetually cramped within the airtight bag of a mother\u2019s womb, where one can at least remember the lotus feet of the Lord, than to live in a place where there is no opportunity to remember His lotus feet. I pray not to be allowed to take birth in such a condemned place.\u201d Similarly, in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that since \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is the inaugurator of the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement, anyone who performs sa\u1e45k\u012brtana to please the Lord is very, very glorious. Such a person has perfect intelligence, whereas others are in the ignorance of material existence. Of all the sacrifices mentioned in the Vedic literatures, the performance of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a is the best. Even the performance of one hundred a\u015bvamedha sacrifices cannot compare to the sacrifice of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana. According to the author of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, if one compares sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a to other yaj\u00f1as, he is a p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b, an infidel, and is liable to be punished by Yamar\u0101ja. There are many M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs who think that the performance of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a is a pious activity similar to the performance of the a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1a and other such pious functions, but this is a n\u0101ma-apar\u0101dha. Chanting of the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and chanting of other names are never equal, despite what M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs think."

Other paths, such as the path of j\u00f1\u0101na and the path of karma, are not very profitable. Pious activities can elevate one to the higher planetary systems, and by speculative knowledge one can merge into the Brahman existence, but that is not real profit, for one has to come down again even from the liberated condition of being merged in Brahman, and certainly one must come down from the heavenly kingdom.

This is the subject matter of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement.

Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has advised that one who has taken birth as a human being in Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a must first realize himself as a part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and after taking to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he must distribute this knowledge all over the world."

        "translation": "In India [Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a], there are many worshipers of the demigods, the various officials appointed by the Supreme Lord, such as Indra, Candra and S\u016brya, all of whom are worshiped differently. The worshipers offer the demigods their oblations, considering the demigods part and parcel of the whole, the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts these offerings and gradually raises the worshipers to the real standard of devotional service by fulfilling their desires and aspirations. Because the Lord is complete, He offers the worshipers the benedictions they desire even if they worship only part of His transcendental body.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.13) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.\u201d Mah\u0101tm\u0101s, advanced devotees, worship only the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Others, however, who are also sometimes called mah\u0101tm\u0101s, worship the Lord as ekatvena p\u1e5bthaktvena. In other words, they accept the demigods as different parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and worship them for various benedictions. Although the devotees of the demigods thus achieve the desired results offered by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they have been described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101nah, not very intelligent. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not desire to be worshiped indirectly through the different parts of His body; K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants direct devotional worship. Therefore a devotee who directly worships Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through staunch devotional service, as recommended in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, (t\u012bvre\u1e47a bhakti-yogena yajeta puru\u1e63a\u1e41 param), is very quickly elevated to the transcendental position. Nevertheless, devotees who worship the demigods, the different parts of the Lord, receive the benedictions they desire because the Lord is the original master of all benedictions. If anyone wants a particular benediction, for the Lord to award it is not at all difficult."

However, the Lord willingly gives the devotee shelter at His own lotus feet, even though such a person does not aspire for it, and that shelter satisfies all his desires. That is the Supreme Personality\u2019s special mercy.",
        "purport": " The devotees mentioned in the previous verse approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead with material motives, but this verse explains how such devotees are saved from those desires. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.3.10) advises: \u201cWhether one is freed from all material desires, is full of material desires, or desires to become one with the Supreme, he should engage in devotional service.\u201d In this way, not only will the devotee\u2019s desires be fulfilled, but the day will come when he will have no other desire than to serve the lotus feet of the Lord. One who engages in the service of the Lord with some motive is called a sak\u0101ma-bhakta, and one who serves the Lord without any motives is called an ak\u0101ma-bhakta. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so merciful that He turns a sak\u0101ma-bhakta into an ak\u0101ma-bhakta. A pure devotee, an ak\u0101ma-bhakta, who has no material motives, is satisfied simply to serve the lotus feet of the Lord. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.22). Ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101 c\u0101para\u1e41 l\u0101bha\u1e41 manyate n\u0101dhika\u1e41 tata\u1e25: if one engages in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, he does not want anything more. This is the highest stage of devotional service. The Lord is so kind even to a sak\u0101ma-bhakta, a motivated devotee, that He satisfies his desires in such a way that one day he becomes an ak\u0101ma-bhakta. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, for example, became a bhakta with the motive of getting a better kingdom than that of his father, but finally he became an ak\u0101ma-bhakta and said to the Lord, sv\u0101min k\u1e5bt\u0101rtho \u2019smi vara\u1e41 na y\u0101ce: \u201cMy dear Lord, I am very satisfied simply to serve Your lotus feet. I do not want any material benefits.\u201d Sometimes it is found that a small child eats dirty things, but his parents take away the dirty things and offer him a sande\u015ba or some other sweetmeat. Devotees who aspire for material benedictions are compared to such children. The Lord is so kind that He takes away their material desires and gives them the highest benediction. Therefore, even for material motives, one should not worship anyone other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead; one must fully engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that all his desires will be fulfilled and at the end he can go back home, back to Godhead. This is explained in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.37-39, 41) as follows. Anyak\u0101m\u012b \u2014 a devotee may desire something other than service to the lotus feet of the Lord; yadi kare k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era bhajana \u2014 but if he engages in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service; n\u0101 m\u0101giteha k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a t\u0101re dena sva-cara\u1e47a \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives him shelter at His lotus feet, even though he does not aspire for it.

        "translation": "We are now living in the heavenly planets, undoubtedly as a result of our having performed ritualistic ceremonies, pious activities and yaj\u00f1as and having studied the Vedas. However, our lives here will one day be finished. We pray that at that time, if any merit remains from our pious activities, we may again take birth in Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a as human beings able to remember the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord is so kind that He personally comes to the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a and expands the good fortune of its people.",
        "purport": " It is certainly as a result of pious activities that one takes birth in the heavenly planets, but from those planets one must nevertheless come down again to earth, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti). Even the demigods must return to earth to work like ordinary men when the results of their pious activities expire. Nevertheless, the demigods desire to come to the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a if even a small portion of the merits of their pious activities remains. In other words, to take birth in Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a, one must perform more pious activities than the demigods. In Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a one is naturally K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, and if one further cultivates his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he certainly expands his good fortune by becoming perfect in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and very easily going back home, back to Godhead. In many other places in the Vedic literature it is found that even the demigods want to come to this land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a. A foolish person may desire to be promoted to the heavenly planets as a result of his pious activities, but even the demigods from the heavenly planets want to come to Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a and achieve bodies that may be very easily used to cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu repeatedly says: A human being born in the land of Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a has the special prerogative to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore those already born in Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a should take lessons from the \u015b\u0101stras and guru and should fully take advantage of the mercy of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu in order to be fully equipped with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. By taking full advantage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one goes back home, back to Godhead (y\u0101nti mad-y\u0101jino\u00a0\u2019pi m\u0101m). The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore spreading this facility to human society by opening many, many centers all over the world so that people may associate with the pure devotees of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and ultimately go back home, back to Godhead."

This indicates that even the demigods are unfit to reside in Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a. Therefore if persons already born in Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a live like cats and dogs, not taking full advantage of their birth in this land, they are certainly unfortunate."
