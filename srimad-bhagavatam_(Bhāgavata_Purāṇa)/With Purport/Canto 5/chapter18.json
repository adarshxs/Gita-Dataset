This purification is the aim of human life. This life is not meant for blind indulgence in sense gratification.

Yasm\u0101d brahma-saukhya\u1e41 tv anantam. We are all seeking happiness, but because of our ignorance and foolishness, we cannot know what unobstructed happiness really is. Unobstructed happiness is called brahma-saukhya, spiritual happiness. Although we may get some so-called happiness in this material world, that happiness is temporary. The foolish materialists cannot understand this. Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja points out, m\u0101y\u0101-sukh\u0101ya bharam udvahato vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101n: merely for temporary materialistic happiness, these rascals are making huge arrangements, and thus they are baffled life after life."

        "purport": " Material happiness means to have good facilities for eating, sleeping, sexual intercourse and defense. Within this world, the materialistic person lives only for these four principles of sense gratification, not caring for the impending danger of death. After his father\u2019s death, a son tries to inherit his money and use it for sense gratification. Similarly, one whose son dies tries to enjoy the possessions of his son. Sometimes the father of a dead son even enjoys his son\u2019s widow. Materialistic persons behave in this way. Thus \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says, \u201cHow wonderful are these pastimes of material happiness transacted by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead!\u201d In other words, materialistic persons want to commit all kinds of sinful activities, but without the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no one can do anything. Why does the Supreme Personality of Godhead permit sinful activities? The Supreme Lord does not want any living being to act sinfully, and He begs him through his good conscience to refrain from sin. But when someone insists upon acting sinfully, the Supreme Lord gives him the sanction to act at his own risk (matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca). No one can do anything without the sanction of the Lord, but He is so kind that when the conditioned soul persists in doing something, the Lord permits the individual soul to act at his own risk. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, sons always outlive their fathers in other planetary systems and other lands in this universe, especially on Svargaloka. However, on this planet earth a son often dies before his father, and the materialistic father is pleased to enjoy the possessions of his son. Neither the father nor the son can see the reality \u2014 that both of them are awaiting death. When death comes, however, all their plans for material enjoyment are finished."

        "translation": "O unborn one, learned Vedic scholars who are advanced in spiritual knowledge certainly know that this material world is perishable, as do other logicians and philosophers. In trance they realize the factual position of this world, and they preach the truth as well. Yet even they are sometimes bewildered by Your illusory energy. This is Your own wonderful pastime. Therefore, I can understand that Your illusory energy is very wonderful, and I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",
        "purport": " Not only does the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead act on the conditioned soul within this material world, but sometimes it also acts on the most advanced learned scholars, who factually know the constitutional position of this material world through realization. As soon as someone thinks, \u201cI am this material body (aha\u1e41 mameti) and everything in relationship with this material body is mine,\u201d he is in illusion (moha). This illusion caused by the material energy acts especially on the conditioned souls, but it sometimes also acts on liberated souls as well. A liberated soul is a person who has sufficient knowledge of this material world and is therefore unattached to the bodily conception of life. But because of association with the modes of material nature for a very long time, even liberated souls sometimes become captivated by the illusory energy due to inattentiveness in the transcendental position. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14), m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te: \u201cOnly those who surrender unto Me can overcome the influence of the material energy.\u201d Therefore no one should think of himself as a liberated person immune to the influence of m\u0101y\u0101. Everyone should very cautiously execute devotional service by rigidly following regulative principles. Thus he will remain fixed at the lotus feet of the Lord. Otherwise, a little inattention will create havoc. We have already seen an example of this in the case of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata was undoubtedly a great devotee, but because he turned his attention slightly toward a small deer, he had to suffer two more births, one as a deer and another as the br\u0101hma\u1e47a Ja\u1e0da Bharata. Afterward he was liberated and went back home, back to Godhead. The Lord is always prepared to excuse His devotee, but if a devotee takes advantage of the Lord\u2019s leniency and purposefully commits mistakes again and again, the Lord will certainly punish him by letting him fall down into the clutches of the illusory energy. In other words, theoretical knowledge acquired by studying the Vedas is insufficient to protect one from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. One must strongly adhere to the lotus feet of the Lord in devotional service. Then one\u2019s position is secure."

In the Seventh Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, I shall describe to you how Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja caused the Lord to assume the form of N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the topmost devotee of the Lord, is a reservoir of all the good qualities of great personalities. His character and activities have delivered all the fallen members of his demoniac family. Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva is very dear to this exalted personality. Thus Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, along with his servants and all the denizens of Hari-var\u1e63a, worships Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva by chanting the following mantra.",
        "purport": " Jayadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s ten prayers worshiping the incarnations of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Ke\u015bava) contain His name in every stanza. For example, ke\u015bava dh\u1e5bta-nara-hari-r\u016bpa jaya jagad-\u012b\u015ba hare, ke\u015bava dh\u1e5bta-m\u012bna-\u015bar\u012bra jaya jagad-\u012b\u015ba hare, and ke\u015bava dh\u1e5bta-v\u0101mana-r\u016bpa jaya jagad-\u012b\u015ba hare. The word jagad-\u012b\u015ba refers to the proprietor of all the universes. His original form is the two-handed form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, standing with a flute in His hands and engaged in tending the cows. As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows, yielding all desires, in abodes built with spiritual gems and surrounded by millions of purpose trees. He is always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune.\u201d From this verse we learn that Govinda, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the \u0101di-puru\u1e63a (the original person). The Lord has innumerable incarnations, exactly like the innumerable waves of a flowing river, but the original form is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Ke\u015bava. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b refers to N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva because of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was put into great distress by his powerful father, the demon Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. Apparently helpless before him, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja called on the Lord, who immediately assumed the gigantic form of N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, half-lion and half-man, to kill the gigantic demon. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original person, one without a second, He assumes different forms just to satisfy His devotees or to execute a specific purpose. Therefore Jayadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b always repeats the name of Ke\u015bava, the original Personality of Godhead, in his prayers describing the Lord\u2019s different incarnations for different purposes."

O my Lord who possess nails and teeth just like thunderbolts, kindly vanquish our demonlike desires for fruitive activity in this material world. Please appear in our hearts and drive away our ignorance so that by Your mercy we may become fearless in the struggle for existence in this material world.",
        "purport": " In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (4.22.39) Sanat-kum\u0101ra speaks the following words to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja P\u1e5bthu: \u201cDevotees always engaged in the service of the toes of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet can very easily become free from hard-knotted desires for fruitive activities. Because this is very difficult, the nondevotees \u2014 the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs \u2014 cannot stop the waves of sense gratification, although they try to do so. Therefore you are advised to engage in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the son of Vasudeva.\u201d Every living being within this material world has a strong desire to enjoy matter to his fullest satisfaction. For this purpose, the conditioned soul must accept one body after another, and thus his strongly fixed fruitive desires continue. One cannot stop the repetition of birth and death without being completely desireless. Therefore \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes pure bhakti (devotional service) as follows: \u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\u201d Unless one is completely freed of all material desires, which are caused by the dense darkness of ignorance, one cannot fully engage in the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore we should always offer our prayers to Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, who killed Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, the personification of material desire. Hira\u1e47ya means \u201cgold,\u201d and ka\u015bipu means \u201ca soft cushion or bed.\u201d Materialistic persons always desire to make the body comfortable, and for this they require huge amounts of gold. Thus Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was the perfect representative of materialistic life. He was therefore the cause of great disturbance to the topmost devotee, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, until Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva killed him. Any devotee aspiring to be free of material desires should offer his respectful prayers to N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva as Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did in this verse."

        "purport": " The following verse describes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava: Just like a desire tree, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava can fulfill all the desires of anyone who takes shelter of his lotus feet. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is a typical Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. He prays not for himself but for all living entities \u2014 the gentle, the envious and the mischievous. He always thought of the welfare of mischievous persons like his father, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not ask for anything for himself; rather, he prayed for the Lord to excuse his demoniac father. This is the attitude of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, who always thinks of the welfare of the entire universe. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and bh\u0101gavata-dharma are meant for persons who are completely free of envy (parama-nirmatsar\u0101\u1e47\u0101m). Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja prays in this verse, khala\u1e25 pras\u012bdat\u0101m: \u201cMay all the envious persons be pacified.\u201d The material world is full of envious persons, but if one frees himself of envy, he becomes liberal in his social dealings and can think of others\u2019 welfare. Anyone who takes up K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engages himself completely in the service of the Lord cleanses his mind of all envy (mana\u015b ca bhadra\u1e41 bhajat\u0101d adhok\u1e63aje). Therefore we should pray to Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva to sit in our hearts. We should pray, bahir n\u1e5bsi\u1e41ho h\u1e5bdaye n\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha\u1e25: \u201cLet Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva sit in the core of my heart, killing all my bad propensities. Let my mind become clean so that I may peacefully worship the Lord and bring peace to the entire world.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has given us a very fine purport in this regard. Whenever one offers a prayer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one always requests some benediction from Him. Even pure (ni\u1e63k\u0101ma) devotees pray for some benediction, as instructed by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu in His \u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka: \u201cO son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death. Please pick Me up from the ocean of death and place Me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet.\u201d In another prayer Lord Caitanya says, mama janmani janman\u012b\u015bvare bhavat\u0101d bhaktir ahaituk\u012b tvayi: \u201cLife after life, kindly let Me have unalloyed love and devotion at Your Lordship\u2019s lotus feet.\u201d When Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja chants o\u1e41 namo bhagavate narasi\u1e41h\u0101ya, he prays for a benediction from the Lord, but because he is also an exalted Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he wants nothing for his personal sense gratification. The first desire expressed in his prayer is svasty astu vi\u015bvasya: \u201cLet there be good fortune throughout the entire universe.\u201d Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja thus requested the Lord to be merciful to everyone, including his father, a most envious person. According to C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, there are two kinds of envious living entities: one is a snake, and the other is the man like Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, who is by nature envious of everyone, even of his father or son. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was envious of his little son Prahl\u0101da, but Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja asked a benediction for the benefit of his father. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was very envious of devotees, but Prahl\u0101da wished that his father and other demons like him would give up their envious nature by the grace of the Lord and stop harassing the devotees (khala\u1e25 pras\u012bdat\u0101m). The difficulty is that the khala (envious living entity) is rarely pacified. One kind of khala, the snake, can be pacified simply by mantras or by the action of a particular herb (mantrau\u1e63adhi-va\u015ba\u1e25 sarpa\u1e25 khalakena niv\u0101ryate). An envious person, however, cannot be pacified by any means. Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja prays that all envious persons may undergo a change of heart and think of the welfare of others. If the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement spreads all over the world, and if by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everyone accepts it, the thinking of envious people will change. Everyone will think of the welfare of others. Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja prays, \u015biva\u1e41 mitho dhiy\u0101. In material activities, everyone is envious of others, but in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no one is envious of anyone else; everyone thinks of the welfare of others. Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja prays that everyone\u2019s mind may become gentle by being fixed at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (bhajat\u0101d adhok\u1e63aje). As indicated elsewhere in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25) and as advised by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.65), man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakta\u1e25, one should constantly think of the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then one\u2019s mind will certainly be cleansed (ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam). Materialists always think of sense gratification, but Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja prays that the Lord\u2019s mercy will change their minds and they will stop thinking of sense gratification. If they think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always, everything will be all right. Some people argue that if everyone thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in that way, the whole universe would be vacated because everyone would go back home, back to Godhead. However, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that this is impossible because the living entities are innumerable. If one set of living entities is actually delivered by the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, another set will fill the entire universe."

        "translation": "By associating with persons for whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mukunda, is the all in all, one can hear of His powerful activities and soon come to understand them. The activities of Mukunda are so potent that simply by hearing of them one immediately associates with the Lord. For a person who constantly and very eagerly hears narrations of the Lord\u2019s powerful activities, the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead in the form of sound vibrations, enters within his heart and cleanses it of all contamination. On the other hand, although bathing in the Ganges diminishes bodily contaminations and infections, this process and the process of visiting holy places can cleanse the heart only after a long time. Therefore who is the sane man who will not associate with devotees to quickly perfect his life?",
        "purport": " Bathing in the Ganges can certainly cure one of many infectious diseases, but it cannot cleanse one\u2019s materially attached mind, which creates all kinds of contaminations in material existence. However, one who directly associates with the Supreme Lord by hearing of His activities cleanses the dirt from his mind and very soon comes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b confirms this in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.17): The Supreme Lord within everyone\u2019s heart becomes very pleased when a person hears narrations of His activities, and He personally cleanses the dirt from the mind of the listener. H\u1e5bdy anta\u1e25-stho hy abhadr\u0101\u1e47i vidhunoti: He washes off all dirt from the mind. Material existence is caused by dirty things within the mind. If one can cleanse his mind, he immediately comes to his original position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thus his life becomes successful. Therefore all the great saints in the devotional line very strongly recommend the process of hearing. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu introduced the congregational chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra to give everyone a chance to hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s holy name, for simply by hearing Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, one becomes purified (ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam). Therefore our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is chiefly engaged in chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra all over the world. After one\u2019s mind becomes cleansed by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one gradually comes to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and then reads books like Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta and The Nectar of Devotion. In this way, one becomes more and more purified of material contamination. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.18): \u201cBy regularly hearing the Bh\u0101gavatam and rendering service unto the pure devotee, all that is troublesome to the heart is practically destroyed, and loving service unto the glorious Lord, who is praised with transcendental songs, is established as an irrevocable fact.\u201d In this way, simply by hearing of the powerful activities of the Lord, the devotee\u2019s heart becomes almost completely cleansed of material contamination, and thus his original position as an eternal servant who is part and parcel of the Lord becomes manifest. While the devotee engages in devotional service, the passionate and ignorant modes of material nature are gradually vanquished, and then he acts only in the mode of goodness. At that time he becomes happy and gradually advances in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. All the great \u0101c\u0101ryas strongly recommend that people be given a chance to hear about the Supreme Lord. Then success is assured. The more we cleanse the dirt of material attachment from our hearts, the more we will be attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and activities. This is the sum and substance of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement."

        "translation": "All the demigods and their exalted qualities, such as religion, knowledge and renunciation, become manifest in the body of one who has developed unalloyed devotion for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva. On the other hand, a person devoid of devotional service and engaged in material activities has no good qualities. Even if he is adept at the practice of mystic yoga or the honest endeavor of maintaining his family and relatives, he must be driven by his own mental speculations and must engage in the service of the Lord\u2019s external energy. How can there be any good qualities in such a man?",
        "purport": " As explained in the next verse, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original source of all living entities. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7), wherein K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\u201d All living entities are part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore when they revive their original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, they possess all the good qualities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a small quantity. When one engages himself in the nine processes of devotional service (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam/ arcana\u1e41 vandana\u1e41 d\u0101sya\u1e41 sakhyam \u0101tma-nivedanam), one\u2019s heart becomes purified, and he immediately understands his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He then revives his original quality of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In the \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101 of Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, Chapter Eight, there is a description of some of the qualities of devotees. For example, \u015ar\u012b Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita Harid\u0101sa is described as being very well-behaved, tolerant, peaceful, magnanimous and grave. In addition, he spoke very sweetly, his endeavors were very pleasing, he was always patient, he respected everyone, he always worked for everyone\u2019s benefit, his mind was free of duplicity, and he was completely devoid of all malicious activities. These are all originally qualities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when one becomes a devotee they automatically become manifest. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja, the author of Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, says that all good qualities become manifest in the body of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and that only by the presence of these good qualities can one distinguish a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava from a non-Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja lists the following twenty-six good qualities of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava: (1) He is very kind to everyone. (2) He does not make anyone his enemy. (3) He is truthful. (4) He is equal to everyone. (5) No one can find any fault in him. (6) He is magnanimous. (7) He is mild. (8) He is always clean. (9) He is without possessions. (10) He works for everyone\u2019s benefit. (11) He is very peaceful. (12) He is always surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. (13) He has no material desires. (14) He is very meek. (15) He is steady. (16) He controls his senses. (17) He does not eat more than required. (18) He is not influenced by the Lord\u2019s illusory energy. (19) He offers respect to everyone. (20) He does not desire any respect for himself. (21) He is very grave. (22) He is merciful. (23) He is friendly. (24) He is poetic. (25) He is expert. (26) He is silent."

        "purport": " Although crocodiles are very fierce animals, they are powerless when they venture out of the water onto land. When they are out of the water, they cannot exhibit their original power. Similarly, the all-pervading Supersoul, Param\u0101tm\u0101, is the source of all living entities, and all living entities are part and parcel of Him. When the living entity remains in contact with the all-pervading V\u0101sudeva, the Personality of Godhead, he manifests his spiritual power, exactly as the crocodile exhibits its strength in the water. In other words, the greatness of the living entity can be perceived when he is in the spiritual world, engaged in spiritual activities. Many householders, although well-educated in the knowledge of the Vedas, become attached to family life. They are compared herein to crocodiles out of water, for they are devoid of all spiritual strength. Their greatness is like that of a young husband and wife who, though uneducated, praise one another and become attracted to their own temporary beauty. This kind of greatness is appreciated only by low-class men with no qualifications. Everyone should therefore seek the shelter of the Supreme Soul, the source of all living entities. No one should waste his time in the so-called happiness of materialistic household life. In the Vedic civilization, this type of crippled life is allowed only until one\u2019s fiftieth year, when one must give up family life and enter either the order of v\u0101naprastha (independent retired life for cultivation of spiritual knowledge) or sanny\u0101sa (the renounced order, in which one completely takes shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead)."

As the supreme master of all bodily, mental and intellectual activities, He is the only enjoyer of their results. The five sense objects and eleven senses, including the mind, are His partial manifestations. He supplies all the necessities of life, which are His energy and thus nondifferent from Him, and He is the cause of everyone\u2019s bodily and mental prowess, which is also nondifferent from Him. Indeed, He is the husband and provider of necessities for all living entities. The purpose of all the Vedas is to worship Him. Therefore let us all offer Him our respectful obeisances. May He always be favorable toward us in this life and the next.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word m\u0101y\u0101maya is further explained in regard to how the Lord expands His mercy in different ways. Par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate: the energies of the Supreme Lord are understood in different ways. In this verse He is described as the original source of everything, even our body, senses, mind, activities, prowess, bodily strength, mental strength and determination for securing the necessities of life. Indeed, the Lord\u2019s energies can be perceived in everything. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.8), raso\u00a0\u2019ham apsu kaunteya: the taste of water is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the active principle of everything we need for our maintenance. This verse offering respectful obeisances unto the Lord was composed by Ram\u0101, the goddess of fortune, and is full of spiritual power. Under the guidance of a spiritual master, everyone should chant this mantra and thus become a complete and perfect devotee of the Lord. One may chant this mantra for complete liberation from material bondage, and after liberation one may continue to chant it while worshiping the Supreme Lord in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. All mantras, of course, are meant for this life and the next life, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself confirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.14): \u201cAlways chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, the great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.\u201d A devotee who both in this life and the next chants the mah\u0101-mantra, or any mantra, is called nitya-yuktop\u0101saka."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, You are certainly the fully independent master of all the senses. Therefore all women who worship You by strictly observing vows because they wish to acquire a husband to satisfy their senses are surely under illusion. They do not know that such a husband cannot actually give protection to them or their children. Nor can he protect their wealth or duration of life, for he himself is dependent on time, fruitive results and the modes of nature, which are all subordinate to You.",
        "purport": " In this verse, Lak\u1e63m\u012bdev\u012b (Ram\u0101) shows compassion toward women who worship the Lord for the benediction of possessing a good husband. Although such women desire to be happy with children, wealth, a long duration of life and everything dear to them, they cannot possibly do so. In the material world, a so-called husband is dependent on the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of a woman whose husband, being dependent on the result of his own fruitive actions, cannot maintain his wife, her children, her wealth or her duration of life. Therefore, factually the only real husband of all women is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme husband. Because the gop\u012bs were liberated souls, they understood this fact. Therefore they rejected their material husbands and accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as their real husband. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the real husband not only of the gop\u012bs, but of every living entity. Everyone should perfectly understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the real husband of all living entities, who are described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as prak\u1e5bti (female), not puru\u1e63a (male). In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.12), only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is addressed as puru\u1e63a: \u201cYou are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading beauty.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original puru\u1e63a, and the living entities are prak\u1e5bti. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the enjoyer, and all living entities are meant to be enjoyed by Him. Therefore any woman who seeks a material husband for her protection, or any man who desires to become the husband of a woman, is under illusion. To become a husband means to maintain a wife and children nicely by supplying wealth and security. However, a material husband cannot possibly do this, for he is dependent on his karma. Karma\u1e47\u0101-daiva-netre\u1e47a: his circumstances are determined by his past fruitive activities. Therefore if one proudly thinks he can protect his wife, he is under illusion. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only husband, and therefore the relationship between a husband and wife in this material world cannot be absolute. Because we have the desire to marry, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mercifully allows the so-called husband to possess a wife, and the wife to possess a so-called husband, for mutual satisfaction. In the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad it is said, tena tyaktena bhu\u00f1j\u012bth\u0101: the Lord provides everyone with his quota. Actually, however, every living entity is prak\u1e5bti, or female, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only husband. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original master or husband of everyone, and all other living entities, having taken the form of so-called husbands, or wives, are dancing according to His desire. A so-called husband may unite with his wife for sense gratification, but his senses are conducted by H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the master of the senses, who is therefore the actual husband."

Therefore persons learned in all Vedic literature accept only Your Lordship as everyone\u2019s master, and they think no one else a better husband and protector than You.",
        "purport": " Here the meaning of husband or guardian is clearly explained. People want to become a husband, a guardian, a governor or a political leader without knowing the actual meaning of such a superior position. There are many people all over the world \u2014 indeed, throughout the universe \u2014 who claim for some time that they are husbands, political leaders or guardians, but in due course of time the Supreme Lord desires their removal from their posts, and their careers are immediately finished. Therefore those who are actually learned and advanced in spiritual life do not accept any leader, husband or maintainer other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66), aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi: \u201cI shall deliver you from all sinful reactions.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not afraid of anyone.

Na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um: people do not know that real advancement in life consists of accepting the Supreme Personality of Godhead as one\u2019s master.

        "translation": "My dear Lord, You automatically fulfill all the desires of a woman who worships Your lotus feet in pure love. However, if a woman worships Your lotus feet for a particular purpose, You also quickly fulfill her desires, but in the end she becomes broken-hearted and laments. Therefore one need not worship Your lotus feet for some material benefit.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes pure devotional service as any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam. One should not worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead to fulfill some material desire for success in fruitive activities or mental speculation. To serve the lotus feet of the Lord means to serve Him exactly as He desires. The neophyte devotee is therefore ordered to worship the Lord strictly according to the regulative principles given by the spiritual master and the \u015b\u0101stras. By executing devotional service in that way, he gradually becomes attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when his original dormant love for the Lord becomes manifest, he spontaneously serves the Lord without any motive. This condition is the perfect stage of one\u2019s relationship with the Lord. The Lord then looks after the comfort and security of His devotee without being asked. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a promises in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.22): The Supreme Lord personally takes care of anyone who is completely engaged in His devotional service. Whatever he has, the Lord protects, and whatever he needs, the Lord supplies. Therefore why should one bother the Lord for something material? Such prayers are unnecessary. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that even if a devotee wishes the Lord to fulfill a particular desire, the devotee should not be considered a sak\u0101ma-bhakta (a devotee with some motive). In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.16) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cO best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me \u2014 the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.\u201d The \u0101rta and the arth\u0101rth\u012b, who approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for relief from misery or for some money, are not sak\u0101ma-bhaktas, although they appear to be. Being neophyte devotees, they are simply ignorant. Later in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, ud\u0101r\u0101\u1e25 sarva evaite: they are all magnanimous (ud\u0101r\u0101\u1e25). Although in the beginning a devotee may harbor some desire, in due course of time it will vanish. Therefore the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam enjoins: \u201cA person who has broader intelligence, whether he is full of all material desire, is free from material desire, or has a desire for liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.3.10) Even if one wants something material, he should pray to no one but the Lord to fulfill his desire. If one approaches a demigod for the fulfillment of his desires, he is to be considered na\u1e63\u1e6da-buddhi, bereft of all good sense. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20): \u201cThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.\u201d Lak\u1e63m\u012bdev\u012b advises all devotees who approach the Lord with material desires that according to her practical experience, the Lord is K\u0101madeva, and thus there is no need to ask Him for anything material. She says that everyone should simply serve the Lord without any motive. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is sitting in everyone\u2019s heart, He knows everyone\u2019s thoughts, and in due course of time He will fulfill all desires. Therefore let us completely depend on the service of the Lord without bothering Him with our material requests."

        "purport": " In this verse the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012bdev\u012b, clearly states that she does not bestow her favor on any materialistic person. Although sometimes a materialist becomes very opulent in the eyes of another materialist, such opulence is bestowed upon him by the goddess Durg\u0101dev\u012b, a material expansion of the goddess of fortune, not by Lak\u1e63m\u012bdev\u012b herself. Those who desire material wealth worship Durg\u0101dev\u012b with the following mantra: dhana\u1e41 dehi r\u016bpa\u1e41 dehi rupavati bharyam dehi. \u201cO worshipable mother Durg\u0101dev\u012b, please give me wealth, strength, fame, a good wife and so on.\u201d By pleasing Goddess Durg\u0101 one can obtain such benefits, but since they are temporary, they result only in m\u0101y\u0101-sukha (illusory happiness). As stated by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, m\u0101y\u0101-sukh\u0101ya bharam udvahato vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101n: those who work very hard for material benefits are vim\u016b\u1e0dhas, foolish rascals, because such happiness will not endure. On the other hand, devotees like Prahl\u0101da and Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja achieved extraordinary material opulences, but such opulences were not m\u0101y\u0101-sukha. When a devotee acquires unparalleled opulences, they are the direct gifts of the goddess of fortune, who resides in the heart of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. The material opulences a person obtains by offering prayers to the goddess Durg\u0101 are temporary. As described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.23), antavat tu phala\u1e41 te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 tad bhavaty alpa-medhas\u0101m: men of meager intelligence desire temporary happiness. We have actually seen that one of the disciples of Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura wanted to enjoy the property of his spiritual master, and the spiritual master, being merciful toward him, gave him the temporary property, but not the power to preach the cult of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu all over the world. That special mercy of the power to preach is given to a devotee who does not want anything material from his spiritual master but wants only to serve him. The story of the demon R\u0101va\u1e47a illustrates this point. Although R\u0101va\u1e47a tried to abduct the goddess of fortune S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b from the custody of Lord R\u0101macandra, he could not possibly do so. The S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b he forcibly took with him was not the original S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b, but an expansion of m\u0101y\u0101, or Durg\u0101dev\u012b. As a result, instead of winning the favor of the real goddess of fortune, R\u0101va\u1e47a and his whole family were vanquished by the power of Durg\u0101dev\u012b (s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di-sthiti-pralaya-s\u0101dhana-\u015baktir ek\u0101)."

        "purport": " In many places, the \u015b\u0101stras describe the Supreme Personality of Godhead as being more inclined toward His devotees than toward His wife, who always remains on His chest. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.14.15) it is stated: Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a plainly says that His devotees are more dear to Him than Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, Lord Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a (the original cause of creation), the goddess of fortune or even His own Self. Elsewhere in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.9.20) \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says: The Supreme Lord, who can award liberation to anyone, showed more mercy toward the gop\u012bs than to Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva or even the goddess of fortune, who is His own wife and is associated with His body. Similarly, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.47.60) also states: \u201cThe gop\u012bs received benedictions from the Lord that neither Lak\u1e63m\u012bdev\u012b nor the most beautiful dancers in the heavenly planets could attain. In the r\u0101sa dance, the Lord showed His favor to the most fortunate gop\u012bs by placing His arms on their shoulders and dancing with each of them individually. No one can compare with the gop\u012bs, who received the causeless mercy of the Lord.\u201d In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that no one can receive the real favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead without following in the footsteps of the gop\u012bs. Even the goddess of fortune could not receive the same favor as the gop\u012bs, although she underwent severe austerities and penances for many years. Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu discusses this point with Vye\u1e45ka\u1e6da Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 9.111-131): \u201cThe Lord inquired from Vye\u1e45ka\u1e6da Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da,\u00a0\u2018Your worshipable goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, always remains on the chest of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and she is certainly the most chaste woman in the creation. However, My Lord is Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, a cowherd boy engaged in tending cows. Why is it that Lak\u1e63m\u012b, being such a chaste wife, wants to associate with My Lord? Just to associate with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lak\u1e63m\u012b abandoned all transcendental happiness in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and for a long time accepted vows and regulative principles and performed unlimited austerities.\u2019 \u201cVye\u1e45ka\u1e6da Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da replied,\u00a0\u2018Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a are one and the same, but the pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are more relishable due to their sportive nature. They are very pleasing for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s \u015baktis. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a are both the same personality, Lak\u1e63m\u012b\u2019s association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not break her vow of chastity. Rather, it was in great fun that the goddess of fortune wanted to associate with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The goddess of fortune considered that her vow of chastity would not be damaged by her relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Rather, by associating with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a she could enjoy the benefit of the r\u0101sa dance. If she wanted to enjoy herself with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a what fault is there? Why are you joking so about this?\u2019 \u201cLord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu replied,\u00a0\u2018I know that there is no fault in the goddess of fortune, but still she could not enter into the r\u0101sa dance. We hear this from revealed scriptures. The authorities of Vedic knowledge met Lord R\u0101macandra in Da\u1e47\u1e0dak\u0101ra\u1e47ya, and by their penances and austerities, they were allowed to enter into the r\u0101sa dance. But can you tell me why the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, could not get that opportunity?\u2019 \u201cTo this Vye\u1e45ka\u1e6da Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da replied,\u00a0\u2018I cannot enter into the mystery of this incident. I am an ordinary living being. My intelligence is limited, and I am always disturbed. How can I understand the pastimes of the Supreme Lord? They are deeper than millions of oceans.\u2019 \u201cLord Caitanya replied,\u00a0\u2018Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has a specific characteristic. He attracts everyone\u2019s heart by the mellow of His personal conjugal love. By following in the footsteps of the inhabitants of the planet known as Vrajaloka or Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, one can attain the shelter of the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. However, the inhabitants of that planet do not know that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unaware that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord, the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana like Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Ya\u015bod\u0101dev\u012b and the gop\u012bs treat K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as their beloved son or lover. Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 accepts Him as her son and sometimes binds Him to a grinding mortar. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s cowherd boyfriends think He is an ordinary boy and get up on His shoulders. In Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana no one has any desire other than to love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u2019\u201d The conclusion is that one cannot associate with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a unless he has fully received the favor of the inhabitants of Vrajabh\u016bmi. Therefore if one wants to be delivered by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly, he must take to the service of the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, who are unalloyed devotees of the Lord."

        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is antarbahi\u1e25, present within and without everything. One must overcome the delusion caused by the Lord\u2019s external energy and realize His presence both externally and internally. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.8.19) \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Kunt\u012bdev\u012b has explained that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in this world na\u1e6do n\u0101\u1e6dyadharo yath\u0101, \u201cexactly like an actor dressed as a player.\u201d In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sama-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be\u00a0\u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati: \u201cThe Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, O Arjuna.\u201d The Lord is situated within everyone\u2019s heart, and outside as well. Within the heart He is the Supersoul, the incarnation who acts as the adviser and witness. Yet although God is residing within their hearts, foolish people say, \u201cI cannot see God. Please show Him to me.\u201d Everyone is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly like dancing dolls controlled by a puppeteer or a woman controlled by her husband. A woman is compared to a doll (d\u0101rumay\u012b) because she has no independence. She should always be controlled by a man. Still, due to false prestige, a class of women wants to remain independent. What to speak of women, all living entities are prak\u1e5bti (female) and therefore dependent on the Supreme Lord, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself explains in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (apareyam itas tv any\u0101\u1e41 prak\u1e5bti\u1e41 viddhi me par\u0101m). The living entity is never independent. Under all circumstances, he is dependent on the mercy of the Lord. The Lord creates the social divisions of human society \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras \u2014 and ordains that they follow rules and regulations suited to their particular position. In this way, all members of society remain always under the Supreme Lord\u2019s control. Still, some people foolishly deny the existence of God. Self-realization means to understand one\u2019s subordinate position in relation to the Lord. When one is thus enlightened, he surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is liberated from the clutches of the material energy. In other words, unless one surrenders to the lotus feet of the Lord, the material energy in its many varieties will continue to control him. No one in the material world can deny that he is under control. The Supreme Lord, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, who is beyond this material existence, controls everyone. The following Vedic mantra confirms this point: eko ha vai n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u0101s\u012bt. Foolish persons think N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a to be on the platform of ordinary material existence. Because they do not realize the natural constitutional position of the living entity, they concoct names like daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, sv\u0101m\u012b-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a or mithy\u0101-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. However, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is actually the supreme controller of everyone. This understanding is self-realization."

Without Your help, however, they could neither separately nor concertedly maintain the innumerable living entities within the universe. You are actually the only maintainer of all human beings, of animals like cows and asses, and of plants, reptiles, birds, mountains and whatever else is visible within this material world.",
        "purport": " It is fashionable for materialistic persons to compete with the power of God. When so-called scientists try to manufacture living entities in their laboratories, their only purpose is to defy the talent and ability of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called illusion. It exists even in the higher planetary systems, where great demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and others reside. In this world everyone is puffed up with false prestige despite the failure of all his endeavors. When so-called philanthropists, who supposedly want to help the poor, are approached by members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, they say, \u201cYou are simply wasting your time, while I am feeding vast masses of starving people.\u201d Unfortunately, their meager efforts, either singly or together, do not solve anyone\u2019s problems. Sometimes so-called sv\u0101m\u012bs are very eager to feed poor people, thinking them to be daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Lord\u2019s incarnations as beggars. They prefer to serve the manufactured daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a than the original, supreme N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. They say, \u201cDon\u2019t encourage service to Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. It is better to serve the starving people of the world.\u201d Unfortunately such materialists, either singly or combined in the form of the United Nations, cannot fulfill their plans. The truth is that the many millions of human beings, animals, birds and trees \u2014 indeed, all living entities \u2014 are maintained solely by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n: one person, the Supreme Lord, is supplying the necessities of life for all other living entities. To challenge the authority of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the business of asuras (demons). Yet sometimes suras, or devotees, are also bewildered by the illusory energy and falsely claim to be the maintainer of the entire universe. Such incidents are described in the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, where \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells how Lord Brahm\u0101 and King Indra became puffed up and were eventually chastised by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

Because of an atheistic mentality, some people think that the tortoise, boar and fish incarnations of the Lord are not very beautiful. They do not know that any form of the Lord is always the fully opulent Personality of Godhead. Since one of His opulences is infinite beauty, all the Lord\u2019s incarnations are very beautiful and are appreciated as such by devotees. Nondevotees, however, think that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s incarnations are ordinary material creatures, and therefore they distinguish between the beautiful and the not beautiful. A certain form of the Lord is worshiped by a particular devotee because he loves to see that form of the Lord.

Anyone can understand that the original fire is the reality and that the heat and light are simply the fire\u2019s energy. Heat and light are the formless energies of fire, and in that sense they are unreal. Only the fire has form, and therefore it is the real form of the heat and light. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.4), may\u0101 tatam ida\u1e41 sarva\u1e41 jagad avyakta-m\u016brtin\u0101: \u201cBy Me, in My unmanifested form. this entire universe is pervaded.\u201d Thus the impersonal conception of the Lord is like the expansion of heat and light from a fire. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord also says, mat-sth\u0101ni sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni na c\u0101ha\u1e41 te\u1e63v avasthita\u1e25: the entire material creation is resting on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, either material, spiritual or marginal, but because His form is absent from the expansion of His energy, He is not personally present. This inconceivable expansion of the Supreme Lord\u2019s energy is called acintya-\u015bakti. Therefore no one can understand the real form of the Lord without becoming His devotee."

        "purport": " This verse completely rejects the theory of brahma satya\u1e41 jagan mithy\u0101, which states that spirit, or Brahman, is real, whereas the manifested material world, with its great variety of things, is false. Nothing is false. One thing may be permanent and another temporary, but both the permanent and the temporary are facts. For example, if someone becomes angry for a certain period, no one can say that his anger is false. It is simply temporary. Everything we experience in our daily lives is of this same character; it is temporary but real. The different kinds of living entities coming from various sources are very clearly described in this verse. Some are born from a womb and some (like certain insects) from human perspiration. Others hatch from eggs, and still others sprout from the earth. A living entity takes birth under different circumstances according to his past activities (karma). Although the body of the living entity is material, it is never false. No one will accept the argument that since a person\u2019s material body is false, murder has no repercussions. Our temporary bodies are given to us according to our karma, and we must remain in our given bodies to enjoy the pains and pleasures of life. Our bodies cannot be called false; they are only temporary. In other words, the energy of the Supreme Lord is as permanent as the Lord Himself, although His energy is sometimes manifest and sometimes not. As summarized in the Vedas, sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma: \u201cEverything is Brahman.\u201d"

Exactly as a piece of iron moves under the influence of a lodestone, inert matter moves when You glance over the total material energy.",
        "purport": " Sometimes the question arises why the Supreme Lord has created this material world, which is so full of suffering for the living entities entrapped in it. The answer given herein is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not wish to create this material world just to inflict suffering on the living entities. The Supreme Lord creates this world only because the conditioned souls want to enjoy it. The workings of nature are not going on automatically. It is only because the Lord glances over the material energy that it acts in wonderful ways, just as a lodestone causes a piece of iron to move here and there. Because materialistic scientists and so-called S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophers do not believe in God, they think that material nature is working without supervision. But that is not the fact. In Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 6.18-19) the creation of the material world is explained as follows: \u201cAtheistic S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophers think that the total material energy causes the cosmic manifestation, but they are wrong. Dead matter has no moving power, and therefore it cannot act independently. The Lord infuses the material ingredients with His own creative potency. Then, by the power of the Lord, matter moves and interacts.\u201d Sea waves are moved by the air, the air is created from ether, the ether is produced by the agitation of the three modes of material nature, and the three modes of material nature interact due to the Supreme Lord\u2019s glance over the total material energy. Therefore the background of all natural occurrences is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram). This is also further explained in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 5.59-61): \u201cBecause prak\u1e5bti [material nature] is dull and inert, it cannot actually be the cause of the material world. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a shows His mercy by infusing His energy into the dull, inert material nature. Thus prak\u1e5bti, by the energy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, becomes the secondary cause, just as iron becomes red-hot by the energy of fire. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original cause of the cosmic manifestation. Prak\u1e5bti is like the nipples on the neck of a goat, for they cannot give any milk.\u201d Thus it is a great mistake on the part of the material scientists and philosophers to think that matter moves independently."
