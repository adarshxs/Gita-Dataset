Actually the animal was offered in the sacrificial fire to get a rejuvenated life. Generally an old animal was sacrificed in the fire, and it would come out again in a youthful body. Some of the rituals however, did not require animal sacrifice. In the present age, animal sacrifices are forbidden. As stated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: \u201cIn this Age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of sanny\u0101sa, the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man\u2019s begetting children in his brother\u2019s wife.\u201d (Cc. \u0100di 17.164) Such sacrifices are impossible in this age due to the scarcity of expert br\u0101hma\u1e47as or \u1e5btvija\u1e25 who are able to take the responsibility. In the absence of these, the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a is recommended. Yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 11.5.32).

In this Age of Kali, the Supreme Lord in His incarnation of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu should be worshiped with His associates by performance of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, the congregational chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. This process is accepted by intelligent men. Yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25. The word sumedhasa\u1e25 refers to intelligent men who possess very good brain substance."

        "translation": "After performing the preliminaries of various sacrifices, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata offered the results in the name of religion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva. In other words, he performed all the yaj\u00f1as for the satisfaction of Lord V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata thought that since the demigods were different parts of V\u0101sudeva\u2019s body, He controls those who are explained in the Vedic mantras. By thinking in this way, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata was freed from all material contamination, such as attachment, lust and greed. When the priests were about to offer the sacrificial ingredients into the fire, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata expertly understood how the offering made to different demigods was simply an offering to the different limbs of the Lord. For instance, Indra is the arm of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and S\u016brya [the sun] is His eye. Thus Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata considered that the oblations offered to different demigods were actually offered unto the different limbs of Lord V\u0101sudeva.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead says that as long as one does not develop the pure devotional service of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam, hearing and chanting, one must carry out his prescribed duties. Since Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a great devotee, one may ask why he performed so many sacrifices that are actually meant for karm\u012bs. The fact is that he was simply following the orders of V\u0101sudeva. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sarva dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.\u201d (Bg. 18.66) Whatever we do, we should constantly remember V\u0101sudeva. People are generally addicted to offering obeisances to various demigods, but Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja simply wanted to please Lord V\u0101sudeva. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram (Bg. 5.29). A yaj\u00f1a may be carried out to satisfy a particular demigod, but when the yaj\u00f1a is offered to the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the demigods are satisfied. The purpose of performing different yaj\u00f1as is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. One may perform them in the name of different demigods or directly. If we directly offer oblations to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods are automatically satisfied. If we water the root of a tree, the branches, twigs, fruits and flowers are automatically satisfied. When one offers sacrifices to different demigods, one should remember that the demigods are simply parts of the body of the Supreme. If we worship the hand of a person, we intend to satisfy the person himself. If we massage a person\u2019s legs, we do not really serve the legs but the person who possesses the legs. All the demigods are different parts of the Lord, and if we offer service to them, we actually serve the Lord Himself. Demigod worship is mentioned in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, but actually the \u015blokas advocate worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda. For instance, worship of the goddess Durg\u0101 is mentioned this way in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.44): Following the orders of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the goddess Durg\u0101 creates, maintains and annihilates. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also confirms this statement in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. May\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram: \u201cThis material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt\u012b, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings.\u201d (Bg. 9.10) We should worship the demigods in that spirit. Because the goddess Durg\u0101 satisfies K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we should therefore offer respects to Goddess Durg\u0101. Because Lord \u015aiva is nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s functional body, we should therefore offer respects to Lord \u015aiva. Similarly, we should offer respects to Brahm\u0101, Agni and S\u016brya. There are many offerings to different demigods, and one should always remember that these offerings are usually meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not aspire to receive some benediction from demigods. His aim was to please the Supreme Lord. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, among the thousand names of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it is said yaj\u00f1a-bhug yaj\u00f1a-k\u1e5bd yaj\u00f1a\u1e25. The enjoyer of yaj\u00f1a, the performer of yaj\u00f1a and yaj\u00f1a itself are the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the performer of everything, but out of ignorance the living entity thinks that he is the actor. As long as we think we are the actors, we bring about karma-bandha (bondage to activity). If we act for yaj\u00f1a, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is no karma-bandha. Yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25: \u201cWork done as a sacrifice for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has to be performed; otherwise work binds one to this material world.\u201d (Bg. 3.9) Following the instructions of Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, we should act not for our personal satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (17.28) it is also stated: Sacrifices, austerities and charities performed without faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead are nonpermanent. Regardless of whatever rituals are performed, they are called asat, nonpermanent. They are therefore useless both in this life and the next. Kings like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a and many other r\u0101jar\u1e63is who were pure devotees of the Lord simply passed their time in the service of the Supreme Lord. When a pure devotee executes some service through the agency of another person, he should not be criticized, for his activities are meant for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. A devotee may have a priest perform some karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, and the priest may not be a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, but because the devotee wants to please the Supreme Lord, he should not be criticized. The word ap\u016brva is very significant. The resultant actions of karma are called ap\u016brva. When we act piously or impiously, immediate results do not ensue. We therefore wait for the results, which are called ap\u016brva. The results are manifest in the future. Even the sm\u0101rtas accept this ap\u016brva. Pure devotees simply act for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the results of their activities are spiritual, or permanent. They are not like those of the karm\u012bs, which are nonpermanent. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.23): \u201cThe work of a man who is unattached to the modes of material nature and who is fully situated in transcendental knowledge merges entirely into transcendence.\u201d A devotee is always free from material contamination. He is fully situated in knowledge, and therefore his sacrifices are intended for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

This is obtainable only when one is completely freed from the desire for material sense gratification and is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toya\u1e41 yo me bhakty\u0101 prayacchati. Worship of the Lord is not at all expensive. One can offer the Lord a leaf, a flower, a little fruit and some water. The Supreme Lord accepts these offerings when they are offered with love and devotion. In this way, one can become freed from material desires. As long as one maintains material desires, he cannot be happy. As soon as one engages in the devotional service of the Lord, his mind is purified of all material desires. Then one becomes fully satisfied. \u201cThe supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self. By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.6-7) These are the instructions given in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the supreme Vedic literature. One may not be able to go to Pulaha-\u0101\u015brama, but wherever one is one can happily render devotional service to the Lord by adopting the processes mentioned above."

As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.35), a\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham: \u201cHe enters the universe and the atom as well.\u201d In the \u1e5ag Veda, the predominating Deity of the sun is worshiped by this mantra: dhyeya\u1e25 sad\u0101 savit\u1e5b-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala-madhya-vart\u012b n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 sarasij\u0101sana-sannivi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a sits on His lotus flower within the sun. By reciting this mantra, every living entity should take shelter of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a just as the sun rises. According to modern scientists, the material world rests on the sun\u2019s effulgence. Due to the sunshine, all planets are rotating and vegetables are growing. We also have information that the moonshine helps vegetables and herbs grow. Actually N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a within the sun is maintaining the entire universe; therefore N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a should be worshiped by the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra or the \u1e5ag mantra."
