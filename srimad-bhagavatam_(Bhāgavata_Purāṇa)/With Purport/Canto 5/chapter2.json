Strictly observing the principles of religion, he gave full protection to the inhabitants of Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa as if they were his own begotten sons.",
        "purport": " Following the instruction of his father, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u0100gn\u012bdhra ruled the inhabitants of Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa according to religious principles. These principles are exactly contrary to the modern principles of faithlessness. As clearly stated here, the King protected the citizens the way a father protects his begotten children. How he ruled the citizens is also described here \u2014 dharm\u0101vek\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25, strictly according to religious principles. It is the duty of the executive head of a state to see that the citizens strictly follow religious principles. The Vedic religious principles begin with var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, the duties of the four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas. Dharma refers to principles given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The first principle of dharma, or religion, is to observe the duties of the four orders as enjoined by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to people\u2019s qualities and activities, society should be divided into br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras and then again into brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, g\u1e5bhasthas, v\u0101naprasthas and sanny\u0101s\u012bs. These are religious principles, and it is the duty of the head of state to see that his citizens strictly follow them. He should not merely act officially; he should be like a father who is always a well-wisher of his sons. Such a father strictly observes whether his sons are performing their duties, and sometimes he also punishes them. Just contrary to the principles mentioned here, the presidents and chief executives in the Age of Kali are simply tax collectors who do not care whether religious principles are observed. Indeed, the chief executives of the present day introduce all kinds of sinful activity, especially illicit sex, intoxication, animal killing and gambling. These sinful activities are now very prominently manifested in India. Although a hundred years ago these four principles of sinful life were strictly prohibited in the families of India, they have now been introduced into every Indian family; therefore they cannot follow religious principles. In contrast to the principles of the kings of old, the modern state is concerned only with propaganda for levying taxes and is no longer responsible for the spiritual welfare of the citizens. The state is now callous to religious principles. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam predicts that in Kali-yuga the government will be entrusted with dasyu-dharma, which means the occupational duty of rogues and thieves. Modern heads of state are rogues and thieves who plunder the citizens instead of giving them protection. Rogues and thieves plunder without regard for law, but in this Age of Kali, as stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the lawmakers themselves plunder the citizens. The next prediction to be fulfilled, which is already coming to pass, is that because of the sinful activities of the citizens and the government, rain will become increasingly scarce. Gradually there will be complete drought and no production of food grains. People will be reduced to eating flesh and seeds, and many good, spiritually inclined people will have to forsake their homes because they will be too harassed by drought, taxation and famine. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is the only hope to save the world from such devastation. It is the most scientific and authorized movement for the actual welfare of the whole human society."

He went to a valley of Mandara Hill, where the damsels of the heavenly planets come down to stroll. There he collected garden flowers and other necessary paraphernalia and then engaged in severe austerities and worship.",
        "purport": " The King became pit\u1e5bloka-k\u0101ma, or desirous of being transferred to the planet named Pit\u1e5bloka. Pit\u1e5bloka is mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n pit\u1e5dn y\u0101nti pit\u1e5b-vrat\u0101\u1e25). To go to this planet, one needs very good sons who can make offerings to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and then offer the remnants to their forefathers. The purpose of the \u015br\u0101ddha ceremony is to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, so that after pleasing Him one may offer pras\u0101da to one\u2019s forefathers and in this way make them happy. The inhabitants of Pit\u1e5bloka are generally men of the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bya, or fruitive activities category, who have been transferred there because of their pious activities. They can stay there as long as their descendants offer them vi\u1e63\u1e47u-pras\u0101da. Everyone in heavenly planets such as Pit\u1e5bloka, however, must return to earth after exhausting the effects of his pious acts. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.21), k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti: persons who perform pious acts are transferred to higher planets, but when the effects of their pious acts are over, they are again transferred to earth. Since Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata was a great devotee, how could he have begotten a son who desired to be transferred to Pit\u1e5bloka? Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, pit\u1e5dn y\u0101nti pit\u1e5b-vrat\u0101\u1e25: persons who desire to go to Pit\u1e5bloka are transferred there. Similarly, y\u0101nti mad-y\u0101jino\u00a0\u2019pi m\u0101m: persons who desire to be transferred to the spiritual planets, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas, can also go there. Since Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u0100gn\u012bdhra was the son of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he should have desired to be transferred to the spiritual world, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. Why, then, did he desire to be transferred to Pit\u1e5bloka? In answer to this, Gosv\u0101m\u012b Giridhara, one of the Bh\u0101gavatam commentators, remarks that \u0100gn\u012bdhra was born when Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Priyavrata was infatuated by lusty desires. This may be accepted as a fact because sons are begotten with different mentalities according to the time of their conception. According to the Vedic system, therefore, before a child is conceived, the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra is performed. This ceremony molds the mentality of the father in such a way that when he plants his seed in the womb of his wife, he will beget a child whose mind will be completely saturated with a devotional attitude. At the present moment, however, there are no such garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras, and therefore people generally have a lusty attitude when they beget children. Especially in this Age of Kali, there are no garbh\u0101dh\u0101na ceremonies; everyone enjoys sex with his wife like a cat or dog. Therefore according to \u015b\u0101stric injunctions, almost all the people of this age belong to the \u015b\u016bdra category. Of course, although Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u0100gn\u012bdhra had a desire to be transferred to Pit\u1e5bloka, this does not mean that his mentality was that of a \u015b\u016bdra; he was a k\u1e63atriya. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u0100gn\u012bdhra desired to be transferred to Pit\u1e5bloka, and therefore he needed a wife because anyone desiring to be transferred to Pit\u1e5bloka must leave behind a good son to offer yearly pi\u1e47\u1e0da, or pras\u0101da from Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. To have a good son, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u0100gn\u012bdhra wanted a wife from a family of demigods. Therefore he went to Mandara Hill, where the women of the demigods generally come, to worship Lord Brahm\u0101. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.12) it is said, k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63anta\u1e25 karma\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 siddhi\u1e41 yajanta iha devat\u0101\u1e25: materialists who want quick results in the material world worship demigods. This is also confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. \u015ar\u012b-ai\u015bvarya-prajepsava\u1e25: those who desire beautiful wives, substantial wealth and many sons worship the demigods, but an intelligent devotee, instead of being entangled by the happiness of this material world in the form of a beautiful wife, material opulence and children, desires to be immediately transferred back home, back to Godhead. Thus he worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u."

        "translation": "As P\u016brvacitti passed by on the road in a very beautiful style and mood of her own, the pleasing ornaments on her ankles tinkled with her every step. Although Prince \u0100gn\u012bdhra was controlling his senses, practicing yoga with half-open eyes, he could see her with his lotuslike eyes, and when he heard the sweet tinkling of her bangles, he opened his eyes slightly more and could see that she was just nearby.",
        "purport": " It is said that yog\u012bs always think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within their hearts. Dhy\u0101n\u0101vasthita-tad-gatena manas\u0101 pa\u015byanti ya\u1e41 yogina\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 12.13.1). The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always observed by yog\u012bs who practice controlling the venomous senses. As recommended in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, yog\u012bs should practice samprek\u1e63ya n\u0101sik\u0101gram, keeping their eyes half open. If the eyes are closed completely, there will be a tendency to sleep. So-called yog\u012bs sometimes practice a fashionable form of yoga by closing their eyes and meditating, but we have actually seen such so-called yog\u012bs sleeping and snoring while meditating. This is not the practice of yoga. To actually practice yoga, one should keep his eyes half open and gaze at the tip of his nose. Although \u0100gn\u012bdhra, the son of Priyavrata, was practicing mystic yoga and trying to control his senses, the tinkling sound of P\u016brvacitti\u2019s ankle bells disturbed his practice. Yoga indriya-sa\u1e41yama\u1e25: actual yoga practice means controlling the senses. One must practice mystic yoga to control the senses, but the sense control of a devotee who fully engages in the service of the Lord with his purified senses (h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevanam) can never be disturbed. \u015ar\u012bla Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b therefore stated, durd\u0101ntendriya-k\u0101la-sarpa-pa\u1e6dal\u012b protkh\u0101ta-da\u1e41\u1e63\u1e6dra-yate (Caitanya-candr\u0101m\u1e5bta 5). The practice of yoga is undoubtedly good because it controls the senses, which are like venomous serpents. When one engages in devotional service, however, completely employing all the activities of the senses in the service of the Lord, the venomous quality of the senses is completely nullified. It is explained that a serpent is to be feared because of its poison fangs, but if those fangs are broken, the serpent, although it seems fearsome, is not at all dangerous. Devotees, therefore, may see hundreds and thousands of beautiful women with fascinating bodily movements and gestures but not be allured, whereas such women would make ordinary yog\u012bs fall. Even the advanced yog\u012b Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra broke his mystic practice to unite with Menak\u0101 and beget a child known as \u015aakuntal\u0101. The practice of mystic yoga, therefore, is not sufficiently strong to control the senses. Another example is Prince \u0100gn\u012bdhra, whose attention was drawn to the movements of P\u016brvacitti, the Apsar\u0101, simply because he heard the tinkling of her ankle bells. In the same way that Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra Muni was attracted by the tinkling bangles of Menak\u0101, Prince \u0100gn\u012bdhra, upon hearing the tinkling bangles of P\u016brvacitti, immediately opened his eyes to see her beautiful movements as she walked. The prince was also very handsome. As described herein, his eyes were just like the buds of lotus flowers. As he opened his lotuslike eyes, he could immediately see that the Apsar\u0101 was present by his side."

        "translation": "Like a honeybee, the Apsar\u0101 smelled the beautiful and attractive flowers. She could attract the minds and vision of both humans and demigods by her playful movements, her shyness and humility, her glances, the very pleasing sounds that poured from her mouth as she spoke, and the motion of her limbs. By all these qualities, she opened for Cupid, who bears an arrow of flowers, a path of aural reception into the minds of men. When she spoke, nectar seemed to flow from her mouth. As she breathed, the bees, mad for the taste of her breath, tried to hover about her beautiful lotuslike eyes. Disturbed by the bees, she tried to move hastily, but as she raised her feet to walk quickly, her hair, the belt on her hips, and her breasts, which were like water jugs, also moved in a way that made her extremely beautiful and attractive. Indeed, she seemed to be making a path for the entrance of Cupid, who is most powerful. Therefore the prince, completely subdued by seeing her, spoke to her as follows.",
        "purport": " How a beautiful woman\u2019s movements and gestures, her hair and the structure of her breasts, hips and other bodily features attract the minds not only of men but of demigods also is very finely described in this statement. The words divija and manuja specifically emphasize that the attraction of feminine gestures is powerful everywhere within this material world, both on this planet and in the higher planetary systems. It is said that the standard of living in the higher planetary systems is thousands and thousands of times higher than the standard of living on this planet. Therefore the beautiful bodily features of the women there are also thousands and thousands of times more attractive than the features of the women on earth. The creator has constructed women in such a way that their beautiful voices and movements and the beautiful features of their hips, their breasts, and the other parts of their bodies attract the members of the opposite sex, both on earth and on other planets, and awaken their lusty desires. When one is controlled by Cupid or the beauty of women, he becomes stunned like matter such as stone. Captivated by the material movements of women, he wants to remain in this material world. Thus one\u2019s promotion to the spiritual world is checked simply by seeing the beautiful bodily structure and movements of women. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has therefore warned all devotees to beware of the attraction of beautiful women and materialistic civilization. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu even refused to see Prat\u0101parudra Mah\u0101r\u0101ja because he was a very opulent person in the material world. Lord Caitanya said in this connection, ni\u1e63ki\u00f1canasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya: those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord because they are very serious about going back home, back to Godhead, should be very careful to avoid seeing the beautiful gestures of women and should also avoid seeing persons who are very rich. \u201cAlas, for a person who is seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord without material motives, seeing a materialist engaged in sense gratification or seeing a woman who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison willingly.\u201d (Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, Madhya 11.8) One who is serious about going back home, back to Godhead, should not contemplate the attractive features of women and the opulence of rich men. Such contemplation will check one\u2019s advancement in spiritual life. Once a devotee is fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, these attractions will not agitate his mind."

Are you one of the illusory potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? You seem to be carrying two bows without strings. What is the reason you carry these bows? Is it for some purpose of your own or for the sake of a friend? Perhaps you carry them to kill the mad animals in this forest.",
        "purport": " While undergoing severe penances in the forest, \u0100gn\u012bdhra was captivated by the movements of P\u016brvacitti, the girl sent by Lord Brahm\u0101. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25: when one becomes lusty, he loses his intelligence. Therefore \u0100gn\u012bdhra, having lost his intelligence, could not distinguish whether P\u016brvacitti was male or female. He mistook her for a muni-putra, the son of a saintly person in the forest, and addressed her as muni-varya. Because of her personal beauty, however, he could not believe her to be a boy. He therefore began studying her features. First he saw her two eyebrows, which were so expressive that he wondered whether he or she might be the m\u0101y\u0101 of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words used in this connection are bhagavat-para-devat\u0101y\u0101\u1e25. Devat\u0101\u1e25, the demigods, all belong to this material world, whereas Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is always beyond this material world and is therefore known as para-devat\u0101. The material world is certainly created by m\u0101y\u0101, but it is created under the direction of para-devat\u0101, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram), m\u0101y\u0101 is not the ultimate authority for the creation of this material world. M\u0101y\u0101 acts on behalf of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. P\u016brvacitti\u2019s eyebrows were so beautiful that \u0100gn\u012bdhra compared them to bows without strings. He therefore asked her whether they were to be used for her own purposes or for the sake of someone else. Her eyebrows were like bows meant to kill animals in the forest. This material world is like a great forest, and its inhabitants are like forest animals such as deer and tigers meant to be killed. The killers are the eyebrows of beautiful women. Captivated by the beauty of the fair sex, all the men of the world are killed by bows without strings, but cannot see how they are killed by m\u0101y\u0101. It is a fact, however, that they are being killed (bh\u016btv\u0101 bh\u016btv\u0101 pral\u012byate). By dint of his tapasya, \u0100gn\u012bdhra could understand how m\u0101y\u0101 acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word pramatt\u0101n is also significant. Pramatta refers to one who cannot control his senses. The entire material world is being exploited by people who are pramatta, or vim\u016b\u1e0dha. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore said: \u201cThey are rotting in material activities for transient material pleasure and spoiling their lives toiling all day and night simply for sense gratification, with no attachment for love of Godhead. I am simply lamenting for them and devising various plans to deliver them from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 7.9.43) Karm\u012bs who act very seriously for sense gratification are always referred to in the \u015b\u0101stras by such terms as pramatta, vimukha and vim\u016b\u1e0dha. They are killed by m\u0101y\u0101. However, one who is apramatta, a sane, sober person, a dh\u012bra, knows very well that a human being\u2019s primary duty is to render service to the Supreme Person. M\u0101y\u0101 is always ready to kill those who are pramatta with her invisible bows and arrows. \u0100gn\u012bdhra questioned P\u016brvacitti about this."

Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is offered all kinds of sacrificial ingredients, and because devotees always eat pras\u0101da, the remnants of His food, the scent of sacrificial ingredients emanates not only from Vi\u1e63\u1e47u but also from the devotees who eat the remnants of His food or the food of His devotees. \u0100gn\u012bdhra considered P\u016brvacitti an expansion of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u because of the pleasing scent of her body. Aside from that, because of her jeweled earrings, shaped like sharks, because of her scattered hair, resembling bumblebees mad after the scent of her body, and because of the white rows of her teeth, which resembled swans, \u0100gn\u012bdhra compared P\u016brvacitti\u2019s face to a beautiful lake decorated with lotus flowers, fish, swans and bumblebees."

Indeed, he was surprised to see such exceptional beauty, which must have been the result of past austerities and penances. He therefore asked the girl whether she had achieved such beauty just to break the penances and austerities of others. He thought that Lord Brahm\u0101, the creator of the universe, might have been pleased with him and might therefore have sent her to become his wife. He requested P\u016brvacitti to become his wife so that together they could perform austerities and penances in family life. In other words, a suitable wife helps her husband perform penances and austerities in household life if both of them are on the same elevated platform of spiritual understanding. Without spiritual understanding, husband and wife cannot be equally situated. Lord Brahm\u0101, the creator of the universe, is interested in good progeny. Therefore unless he is pleased, one cannot get a suitable wife. In fact, Lord Brahm\u0101 is worshiped in marriage ceremonies. In India even today, wedding invitations are still issued with a picture of Lord Brahm\u0101 on the face of the card."

Therefore, in accordance with the Vedic injunctions, the King, after his death, was promoted to the same planet as his celestial wife. That planet, which is called Pit\u1e5bloka, is where the pit\u0101s, the forefathers, live in great delight.",
        "purport": " If one always thinks of something, he certainly gets a related body after death. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u0100gn\u012bdhra was always thinking of Pit\u1e5bloka, the place where his wife had returned. Therefore after his death he achieved that same planet, probably to live with her again. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also says: \u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.\u201d (Bg. 8.6) We can naturally conclude that if we always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, we can be promoted to the planet of Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a eternally lives."
