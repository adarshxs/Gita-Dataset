For some reason, these move on the surface of the earth and are called palanquin carriers. Those material transformations which do not move are gross material objects like stones. In any case, the material body is made of earth and stone in the form of feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, torso, throat and head. Upon the shoulders is the wooden palanquin, and within the palanquin is the so-called King of Sauv\u012bra. The body of the King is simply another transformation of earth, but within that body Your Lordship is situated and falsely thinking that you are the King of the state of Sauv\u012bra.",
        "purport": " After analyzing the material bodies of the palanquin carrier and the palanquin passenger, Ja\u1e0da Bharata concludes that the real living force is the living entity. The living entity is the offshoot or offspring of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; therefore within this material world, among moving and nonmoving things, the real principle is Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Due to His presence, everything is working, and there are actions and reactions. One who understands Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as the original cause of everything is to be understood to be perfectly situated in knowledge. Although he was falsely proud of being a king, King Rah\u016bga\u1e47a was not really situated in knowledge. Therefore he was rebuking the palanquin carriers, including the self-realized br\u0101hma\u1e47a Ja\u1e0da Bharata. This is the first accusation Ja\u1e0da Bharata made against the King, who was daring to talk to a learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a from the flimsy ground of ignorance, identifying everything with matter. King Rah\u016bga\u1e47a argued that the living entity is within the body and that when the body is fatigued the living entity within must therefore be suffering. It is clearly explained in the following verses that the living entity does not suffer due to the body\u2019s fatigue. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b gives an example of a child heavily decorated with ornaments; although the child\u2019s body is very delicate, he does not feel fatigue, nor do the parents think that his ornaments should be taken away. The living entity has nothing to do with bodily pains and pleasures. These are simply mental concoctions. An intelligent man will find the original cause of everything. Material combinations and permutations may be a matter of fact in worldly dealings, but actually the living force, the soul, has nothing to do with them. Those who are materially upset take care of the body and manufacture daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (poor N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a). However, it is not a fact that the soul or Supersoul becomes poor simply because the body is poor. These are the statements of ignorant people. The soul and Supersoul are always apart from bodily pleasure and pain."

Their condition is very lamentable because you have forcibly engaged them in carrying your palanquin. This proves that you are cruel and unkind, yet due to false prestige you were thinking that you were protecting the citizens. This is ludicrous. You were such a fool that you could not have been adored as a great man in an assembly of persons advanced in knowledge.",
        "purport": " King Rah\u016bga\u1e47a was proud of being king, and he felt he had the right to control the citizens as he liked, but actually he was engaging men in carrying his palanquin without payment, and therefore he was causing them trouble without reason. Nonetheless, the King was thinking that he was the protector of the citizens. Actually the king should be the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For this reason he is called nara-devat\u0101, the Lord among human beings. However, when a king thinks that because he is the head of the state he can utilize the citizens for his sense gratification, he is in error. Such an attitude is not appreciated by learned scholars. According to the Vedic principles, the king should be advised by learned sages, br\u0101hma\u1e47as and scholars, who advise him according to the injunctions given in the dharma-\u015b\u0101stra. The duty of the king is to follow these instructions. Learned circles do not appreciate the king\u2019s utilizing public endeavor for his own benefit. His duty is to give protection to the citizens instead. The king should not become such a rogue that he exploits the citizens for his own benefit. It is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that in Kali-yuga the heads of government will be plunderers and thieves. These thieves and plunderers take the money and property of the public by force or connivance. Therefore it is said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, r\u0101janyair nirgh\u1e5b\u1e47air dasyu-dharmabhi\u1e25. As Kali-yuga advances, we can see that these characteristics are already visible. We can certainly imagine how deteriorated human civilization will be by the end of Kali-yuga. Indeed, there will no longer be a sane man capable of understanding God and our relationship with Him. In other words, human beings will be just like animals. At that time, in order to reform human society, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will come in the form of the Kalki avat\u0101ra. His business will be to kill all the atheists because ultimately the real protector is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord incarnates and sets things in order when things are mismanaged by so-called kings and heads of government. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, yad\u0101 yad\u0101 hi dharmasya gl\u0101nir bhavati bh\u0101rata. Of course this takes many years, but the principle is there. When the king or governmental head does not follow the proper principles, nature deals out the punishments in the forms of war, famine and so forth. Therefore if the governmental head is not aware of life\u2019s goal, he should not take charge of ruling the people. Actually the supreme proprietor of everything is Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. He is the maintainer of everyone. The king, the father, and the guardian are simply representatives of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, empowered by Him to look after the management and maintain things. It is therefore the duty of the head of the state to maintain the general populace in such a way that people will ultimately know the goal of life. Na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um. Unfortunately the foolish governmental head and the general populace do not know that the ultimate goal of life is to understand and approach Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Without this knowledge, everyone is in ignorance, and all society is crowded with cheaters and cheated."

All of us come into existence, remain for some time and are annihilated when the body is again mingled with the earth. We are all simply different transformations of the earth. Different bodies and capacities are simply transformations of the earth that exist in name only, for everything grows out of the earth and when everything is annihilated it again mingles with the earth. In other words, we are but dust, and we shall but be dust. Everyone can consider this point.",
        "purport": " In the Brahma-s\u016btra it is said: tad-ananyatvam \u0101rabhambha\u1e47a-\u015babd\u0101dibhya\u1e25 (2.1.14). This cosmic manifestation is a mixture of matter and spirit, but the cause is the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.20) it is said: ida\u1e41 hi vi\u015bva\u1e41 bhagav\u0101n ivetara\u1e25. The entire cosmic manifestation is but a transformation of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because of illusion, no one can appreciate that God is nondifferent from the material world. Actually He is not different, but this material world is simply a transformation of His different energies; par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate. There are also other versions of this in the Vedas: sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma. Matter and spirit are all nondifferent from the Supreme Brahman, Bhagav\u0101n. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms this statement in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.4): me bhinn\u0101 prak\u1e5btir a\u1e63\u1e6dadh\u0101. The material energy is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, but it is separated from Him. The spiritual energy is also His energy, but it is not separated from Him. When the material energy is engaged in the service of the Supreme Spirit, so-called material energy is also transformed into spiritual energy, just as an iron rod becomes fire when placed in contact with fire. When we can understand by an analytical study that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, our knowledge is perfect. Simply understanding the transformations of different energies is partial knowledge. We must come to the ultimate cause. Na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um. The knowledge of those who are not interested in knowing the original cause of all emanations is never perfect knowledge. There is nothing in the phenomenal world that is not produced by the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Aromas from the earth are different scents manufactured and used for different purposes, but the original cause is the earth, nothing else. A waterpot made of earth can be used to carry water for some time, but ultimately the pot is nothing but earth. Therefore there is no difference between the pot and its original ingredient, earth. It is simply a different transformation of the energy. Originally the cause or primary ingredient is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the varieties are only by-products. In the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad it is stated: yath\u0101 saumy ekena m\u1e5bt-pi\u1e47\u1e0dena sarva\u1e41 m\u1e5bnmaya\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 sy\u0101d v\u0101c\u0101rambha\u1e47a\u1e41 vik\u0101ro n\u0101madheya\u1e41 m\u1e5bttikety eva satyam. If one studies the earth, he naturally understands the by-products of the earth. The Vedas therefore enjoin, yasmin vij\u00f1\u0101te sarvam eva\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 bhavati (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.3): if one simply understands the original cause, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the cause of all causes, then naturally everything else is understood, although it may be presented in different varieties. By understanding the original cause of different varieties, one can understand everything. If we understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the original cause of everything, we do not need to separately study the subsidiary varieties. Therefore from the very beginning it is said: satya\u1e41 para\u1e41 dh\u012bmahi. One has to concentrate one\u2019s understanding on the Supreme Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or V\u0101sudeva. The word V\u0101sudeva indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the cause of all causes. Mat-sth\u0101ni sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni na c\u0101ha\u1e41 te\u1e63v avasthita\u1e25. This is a summary of phenomenal and noumenal philosophy. The phenomenal world depends on the noumenal existence; similarly, everything exists by virtue of the potency of the Supreme Lord, although due to our ignorance the Supreme Lord is not perceived in everything."

All the universes are resting on the brahmajyoti, and all the planets are resting on the universal atmosphere. In each and every planet there are oceans, hills, states and kingdoms, and each planet is giving shelter to so many living entities.

What is known as \u0101tm\u0101 and antary\u0101m\u012b, the Supersoul, is but an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sad-ai\u015bvaryai\u1e25 p\u016br\u1e47o ya iha bhagav\u0101n sa svayam ayam. What is described as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, complete with all six opulences, is V\u0101sudeva, and \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is nondifferent from Him. Great learned scholars and philosophers accept this after many, many births. V\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25 (Bg. 7.19). The wise man can understand that ultimately V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the cause of Brahman, and Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supersoul. Thus V\u0101sudeva is sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am, the cause of all causes. This is confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The real tattva, Absolute Truth, is Bhagav\u0101n, but due to incomplete realization of the Absolute Truth, people sometimes describe the same Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101. From the very beginning, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam says, satya\u1e41 para\u1e41 dh\u012bmahi: we meditate on the supreme truth. The supreme truth is explained here as j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 vi\u015buddha\u1e41 satyam. The Absolute Truth is devoid of material contamination and is transcendental to the material qualities. It gives all spiritual success and liberation from this material world. That Supreme Absolute Truth is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva. There is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s inner self and outward body. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is p\u016br\u1e47a, the complete whole. There is no distinction between His body and soul as there is between ours. Sometimes so-called scholars, not knowing the constitutional position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, mislead people by saying that the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within is different from the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru, so-called scholars advise the reader that it is not the person K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to whom we must surrender but the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within. So-called scholars, M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with their poor fund of knowledge. One should therefore approach an authorized person to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The spiritual master has actually seen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore he can explain Him properly. Without approaching an authorized person, one cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

Even though Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja received the body of a deer, he didn\u2019t forget his position. Consequently, in the body of a deer he was very careful to remember the cause of his downfall.
