Karma\u1e47\u0101 daiva-netre\u1e47a: we work under the influence of material nature contaminated by the three modes, and thus we get a certain type of body according to superior order. This is called karma-bandha. To get out of this karma-bandha, one must engage himself in devotional service. Then one will not be affected by the modes of material nature. \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d (Bg. 14.26) To remain immune from the material qualities, one must engage himself in devotional service \u2014 \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25.

Therefore he was always attached to Ja\u1e0da Bharata. Because Ja\u1e0da Bharata was unfit to enter the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama, he simply executed the purificatory process up to the end of the brahmacarya-\u0101\u015brama. Although Ja\u1e0da Bharata was unwilling to accept his father\u2019s instructions, the br\u0101hma\u1e47a nonetheless instructed him in how to keep clean and how to wash, thinking that the son should be taught by the father.",
        "purport": " Ja\u1e0da Bharata was Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja in the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and he outwardly conducted himself as if he were dull, deaf, dumb and blind. Actually he was quite alert within. He knew perfectly well of the results of fruitive activity and the results of devotional service. In the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata was completely absorbed in devotional service within; therefore it was not at all necessary for him to execute the regulative principles of fruitive activity. As confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhitasya dharmasya sa\u1e41siddhir hari-to\u1e63a\u1e47am (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.13). One has to satisfy Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the perfection of the regulative principles of fruitive activity. Besides that, it is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: \u201cDuties [dharma] executed by men, regardless of occupation, are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Supreme Lord.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.8) These karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da activities are required as long as one has not developed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is developed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no need to execute the prior regulative principles of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. \u015ar\u012bla M\u0101dhavendra Pur\u012b said, \u201cO regulative principles of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, please excuse me. I cannot follow all these regulative principles, for I am fully engaged in devotional service.\u201d He expressed the desire to sit somewhere beneath a tree and continue chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. Consequently he did not execute all the regulative principles. Similarly, Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura was born in a Mohammedan family. From the very beginning of his life he was never trained in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da system, but because he was always chanting the holy name of the Lord, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu accepted him as n\u0101m\u0101c\u0101rya, the authority in chanting the holy name. As Ja\u1e0da Bharata, Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was always engaged in devotional service within his mind. Since he had executed the regulative principles continuously for three lives, he was not interested in continuing to execute them, although his br\u0101hma\u1e47a father wanted him to do so."

        "purport": " Those too attached to family life, who forget that death comes in the future to take them away, become attached and unable to finish their duty as human beings. The duty of human life is to solve all the problems of life, but instead people remain attached to family affairs and duties. Although they forget death, death will not forget them. Suddenly they will be kicked off the platform of a peaceful family life. One may forget that he has to die, but death never forgets. Death comes always at the right time. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a father of Ja\u1e0da Bharata wanted to teach his son the process of brahmacarya, but he was unsuccessful due to his son\u2019s unwillingness to undergo the process of Vedic advancement. Ja\u1e0da Bharata was simply concerned with returning home, back to Godhead, by executing devotional service through \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. He did not care for the Vedic instructions of his father. When one is fully interested in the service of the Lord, he does not need to follow all the regulative principles enunciated in the Vedas. Of course, for an ordinary man, the Vedic principles are imperative. No one can avoid them. But when one has attained the perfection of devotional service, it is not very important to follow the Vedic principles. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advised Arjuna to ascend to the platform of nistraigu\u1e47ya, the transcendental position above the Vedic principles. \u201cThe Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self.\u201d (Bg. 2.45)"

He did not protest or try to convince them that he was not so. If others wanted him to do something, he acted according to their desires. Whatever food he could acquire by begging or by wages, and whatever came of its own accord \u2014 be it a small quantity, palatable, stale or tasteless \u2014 he would accept and eat. He never ate anything for sense gratification because he was already liberated from the bodily conception, which induces one to accept palatable or unpalatable food. He was full in the transcendental consciousness of devotional service, and therefore he was unaffected by the dualities arising from the bodily conception. Actually his body was as strong as a bull\u2019s, and his limbs were very muscular. He didn\u2019t care for winter or summer, wind or rain, and he never covered his body at any time. He lay on the ground, and never smeared oil on his body or took a bath. Because his body was dirty, his spiritual effulgence and knowledge were covered, just as the splendor of a valuable gem is covered by dirt. He only wore a dirty loincloth and his sacred thread, which was blackish. Understanding that he was born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family, people would call him a brahma-bandhu and other names. Being thus insulted and neglected by materialistic people, he wandered here and there.",

        "translation": "The followers and servants of the dacoit chief considered Ja\u1e0da Bharata to possess qualities quite suitable for a man-animal, and they decided that he was a perfect choice for sacrifice. Their faces bright with happiness, they bound him with ropes and brought him to the temple of the goddess K\u0101l\u012b.",
        "purport": " In some parts of India, animalistic men are still sacrificed before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b. However, such a sacrifice is only performed by \u015b\u016bdras and dacoits. Their business is to plunder the wealthy, and to become successful they offer an animalistic man before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b. It should be noted that they never sacrifice an intelligent man before the goddess. In the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja appeared deaf and dumb, yet he was the most intelligent man in the world. Nonetheless, being completely surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he remained in that condition and did not protest being brought before the deity for slaughter. As we have learned from the previous verses, he was very strong and could have very easily avoided being bound with ropes, but he did not do anything. He simply depended on the Supreme Personality of Godhead for his protection. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura describes surrender unto the Supreme Lord in this way: \u201cMy Lord, I am now surrendered unto You. I am Your eternal servant, and if You like You can kill me, or, if You like, You can protect me. In any case, I am fully surrendered unto You.\u201d"

They fed him sumptuously and then brought him before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, offering her incense, lamps, garlands, parched grain, newly grown twigs, sprouts, fruits and flowers. In this way they worshiped the deity before killing the man-animal, and they vibrated songs and prayers and played drums and bugles. Ja\u1e0da Bharata was then made to sit down before the deity.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word sva-vidhin\u0101 (according to their own ritualistic principles) is very significant. According to the Vedic \u015b\u0101stras, everything must be done according to regulative principles, but here it is stated that the thieves and rogues devised their own process for killing an animalistic man. The tamasic \u015b\u0101stras give instructions for the sacrifice of an animal like a goat or buffalo before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, but there is no mention of killing a man, however dull he may be. This process was manufactured by the dacoits themselves; therefore the word sva-vidhin\u0101 is used. Even at this time there are many sacrifices being conducted without reference to the Vedic scriptures. For instance, in Calcutta recently a slaughterhouse was being advertised as a temple of the goddess K\u0101l\u012b. Meat-eaters foolishly purchase meat from such shops, thinking it different from ordinary meat and taking it to be the pras\u0101da of Goddess K\u0101l\u012b. The sacrifice of a goat or a similar animal before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b is mentioned in \u015b\u0101stras just to keep people from eating slaughterhouse meat and becoming responsible for the killing of animals. The conditioned soul has a natural tendency toward sex and meat-eating; consequently the \u015b\u0101stras grant them some concessions. Actually the \u015b\u0101stras aim at putting an end to these abominable activities, but they impart some regulative principles so that gradually meat-eaters and sex hunters will be rectified."

        "translation": "All the rogues and thieves who had made arrangements for the worship of Goddess K\u0101l\u012b were low minded and bound to the modes of passion and ignorance. They were overpowered by the desire to become very rich; therefore they had the audacity to disobey the injunctions of the Vedas, so much so that they were prepared to kill Ja\u1e0da Bharata, a self-realized soul born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. Due to their envy, these dacoits brought him before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b for sacrifice. Such people are always addicted to envious activities, and therefore they dared to try to kill Ja\u1e0da Bharata. Ja\u1e0da Bharata was the best friend of all living entities. He was no one\u2019s enemy, and he was always absorbed in meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was born of a good br\u0101hma\u1e47a father, and killing him was forbidden, even though he might have been an enemy or aggressive person. In any case, there was no reason to kill Ja\u1e0da Bharata, and the goddess K\u0101l\u012b could not bear this. She could immediately understand that these sinful dacoits were about to kill a great devotee of the Lord. Suddenly the deity\u2019s body burst asunder, and the goddess K\u0101l\u012b personally emerged from it in a body burning with an intense and intolerable effulgence.",
        "purport": " According to the Vedic injunctions, only an aggressor can be killed. If a person comes with an intent to kill, one can immediately take action and kill in self-defense. It is also stated that one can be killed if he comes to set fire to the home or to pollute or kidnap one\u2019s wife. Lord R\u0101macandra killed the entire family of R\u0101va\u1e47a because R\u0101va\u1e47a kidnapped His wife, S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b. However, killing is not sanctioned in the \u015b\u0101stras for other purposes. The killing of animals in sacrifice to the demigods, who are expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is sanctioned for those who eat meat. This is a kind of restriction for meat-eating. In other words, the slaughter of animals is also restricted by certain rules and regulations in the Vedas. Considering these points, there was no reason to kill Ja\u1e0da Bharata, who was born in a respectable, highly exalted br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. He was a God-realized soul and a well-wisher to all living entities. The Vedas did not at all sanction the killing of Ja\u1e0da Bharata by rogues and thieves. Consequently the goddess Bhadra K\u0101l\u012b emerged from the deity to give protection to the Lord\u2019s devotee. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that due to the Brahman effulgence of such a devotee as Ja\u1e0da Bharata, the deity was fractured. Only thieves and rogues in the modes of passion and ignorance and maddened by material opulence offer a man in sacrifice before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b. This is not sanctioned by the Vedic instructions. Presently there are many hundreds and thousands of slaughterhouses throughout the world that are maintained by a puffed-up population mad for material opulence. Such activities are never supported by the Bh\u0101gavata school."

Her reddish eyes glowed, and she displayed her fearsome features. She assumed a frightening body, as if she were prepared to destroy the entire creation. Leaping violently from the altar, she immediately decapitated all the rogues and thieves with the very sword with which they had intended to kill Ja\u1e0da Bharata. She then began to drink the hot blood that flowed from the necks of the beheaded rogues and thieves, as if this blood were liquor. Indeed, she drank this intoxicant with her associates, who were witches and female demons. Becoming intoxicated with this blood, they all began to sing very loudly and dance as though prepared to annihilate the entire universe. At the same time, they began to play with the heads of the rogues and thieves, tossing them about as if they were balls.",

Goddess K\u0101l\u012b (Durg\u0101) engages in decapitating many demons, dacoits and other unwanted elements in society. Neglecting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, foolish people try to satisfy the goddess by offering her many abominable things, but ultimately when there is a little discrepancy in this worship, the goddess punishes the worshiper by taking his life. Demoniac people worship Goddess K\u0101l\u012b to obtain some material benefit, but they are not excused of the sins performed in the name of worship. To sacrifice a man or animal before the deity is specifically forbidden."

He never identifies with the body; he is firmly convinced that the spirit soul is different from the body. Consequently he fears nothing. Even though his life may be threatened, he is not at all afraid. He does not even treat an enemy like an enemy. Such are the qualifications of devotees. Devotees are always fully dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the Lord is always eager to give them all protection in all circumstances."
