Therefore real dharma means bhakti, or devotional service to the Lord. The Sudar\u015bana cakra is here addressed as dharma-setave, the protector of dharma. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a was a truly religious person, and consequently for his protection the Sudar\u015bana cakra was ready to punish even such a strict br\u0101hma\u1e47a as Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni because he had acted like a demon. There are demons even in the form of br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Therefore the Sudar\u015bana cakra does not discriminate between br\u0101hma\u1e47a demons and \u015b\u016bdra demons. Anyone against the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees is called a demon. In the \u015b\u0101stras we find many br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas who acted as demons and have been described as demons. According to the verdict of the \u015b\u0101stras, one has to be understood according to his symptoms. If one is born of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a father but his symptoms are demoniac, he is regarded as a demon. The Sudar\u015bana cakra is always concerned with annihilating the demons. Therefore he is described as adharma-\u015b\u012bl\u0101sura-dh\u016bma-ketave. Those who are not devotees are called adharma-\u015b\u012bla. The Sudar\u015bana cakra is just like an inauspicious comet for all such demons."

Similarly, illumination by knowledge also comes from Sudar\u015bana because with the illumination of Sudar\u015bana one can distinguish one thing from another, the superior from the inferior. Generally people accept a powerful yog\u012b like Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni as wonderfully superior, but if such a person is chased by the Sudar\u015bana cakra, we can see his real identity and understand how inferior he is because of his dealings with devotees."

Such is the mistaken observation of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. When Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was persecuted by the Sudar\u015bana cakra, however, his intelligence developed. Therefore the word \u0101tma-medhas\u0101 is used to indicate that by his personal experience he would understand how great a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava the King was. When Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was chased by the Sudar\u015bana cakra, he wanted to take shelter of Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, and he was even able to go to the spiritual world, meet the Personality of Godhead and talk with Him face to face, yet he was unable to be rescued from the attack of the Sudar\u015bana cakra.

Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was certainly a great yog\u012b and a very learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a, but despite his being a real yog\u012b he was unable to understand the influence of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava.

A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava can be understood by how much he is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in terms of his inconceivable activities."

Of course, this material world is full of dangers that one has to meet, but a devotee, because of his full dependence on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is never disturbed. The vivid example is Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. He was the emperor of the entire world and had many duties to perform, and in the course of these duties there were many disturbances created by persons like Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, but the King tolerated everything, patiently depending fully on the mercy of the Lord.

Thus although Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a was faced with many disturbances, the Lord, being merciful to him, managed things so nicely that in the end Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a became great friends and parted cordially on the basis of bhakti-yoga. After all, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was convinced of the power of bhakti-yoga, although he himself was a great mystic yog\u012b. Therefore, as stated by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.47): \u201cOf all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\u201d Thus it is a fact that a devotee is the topmost yog\u012b, as proved in the dealings of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a with Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni."

Because of his devotion, he thought even the topmost planet of this material world no better than the hellish planets.",
        "purport": " An exalted and pure devotee like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a is in full awareness of Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n; in other words, a devotee of V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is in full knowledge of the other features of the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features \u2014 Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n (brahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate). A devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva, knows everything (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti) because V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, includes both Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Brahman. One does not have to realize Param\u0101tm\u0101 by the yoga system, for the devotee always thinking of V\u0101sudeva is the topmost yog\u012b (yogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m). And as far as j\u00f1\u0101na is concerned, if one is a perfect devotee of V\u0101sudeva, he is the greatest mah\u0101tm\u0101 (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25). A mah\u0101tm\u0101 is one who has full knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thus Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, being a devotee of the Personality of Godhead, was in full awareness of Param\u0101tm\u0101, Brahman, m\u0101y\u0101, the material world, the spiritual world, and how things are going on everywhere. Everything was known to him. Yasmin vij\u00f1\u0101te sarvam eva\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 bhavati. Because the devotee knows V\u0101sudeva, he knows everything within the creation of V\u0101sudeva (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25). Such a devotee does not give much value to the highest standard of happiness within this material world. Because he is fixed in devotional service, a devotee does not regard any position in the material world as important. \u015ar\u012bla Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b has therefore written (Caitanya-candr\u0101m\u1e5bta 5): For one who becomes a pure devotee through devotional service to great personalities like Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, kaivalya, or merging into Brahman, appears no better than hell. As far as the heavenly planets are concerned, to a devotee they are like a phantasmagoria or will-o\u2019-the-wisp, and as far as yogic perfection is concerned, a devotee does not care a fig for such perfection, since the purpose of yogic perfection is achieved automatically by the devotee. This is all possible when one becomes a devotee of the Lord through the medium of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s instructions."

This is the position of a devotee. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, in his family life, was certainly a pure devotee, complete in every respect, because his mind and all his senses were engaged in devotional service (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayor vac\u0101\u1e41si vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-gu\u1e47\u0101nuvar\u1e47ane).
