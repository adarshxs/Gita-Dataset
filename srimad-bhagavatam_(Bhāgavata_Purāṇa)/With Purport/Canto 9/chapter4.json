He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s temples and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s places like Mathur\u0101 and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of the Lord\u2019s devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulas\u012b offered to the Lord, and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord\u2019s pras\u0101da. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a never desired anything for his own sense gratification. He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord. This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.1) the Lord recommends, mayy \u0101sakta-man\u0101\u1e25 p\u0101rtha yoga\u1e41 yu\u00f1jan mad-\u0101\u015braya\u1e25. This indicates that one must execute devotional service under the guidance of a devotee or directly under the guidance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not possible, however, to train oneself without guidance from the spiritual master. Therefore, according to the instructions of \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the first business of a devotee is to accept a bona fide spiritual master who can train him to engage his various senses in rendering transcendental service to the Lord. The Lord also says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.1), asa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e41 samagra\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 yath\u0101 j\u00f1\u0101syasi tac ch\u1e5b\u1e47u. In other words, if one wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in completeness, one must follow the prescriptions given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by following in the footsteps of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. It is said, h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate: bhakti means to engage the senses in the service of the master of the senses, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is called H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba or Acyuta.

He certainly took advice from br\u0101hma\u1e47as who were faithful devotees of the Lord, and thus he ruled the planet earth without difficulty.",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29): People are very much anxious to live in peace and prosperity in this material world, and here in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the peace formula is given personally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead: everyone should understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate proprietor of all the planets and is therefore the enjoyer of all activities, political, social, cultural, religious, economic and so on. The Lord has given perfect advice in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, as the ideal executive head, ruled the entire world as a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, taking advice from Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The \u015b\u0101stras enjoin that even though a br\u0101hma\u1e47a may be well versed in the occupational brahminical duties and may be very learned in Vedic knowledge, he cannot give advice as a guru until he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Therefore, as indicated here by the words tan-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha-vipr\u0101bhihita\u1e25, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a took advice from br\u0101hma\u1e47as who were pure devotees of the Lord, for ordinary br\u0101hma\u1e47as who are merely learned scholars or experts in performing ritualistic ceremonies are not competent to give advice. In modern times, there are legislative assemblies whose members are authorized to make laws for the welfare of the state, but according to this description of the kingdom of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, the country or the world should be ruled by a chief executive whose advisors are all devotee br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Such advisors or members of the legislative assembly should not be professional politicians, nor should they be selected by the ignorant public. Rather, they should be appointed by the king. When the king, the executive head of the state, is a devotee and he follows the instructions of devotee br\u0101hma\u1e47as in ruling the country, everyone will be peaceful and prosperous. When the king and his advisors are perfect devotees, nothing can be wrong in the state. All the citizens should become devotees of the Lord, and then their good character will automatically follow. \u201cOne who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.18.12) Citizens under the guidance of a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious king will become devotees, and then there will be no need to enact new laws every day to reform the way of life in the state. If the citizens are trained to become devotees, they will automatically become peaceful and honest, and if they are guided by a devoted king advised by devotees, the state will not be in the material world but in the spiritual world. All the states of the world should therefore follow the ideal of the rule or administration of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, as described here."

Such sacrifices were performed with great opulence and suitable paraphernalia and with contributions of dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101 to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who were supervised by great personalities like Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, Asita and Gautama, representing the king, the performer of the sacrifices.",
        "purport": " When one performs ritualistic sacrifices as prescribed in the Vedas, one needs expert br\u0101hma\u1e47as known as y\u0101j\u00f1ika-br\u0101hma\u1e47as. In Kali-yuga, however, there is a scarcity of such br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Therefore in Kali-yuga the sacrifice recommended in \u015b\u0101stra is sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a (yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25). Instead of spending money unnecessarily on performing yaj\u00f1as impossible to perform in this Age of Kali because of the scarcity of y\u0101j\u00f1ika-br\u0101hma\u1e47as, one who is intelligent performs sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. Without properly performed yaj\u00f1as to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be scarcity of rain (yaj\u00f1\u0101d bhavati parjanya\u1e25). Therefore the performance of yaj\u00f1a is essential. Without yaj\u00f1a there will be a scarcity of rain, and because of this scarcity, no food grains will be produced, and there will be famines. It is the duty of the king, therefore, to perform different types of yaj\u00f1as, such as the a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1a, to maintain the production of food grains. Ann\u0101d bhavanti bh\u016bt\u0101ni. Without food grains, both men and animals will starve. Therefore yaj\u00f1a is necessary for the state to perform because by yaj\u00f1a the people in general will be fed sumptuously. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as and y\u0101j\u00f1ika priests should be sufficiently paid for their expert service. This payment is called dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101. Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, as the head of the state, performed all these yaj\u00f1as through great personalities like Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, Gautama and Asita. Personally, however, he was engaged in devotional service, as mentioned before (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25). The king or head of state must see that things go on well under proper guidance, and he must be an ideal devotee, as exemplified by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. It is the duty of the king to see that food grains are produced even in desert countries, what to speak of elsewhere."

        "purport": " A pure devotee is uninterested not only in elevation to the higher planetary systems but even in the perfections of mystic yoga. Real perfection is devotional service. The happiness derived from merging in the impersonal Brahman and the happiness derived from the eight perfections of mystic yoga (a\u1e47im\u0101, laghim\u0101, pr\u0101pti and so on) do not give any pleasure to the devotee. As stated by \u015ar\u012bla Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b: When a devotee has achieved the position of rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord through the mercy of Lord Caitanya, he thinks the impersonal Brahman to be no better than hell, and he regards material happiness in the heavenly planets to be like a will-o\u2019-the-wisp. As far as the perfection of mystic powers is concerned, a devotee compares it to a venomous snake with no teeth. A mystic yog\u012b is especially concerned with controlling the senses, but because the senses of a devotee are engaged in the service of the Lord (h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate) there is no need for separate control of the senses. For those who are materially engaged, control of the senses is required, but a devotee\u2019s senses are all engaged in the service of the Lord, which means that they are already controlled. Para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate (Bg. 2.59). A devotee\u2019s senses are not attracted by material enjoyment. And even though the material world is full of misery, the devotee considers this material world to be also spiritual because everything is engaged in the service of the Lord. The difference between the spiritual world and material world is the mentality of service. Nirbandha\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sambandhe yukta\u1e41 vair\u0101gyam ucyate. When there is no mentality of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one\u2019s activities are material. That which is engaged in the service of the Lord is not material, and nothing thus engaged should be given up. In the construction of a high skyscraper and the construction of a temple, there may be the same enthusiasm, but the endeavors are different, for one is material and the other spiritual. Spiritual activities should not be confused with material activities and given up. Nothing connected with Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is material. A devotee who considers all this is always situated in spiritual activities, and therefore he is no longer attracted by material activities (para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate)."

In this way, one must constantly be engaged in various activities, and the hard labor involved is certainly an austerity.

A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, however, is the most intelligent personality. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a himself decided, in the presence of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, that he would drink a little water, for this would confirm that the fast was broken but would not transgress the laws for receiving a br\u0101hma\u1e47a.

This Vedic injunction declares that the drinking of water may be accepted as eating or as not eating. Sometimes in our practical experience we see that some political leader adhering to saty\u0101graha will not eat but will drink water. Considering that drinking water would not be eating, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a decided to act in this way."

Similarly, the word \u012b\u015ba-m\u0101nina\u1e25 is interpreted to mean that he was so respectful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that he did not transgress the laws for observing Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b-p\u0101ra\u1e47a, despite the thinking of Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, for he only took water.

He was fixed in understanding, and it was certain that he was simply thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the core of his heart. A devotee is never fearful of his death, for he meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead always, not for any material profit, but as his duty. The Lord, however, knows how to protect His devotee. As indicated by the words pr\u0101g di\u1e63\u1e6dam, the Lord knew everything. Therefore, before anything happened, He had already arranged for His cakra to protect Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. This protection is offered to a devotee even from the very beginning of his devotional service. Kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati (Bg. 9.31). If one simply begins devotional service, he is immediately protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi. Protection begins immediately. The Lord is so kind and merciful that He gives the devotee proper guidance and all protection, and thus the devotee very peacefully makes solid progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness without outward disturbances. A serpent may be very angry and ready to bite, but the furious snake is helpless when faced by a blazing fire in the forest. Although an enemy of a devotee may be very strong, he is compared to an angry serpent before the fire of devotional service."

Why is this? Because the devotee is any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya; in other words, he has no material desires in his heart. His only desire is to think always of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and how to serve Him best. Because of this transcendental qualification, the Supreme Lord is extremely favorable to the devotees \u2014 indeed, not only the devotees, but also the devotees of the devotees. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says, ch\u0101\u1e0diy\u0101 vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-sev\u0101 nist\u0101ra p\u0101yeche keb\u0101: without being a devotee of a devotee, one cannot be released from material entanglement. Therefore Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu identified Himself as gop\u012b-bhartu\u1e25 pada-kamalayor d\u0101sa-d\u0101s\u0101nud\u0101sa\u1e25. Thus he instructed us to become not directly servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but servants of the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Devotees like Brahm\u0101, N\u0101rada, Vy\u0101sadeva and \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b are directly servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one who becomes a servant of N\u0101rada, Vy\u0101sadeva and \u015aukadeva, like the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, is still more devoted. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore says, yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101da\u1e25: if one very sincerely serves the spiritual master, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a certainly becomes favorable to such a devotee. Following the instructions of a devotee is more valuable than following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly."

        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient, but to enjoy His transcendental bliss He requires the cooperation of His devotees. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, for example, although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full in Himself, He wants the cooperation of His devotees like the cowherd boys and the gop\u012bs to increase His transcendental bliss. Such pure devotees, who can increase the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are certainly most dear to Him. Not only does the Supreme Personality of Godhead enjoy the company of His devotees, but because He is unlimited He wants to increase His devotees unlimitedly. Thus, He descends to the material world to induce the nondevotees and rebellious living entities to return home, back to Godhead. He requests them to surrender unto Him because, unlimited as He is, He wants to increase His devotees unlimitedly. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is an attempt to increase the number of pure devotees of the Supreme Lord more and more. It is certain that a devotee who helps in this endeavor to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes indirectly a controller of the Supreme Lord. Although the Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, He does not feel transcendental bliss without His devotees. An example that may be cited in this regard is that if a very rich man does not have sons in a family he does not feel happiness. Indeed, sometimes a rich man adopts a son to complete his happiness. The science of transcendental bliss is known to the pure devotee. Therefore the pure devotee is always engaged in increasing the transcendental happiness of the Lord."

Thus He is the well-wisher of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was certainly a very great br\u0101hma\u1e47a, but because he was a nondevotee, he could not sacrifice everything in devotional service. Great mystic yog\u012bs are actually self-interested. The proof is that when Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni created a demon to kill Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, the King stayed fixed in his place, praying to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and depending solely and wholly on Him, whereas when Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was chased by the Sudar\u015bana cakra by the supreme will of the Lord, he was so perturbed that he fled all over the world and tried to take shelter in every nook and corner of the universe. At last, in fear of his life, he approached Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was so interested in his own body that he wanted to kill the body of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Therefore, he did not have very good intelligence, and how can an unintelligent person be delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The Lord certainly tries to give all protection to His devotees who have given up everything for the sake of serving Him. Another point in this verse is that attachment to d\u0101r\u0101g\u0101ra-putr\u0101pta \u2014 home, wife, children, friendship, society and love \u2014 is not the way to achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is attached to hearth and home for material pleasure cannot become a pure devotee. Sometimes a pure devotee may have a habit or attraction for wife, children and home but at the same time want to serve the Supreme Lord to the best of his ability. For such a devotee, the Lord makes a special arrangement to take away the objects of his false attachment and thus free him from attachment to wife, home, children, friends and so on. This is special mercy bestowed upon the devotee to bring him back home, back to Godhead."

Universal brotherhood is possible when one is a pure devotee (pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25 sama-dar\u015bina\u1e25). A pure devotee is actually learned because he knows his constitutional position, he knows the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he knows the relationship between the living entity and the Supreme Lord. Thus he has full spiritual knowledge and is automatically liberated (brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25). He can therefore see everyone on the spiritual platform. He can comprehend the happiness and distress of all living entities. He understands that what is happiness to him is also happiness to others and that what is distress to him is distressing for others. Therefore he is sympathetic to everyone.

        "purport": " Since Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni wanted to chastise Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, it is to be understood that he wanted to give pain to the heart of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for the Lord says, s\u0101dhavo h\u1e5bdaya\u1e41 mahyam: \u201cThe pure devotee is always within the core of My heart.\u201d The Lord\u2019s feelings are like those of a father, who feels pain when his child is in pain. Therefore, offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee are serious. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has very strongly recommended that one not commit any offense at the lotus feet of a devotee. Such offenses are compared to a mad elephant because when a mad elephant enters a garden it causes devastation. Therefore one should be extremely careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of a pure devotee. Actually Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a was not at all at fault; Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni unnecessarily wanted to chastise him on flimsy grounds. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a wanted to complete the Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b-p\u0101ra\u1e47a as part of devotional service to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he drank a little water. But although Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was a great mystic br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he did not know what is what. That is the difference between a pure devotee and a so-called learned scholar of Vedic knowledge. The devotees, being always situated in the core of the Lord\u2019s heart, surely get all instructions directly from the Lord, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.11): \u201cOut of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.\u201d The devotee does not do anything not sanctioned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is said, vai\u1e63\u1e47avera kriy\u0101 mudr\u0101 vij\u00f1eha n\u0101 bujhaya. Even the most learned or experienced person cannot understand the movements of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a pure devotee. No one, therefore, should criticize a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava knows his own business; whatever he does is precisely right because he is always guided by the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Every action taken by Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu against his son Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was taken very seriously by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus when Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was on the verge of killing Prahl\u0101da, the Lord personally appeared and killed Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu.
