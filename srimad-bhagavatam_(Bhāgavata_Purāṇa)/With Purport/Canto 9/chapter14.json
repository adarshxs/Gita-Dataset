Indeed, the inhabitants of the heavenly planets are certainly far superior to the inhabitants of earth. Nonetheless, Urva\u015b\u012b agreed to remain the consort of Pur\u016brav\u0101, although she belonged to a superior community. A woman who finds a man with superior qualities may accept such a man as her husband. Similarly, if a man finds a woman who is from an inferior family but who has good qualities, he can accept such a brilliant wife, as advised by \u015ar\u012b C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita (str\u012b-ratna\u1e41 du\u1e63kul\u0101d api).

Nor do they like to see either men or women naked, except at the time of sexual intercourse. To live naked or almost naked is uncivilized, but on this planet earth it has now become fashionable to dress half naked, and sometimes those like hippies live completely naked. Indeed, there are many clubs and societies for this purpose. Such conduct is not allowed, however, on the heavenly planets. The inhabitants of the heavenly planets, aside from being very beautiful, both in complexion and bodily features, are well-behaved and long-living, and they eat first-class food in goodness.

Desiring to go to the planet where Urva\u015b\u012b resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower ara\u1e47i as Urva\u015b\u012b, the upper one as himself, and the piece of wood between them as his son. In this way he began to ignite a fire.",
        "purport": " The Vedic fire for performing yaj\u00f1a was not ignited with ordinary matches or similar devices. Rather, the Vedic sacrificial fire was ignited by the ara\u1e47is, or two sacred pieces of wood, which produced fire by friction with a third. Such a fire is necessary for the performance of yaj\u00f1a. If successful, a yaj\u00f1a will fulfill the desire of its performer. Thus Pur\u016brav\u0101 took advantage of the process of yaj\u00f1a to fulfill his lusty desires. He thought of the lower ara\u1e47i as Urva\u015b\u012b, the upper one as himself, and the middle one as his son. A relevant Vedic mantra quoted herein by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura is \u015bam\u012b-garbh\u0101d agni\u1e41 mantha.

Thus the fire was considered the son of King Pur\u016brav\u0101.",
        "purport": " According to the Vedic process, one can get a son through semen (\u015bukra), one can get a bona fide disciple through initiation (s\u0101vitra), or one can get a son or disciple through the fire of sacrifice (yaj\u00f1a). Thus when Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Pur\u016brav\u0101 generated the fire by rubbing the ara\u1e47is, the fire became his son. Either by semen, by initiation or by yaj\u00f1a one may get a son. The Vedic mantra o\u1e41k\u0101ra, or pra\u1e47ava, consisting of the letters a-u-m, can call each of these three methods into existence. Therefore the words nirmanthan\u0101j j\u0101ta\u1e25 indicate that by the rubbing of the ara\u1e47is a son was born."

Thus he worshiped the Lord, who is beyond the perception of the senses and is the reservoir of all the demigods.",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram: any loka, or planet, to which one wants to go is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of the performance of sacrifice. The purpose of yaj\u00f1a is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, as we have explained many times, the yaj\u00f1a of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra is the only sacrifice that can satisfy the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is satisfied, one can fulfill any desire, material or spiritual. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.14) also says, yaj\u00f1\u0101d bhavati parjanya\u1e25: by offering sacrifices to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, one can have sufficient rainfall. When there is sufficient rainfall, the earth becomes fit to produce everything (sarva-k\u0101ma-dugh\u0101 mah\u012b). If one can utilize the land properly, one can get all the necessities of life from the land, including food grains, fruits, flowers and vegetables. Everything one gets for material wealth is produced from the earth, and therefore it is said, sarva-k\u0101ma-dugh\u0101 mah\u012b (Bh\u0101g. 1.10.4). Everything is possible by performing yaj\u00f1a. Therefore although Pur\u016brav\u0101 desired something material, he factually performed yaj\u00f1a to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is adhok\u1e63aja, beyond the perception of Pur\u016brav\u0101 and everyone else. Consequently, some kind of yaj\u00f1a must be performed to fulfill the desires of the living entity. Yaj\u00f1as can be performed in human society only when society is divided by var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma into four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas. Without such a regulative process, no one can perform yaj\u00f1as, and without the performance of yaj\u00f1as, no material plans can make human society happy at any time. Everyone should therefore be induced to perform yaj\u00f1as. In this Age of Kali, the yaj\u00f1a recommended is sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, the individual or collective chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. This will bring the fulfillment of all necessities for human society."

        "translation": "In the Satya-yuga, the first millennium, all the Vedic mantras were included in one mantra \u2014 pra\u1e47ava, the root of all Vedic mantras. In other words, the Atharva Veda alone was the source of all Vedic knowledge. The Supreme Personality of Godhead N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a was the only worshipable Deity; there was no recommendation for worship of the demigods. Fire was one only, and the only order of life in human society was known as ha\u1e41sa.",
        "purport": " In Satya-yuga there was only one Veda, not four. Later, before the beginning of Kali-yuga, this one Veda, the Atharva Veda (or, some say, the Yajur Veda), was divided into four \u2014 S\u0101ma, Yajur, \u1e5ag and Atharva \u2014 for the facility of human society. In Satya-yuga the only mantra was o\u1e41k\u0101ra (o\u1e41 tat sat). The same name o\u1e41k\u0101ra is manifest in the mantra Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Unless one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, one cannot utter o\u1e41k\u0101ra and get the desired result. But in Kali-yuga almost everyone is a \u015b\u016bdra, unfit for pronouncing the pra\u1e47ava, o\u1e41k\u0101ra. Therefore the \u015b\u0101stras have recommended the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. O\u1e41k\u0101ra is a mantra, or mah\u0101-mantra, and Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also a mah\u0101-mantra. The purpose of pronouncing o\u1e41k\u0101ra is to address the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva (o\u1e41 namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya). And the purpose of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra is the same. Hare: \u201cO energy of the Lord!\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u201cO Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a!\u201d Hare: \u201cO energy of the Lord!\u201d R\u0101ma: \u201cO Supreme Lord, O supreme enjoyer!\u201d The only worshipable Lord is Hari, who is the goal of the Vedas (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). By worshiping the demigods, one worships the different parts of the Lord, just as one might water the branches and twigs of a tree. But worshiping N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the all-inclusive Supreme Personality of Godhead, is like pouring water on the root of the tree, thus supplying water to the trunk, branches, twigs, leaves and so on. In Satya-yuga people knew how to fulfill the necessities of life simply by worshiping N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same purpose can be served in this Age of Kali by the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, as recommended in the Bh\u0101gavatam. K\u012brtan\u0101d eva k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47asya mukta-sa\u1e45ga\u1e25 para\u1e41 vrajet. Simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, one becomes free from the bondage of material existence and thus becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead."
