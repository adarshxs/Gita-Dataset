The v\u0101naprasthas, who have retired from family life, generally lament about their past family life because it engaged them in trying to fulfill lusty desires. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said that one should retire from family life as soon as possible, and he described family life as the darkest well (hitv\u0101tma-p\u0101ta\u1e41 g\u1e5bham andha-k\u016bpam). If one continuously or permanently concentrates on living with his family, he should be understood to be killing himself. In the Vedic civilization, therefore, it is recommended that one retire from family life at the end of his fiftieth year and go to vana, the forest. When he becomes expert or accustomed to forest life, or retired life as a v\u0101naprastha, he should accept sanny\u0101sa. Vana\u1e41 gato yad dharim \u0101\u015brayeta. Sanny\u0101sa means accepting unalloyed engagement in the service of the Lord. Vedic civilization therefore recommends four different stages of life \u2014 brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. One should be very much ashamed of remaining a householder and not promoting oneself to the two higher stages, namely v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa."

Like a he-goat, a man searches for sense gratification, wandering here and there, and a woman without the shelter of a man or husband is like a she-goat that has fallen into a well. Without being cared for by a man, a woman cannot be happy. Indeed, she is just like a she-goat that has fallen into a well and is struggling for existence. Therefore a woman must take shelter of her father, as Devay\u0101n\u012b did when under the care of \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, and then the father must give the daughter in charity to a suitable man, or a suitable man should help the woman by placing her under the care of a husband. This is shown vividly by the life of Devay\u0101n\u012b. When King Yay\u0101ti delivered Devay\u0101n\u012b from the well, she felt great relief and requested Yay\u0101ti to accept her as his wife. But when Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yay\u0101ti accepted Devay\u0101n\u012b, he became too attached and had sex life not only with her but with others, like \u015aarmi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101. Yet still he was dissatisfied. Therefore one should retire by force from such family life as Yay\u0101ti\u2019s. When one is fully convinced of the degrading nature of worldly family life, one should completely renounce this way of life, take sanny\u0101sa, and engage himself fully in the service of the Lord. Then one\u2019s life will be successful."

However, one should understand his real position and cultivate knowledge by which to get free from bodily entanglement. Like an unfortunate person who acts madly, haunted by ghosts, a materialist haunted by the ghost of lust forgets his real business so that he can enjoy so-called happiness in the bodily concept of life."

Because he used his power of mystic yoga for family affairs and not to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this exercise in the magic of yoga was no better than the affairs of he-goats and she-goats. Yogic power should properly be used to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Time deteriorates even the body itself, which is the medium for all sensual satisfaction, but even when a man becomes old and invalid, his desires are strong enough to dictate that he go here and there to satisfy the desires of his senses. Therefore, by the practice of bhakti-yoga, one should give up his lusty desires. As explained by \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya: When one is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he gets more and more happiness by discharging duties for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

        "translation": "Therefore, I shall now give up all these desires and meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Free from the dualities of mental concoction and free from false prestige, I shall wander in the forest with the animals.",
        "purport": " To go to the forest and live there with the animals, meditating upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the only means by which to give up lusty desires. Unless one gives up such desires, one\u2019s mind cannot be freed from material contamination. Therefore, if one is at all interested in being freed from the bondage of repeated birth, death, old age and disease, after a certain age one must go to the forest. Pa\u00f1c\u0101\u015bordhva\u1e41 vana\u1e41 vrajet. After fifty years of age, one should voluntarily give up family life and go to the forest. The best forest is V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where one need not live with the animals but can associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who never leaves V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Cultivating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is the best means of being liberated from material bondage, for in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana one can automatically meditate upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana has many temples, and in one or more of these temples one may see the form of the Supreme Lord as R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-Balar\u0101ma and meditate upon this form. As expressed here by the words brahma\u1e47y adhy\u0101ya, one should concentrate one\u2019s mind upon the Supreme Lord, Parabrahman. This Parabrahman is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as confirmed by Arjuna in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His abode, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, are not different. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said, \u0101r\u0101dhyo bhagav\u0101n vraje\u015ba-tanayas tad-dh\u0101ma v\u1e5bnd\u0101vanam. V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is as good as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, if one somehow or other gets the opportunity to live in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and if one is not a pretender but simply lives in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and concentrates his mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is liberated from material bondage. One\u2019s mind is not purified, however, even in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, if one is agitated by lusty desires. One should not live in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and commit offenses, for a life of offenses in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is no better than the lives of the monkeys and hogs there. Many monkeys and hogs live in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and they are concerned with their sexual desires. Men who have gone to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana but who still hanker for sex should immediately leave V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and stop their grievous offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord. There are many misguided men who live in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to satisfy their sexual desires, but they are certainly no better than the monkeys and hogs. Those who are under the control of m\u0101y\u0101, and specifically under the control of lusty desires, are called m\u0101y\u0101-m\u1e5bga. Indeed, everyone in the conditional stage of material life is a m\u0101y\u0101-m\u1e5bga. It is said, m\u0101y\u0101-m\u1e5bga\u1e41 dayitayepsitam anvadh\u0101vad: \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu took sanny\u0101sa to show His causeless mercy to the m\u0101y\u0101-m\u1e5bgas, the people of this material world, who suffer because of lusty desires. One should follow the principles of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Then one will be eligible to live in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and his life will be successful."

        "purport": " The living entity is a spiritual soul, and the material body is his encagement. This is the beginning of spiritual understanding. \u201cAs the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d (Bg. 2.13) The real mission of human life is to get free from encagement in the material body. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends to teach the conditioned soul about spiritual realization and how to become free from material bondage. Yad\u0101 yad\u0101 hi dharmasya gl\u0101nir bhavati bh\u0101rata. The words dharmasya gl\u0101ni\u1e25 mean \u201cpollution of one\u2019s existence.\u201d Our existence is now polluted, and it must be purified (sattva\u1e41 \u015buddhyet). The human life is meant for this purification, not for thinking of happiness in terms of the external body, which is the cause of material bondage. Therefore, in this verse, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yay\u0101ti advises that whatever material happiness we see and whatever is promised for enjoyment is all merely flickering and temporary. \u0100brahma-bhuvan\u0101l lok\u0101\u1e25 punar \u0101vartino\u00a0\u2019rjuna.

One should always keep this understanding in mind so as not to be allured by any kind of sense enjoyment, in this life or in the next. One who is fully aware of this truth is self-realized (sa \u0101tma-d\u1e5bk), but aside from him, everyone suffers in the cycle of birth and death (m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani). This understanding is one of true intelligence, and anything contrary to this is but a cause of unhappiness.

        "purport": " That Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yay\u0101ti was immediately liberated from the bondage of conditioned life is certainly astonishing. But the example given herewith is appropriate. A tiny baby bird, dependent fully on its father and mother even to eat, suddenly flies away from the nest when its wings have grown. Similarly, if one fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is immediately liberated from the bondage of conditioned life, as promised by the Lord Himself (aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi). As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.4.18): \u201cKir\u0101ta, H\u016b\u1e47a, \u0100ndhra, Pulinda, Pulka\u015ba, \u0100bh\u012bra, \u015aumbha, Yavana and the Khasa races and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, for He is the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.\u201d Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is so powerful that He can deliver anyone at once if He is pleased to do so. And Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can be pleased immediately if we accept His order by surrendering unto Him, as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yay\u0101ti did. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yay\u0101ti was eager to serve V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore as soon as he wanted to renounce material life, Lord V\u0101sudeva helped him. We must therefore be very sincere in surrendering ourselves unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Then we can immediately be liberated from all the bondage of conditioned life. This is clearly expressed in the next verse."

        "purport": " The word vidhuta, meaning \u201ccleansed,\u201d is very significant. Everyone in this material world is contaminated (k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go\u00a0\u2019sya). Because we are in a material condition, we are contaminated either by sattva-gu\u1e47a, by rajo-gu\u1e47a or by tamo-gu\u1e47a. Even if one becomes a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a in the mode of goodness (sattva-gu\u1e47a), he is still materially contaminated. One must come to the platform of \u015buddha-sattva, transcending the sattva-gu\u1e47a. Then one is vidhuta-trili\u1e45ga, cleansed of the contamination caused by the three modes of material nature. This is possible by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.17): \u201c\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Param\u0101tm\u0101 [Supersoul] in everyone\u2019s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who has developed the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.\u201d A person trying to be perfectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious by hearing the words of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam or Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 certainly has all the dirty things cleansed from the core of his heart. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also says, ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam: the process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord washes away the dirty things accumulated in the core of the heart. As soon as one is freed from all the dirt of material contamination, as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yay\u0101ti was, one\u2019s original position as an associate of the Lord is revealed. This is called svar\u016bpa-siddhi, or personal perfection."

        "translation": "O Lord V\u0101sudeva, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are the creator of the entire cosmic manifestation. You live as the Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart and are smaller than the smallest, yet You are greater than the greatest and are all-pervading. You appear completely silent, having nothing to do, but this is due to Your all-pervading nature and Your fullness in all opulences. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",
        "purport": " How Devay\u0101n\u012b became self-realized by the grace of her great husband, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yay\u0101ti, is described here. Describing such realization is another way of performing the bhakti process. \u201cHearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one\u2019s best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him \u2014 these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 7.5.23) \u015arava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam, hearing and chanting, are especially important. By hearing from her husband about the greatness of Lord V\u0101sudeva, Devay\u0101n\u012b certainly became convinced and surrendered herself unto the lotus feet of the Lord (o\u1e41 namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya). This is knowledge. Bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate. Surrender to V\u0101sudeva is the result of hearing about Him for many, many births. As soon as one surrenders unto V\u0101sudeva, one is liberated immediately. Because of her association with her great husband, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yay\u0101ti, Devay\u0101n\u012b became purified, adopted the means of bhakti-yoga, and thus became liberated."
