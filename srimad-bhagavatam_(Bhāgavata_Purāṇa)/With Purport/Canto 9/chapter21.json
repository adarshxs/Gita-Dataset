Nor did he distinguish between one living being and another. He perceived the presence of the Lord both in the br\u0101hma\u1e47a and in the ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la. This is the true vision of equality, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.18): \u201cThe humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].\u201d A pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, or learned person, perceives the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being. Therefore, although it has now become fashionable to give preference to the so-called daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or \u201cpoor N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a,\u201d Rantideva had no reason to give preference to any one person. The idea that because N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is present in the heart of one who is daridra, or poor, the poor man should be called daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is a wrong conception. By such logic, because the Lord is present within the hearts of the dogs and hogs, the dogs and hogs would also be N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. One should not mistakenly think that Rantideva subscribed to this view. Rather, he saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (hari-sambandhi-vastuna\u1e25). It is not that everyone is the Supreme Godhead. Such a theory, which is propounded by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy, is always misleading, and Rantideva would never have accepted it."

The Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): \u201cThis divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.\u201d If one wants to be free from the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, the illusory energy, one must become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and always keep K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a prominent within the core of his heart. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.34) the Lord advises that one always think of Him (man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru). In this way, by always being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-minded or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, one can surpass the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 (m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te). Because Rantideva was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he was not under the influence of the illusory energy. The word svapnavat is significant in this connection. Because in the material world the mind is absorbed in materialistic activities, when one is asleep many contradictory activities appear in one\u2019s dreams. When one awakens, however, these activities automatically merge into the mind. Similarly, as long as one is under the influence of the material energy he makes many plans and schemes, but when one is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious such dreamlike plans automatically disappear."
