Aside from this, the daughters of a king generally select their own husbands.",
        "purport": " In her reception of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Du\u1e63manta, \u015aakuntal\u0101 clearly said, \u201cYour Majesty may stay here, and you may accept whatever reception I can offer.\u201d Thus she indicated that she wanted Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Du\u1e63manta as her husband. As far as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Du\u1e63manta was concerned, he desired \u015aakuntal\u0101 as his wife from the very beginning, as soon as he saw her, so the agreement to unite as husband and wife was natural. To induce \u015aakuntal\u0101 to accept the marriage, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Du\u1e63manta reminded her that as the daughter of a king she could select her husband in an open assembly. In the history of \u0100ryan civilization there have been many instances in which famous princesses have selected their husbands in open competitions. For example, it was in such a competition that S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b accepted Lord R\u0101macandra as her husband and that Draupad\u012b accepted Arjuna, and there are many other instances. So marriage by agreement or by selecting one\u2019s own husband in an open competition is allowed. There are eight kinds of marriage, of which marriage by agreement is called g\u0101ndharva marriage. Generally the parents select the husband or wife for their daughter or son, but g\u0101ndharva marriage takes place by personal selection. Still, although marriage by personal selection or by agreement took place in the past, we find no such thing as divorce by disagreement. Of course, divorce by disagreement took place among low-class men, but marriage by agreement was found even in the very highest classes, especially in the royal k\u1e63atriya families. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Du\u1e63manta\u2019s acceptance of \u015aakuntal\u0101 as his wife was sanctioned by Vedic culture. How the marriage took place is described in the next verse."

According to Vedic injunctions, the father is born as the son. Therefore, maintain your own son and do not insult \u015aakuntal\u0101.",
        "purport": " According to the Vedic injunction \u0101tm\u0101 vai putra-n\u0101m\u0101si, the father becomes the son. The mother is simply like a storekeeper, because the seed of the child is placed in her womb, but it is the father who is responsible for maintaining the son. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that He is the seed-giving father of all living entities (aha\u1e41 b\u012bja-prada\u1e25 pit\u0101), and therefore He is responsible for maintaining them. This is also confirmed in the Vedas. Eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n: although God is one, He maintains all living entities with their necessities for life. The living entities in different forms are sons of the Lord, and therefore the father, the Supreme Lord, supplies them food according to their different bodies. The small ant is supplied a grain of sugar, and the elephant is supplied tons of food, but everyone is able to eat. Therefore there is no question of overpopulation. Because the father, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is fully opulent, there is no scarcity of food, and because there is no scarcity, the propaganda of overpopulation is only a myth. Actually one suffers for want of food when material nature, under the order of the father, refuses to supply him food. It is the living entity\u2019s position that determines whether food will be supplied or not. When a diseased person is forbidden to eat, this does not mean that there is a scarcity of food; rather, the diseased person requires the treatment of not being supplied with food. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.10) the Lord also says, b\u012bja\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m: \u201cI am the seed of all living entities.\u201d A particular type of seed is sown within the earth, and then a particular type of tree or plant comes out. The mother resembles the earth, and when a particular type of seed is sown by the father, a particular type of body takes birth."

According to this principle, when there is a disagreement between the father and mother, it is the father, not the mother, who is delivered by the son. But if the wife is faithful and firmly adherent to her husband, when the father is delivered the mother is also delivered. Consequently, there is no such thing as divorce in the Vedic literature. A wife is always trained to be chaste and faithful to her husband, for this helps her achieve deliverance from any abominable material condition. This verse clearly says, putro nayati naradeva yama-k\u1e63ay\u0101t: \u201cThe son saves his father from the custody of Yamar\u0101ja.\u201d It never says, putro nayati m\u0101taram: \u201cThe son saves his mother.\u201d The seed-giving father is delivered, not the storekeeper mother.

This verse says, m\u0101mateya\u1e41 purodh\u0101ya: Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata engaged the son of Mamat\u0101, Bh\u1e5bgu Muni, to take charge of performing this yaj\u00f1a. Now, however, such br\u0101hma\u1e47as are impossible to find. Therefore the \u015b\u0101stras recommend, yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25: those who are intelligent should perform the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a inaugurated by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. \u201cIn this Age of Kali, people endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.5.32) Yaj\u00f1a must be performed, for otherwise people will be entangled in sinful activities and will suffer immensely. Therefore the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has taken charge of introducing the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a all over the world. This Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement is also yaj\u00f1a, but without the difficulties involved in securing paraphernalia and qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as. This congregational chanting can be performed anywhere and everywhere. If people somehow or other assemble together and are induced to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, all the purposes of yaj\u00f1a will be fulfilled. The first purpose is that there must be sufficient rain, for without rain there cannot be any produce (ann\u0101d bhavanti bh\u016bt\u0101ni parjany\u0101d anna-sambhava\u1e25). All our necessities can be produced simply by rainfall (k\u0101ma\u1e41 vavar\u1e63a parjanya\u1e25), and the earth is the original source of all necessities (sarva-k\u0101ma-dugh\u0101 mah\u012b). In conclusion, therefore, in this Age of Kali people all over the world should refrain from the four principles of sinful life \u2014 illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling \u2014 and in a pure state of existence should perform the simple yaj\u00f1a of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. Then the earth will certainly produce all the necessities for life, and people will be happy economically, politically, socially, religiously and culturally. Everything will be in proper order."

But the child to which Mamat\u0101 gave birth was begotten by B\u1e5bhaspati irreligiously, for although Mamat\u0101 was the wife of Utathya, B\u1e5bhaspati made her pregnant by force. Therefore B\u1e5bhaspati became bhart\u0101. According to Vedic culture, a wife is considered the property of her husband, and a son born by illicit sex is called dv\u0101ja. The common word still current in Hindu society for such a son is dogl\u0101, which refers to a son not begotten by the husband of his mother. In such a situation, it is difficult to give the child a name according to proper regulative principles. Mamat\u0101, therefore, was perplexed, but the demigods gave the child the appropriate name Bharadv\u0101ja, which indicated that the child born illegitimately should be maintained by both Mamat\u0101 and B\u1e5bhaspati."
