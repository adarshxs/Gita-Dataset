In such an instance, the woman is compared to an agricultural field. A person possessing an agricultural field may employ another person to produce food grains from it, but because the grains are produced from the land, they are considered the property of the owner of the land. Similarly, a woman was sometimes allowed to be impregnated by someone other than her husband, but the sons born of her would then become her husband\u2019s sons. Such sons were called k\u1e63etra-j\u0101ta. Because Rath\u012btara had no sons, he took advantage of this method."

        "purport": " It is evident that k\u1e63atriyas killed animals in the forest because the flesh of the animals was suitable to be offered at a particular type of yaj\u00f1a. Offering oblations to the forefathers in the ceremony known as \u015br\u0101ddha is also a kind of yaj\u00f1a. In this yaj\u00f1a, flesh obtained from the forest by hunting could be offered. However, in the present age, Kali-yuga, this kind of offering is forbidden. Quoting from the Brahma-vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47a, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said: \u201cIn this Age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of sanny\u0101sa, the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man\u2019s begetting children in his brother\u2019s wife.\u201d The word pala-pait\u1e5bkam refers to an offering of flesh in oblations to forefathers. Formerly, such an offering was allowed, but in this age it is forbidden. In this age, Kali-yuga, everyone is expert in hunting animals, but most of the people are \u015b\u016bdras, not k\u1e63atriyas. According to Vedic injunctions, however, only k\u1e63atriyas are allowed to hunt, whereas \u015b\u016bdras are allowed to eat flesh after offering goats or other insignificant animals before the deity of goddess K\u0101l\u012b or similar demigods. On the whole, meat-eating is not completely forbidden; a particular class of men is allowed to eat meat according to various circumstances and injunctions. As far as eating beef is concerned, however, it is strictly prohibited to everyone. Thus in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally speaks of go-rak\u1e63yam, cow protection. Meat-eaters, according to their different positions and the directions of the \u015b\u0101stra, are allowed to eat flesh, but never the flesh of cows. Cows must be given all protection."

As will be seen, Saubhari Muni became very dissatisfied with material opulence and thus left everything and reentered the forest in the v\u0101naprastha order and achieved final success. Those who are not \u0101tma-tattva-vit, who do not know the spiritual value of life, can be satisfied with external material opulences, but those who are \u0101tma-tattva-vit are not inspired by material opulence.

The history is that when Garu\u1e0da wanted to eat fish, Saubhari Muni unnecessarily gave the fish shelter under his care. Because Garu\u1e0da\u2019s plans for eating were disappointed, Saubhari Muni certainly committed a great offense to a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Because of this vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dha, an offense at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, Saubhari Muni fell from his exalted position of mystic tapasya. One should not, therefore, impede the activities of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. This is the lesson we must learn from this incident concerning Saubhari Muni."

        "purport": " Saubhari Muni, giving conclusions derived from his practical experience, instructs us that persons interested in crossing to the other side of the material ocean must give up the association of persons interested in sex life and accumulating money. This is also advised by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: \u201cAlas, for a person seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord without material motives, seeing a materialist engaged in sense gratification and seeing a woman who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison willingly.\u201d One who desires complete freedom from material bondage can engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. He must not associate with vi\u1e63ay\u012b \u2014 materialistic persons or those interested in sex life. Every materialist is interested in sex. Thus in plain language it is advised that an exalted saintly person avoid the association of those who are materially inclined. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura also recommends that one engage in the service of the \u0101c\u0101ryas, and if one wants to live in association, he must live in the association of devotees (t\u0101\u1e45dera cara\u1e47a sevi bhakta-sane v\u0101sa). The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is creating many centers just to create devotees so that by associating with the members of such a center people will automatically become uninterested in material affairs. Although this is an ambitious proposal, this association is proving effective by the mercy of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. By gradually associating with the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, simply by taking pras\u0101da and taking part in chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, ordinary persons are being considerably elevated. Saubhari Muni regrets that he had bad association even in the deepest part of the water. Because of the bad association of the sexually engaged fish, he fell down. A secluded place is also not secure unless there is good association."

If one is free from the bondage of both the gross and subtle material bodies and remains a pure soul, he returns home, back to Godhead, to be engaged in the service of the Lord. Tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti: he goes back home, back to Godhead. Thus it appears that Saubhari Muni attained that perfect stage."

Women are not considered very powerful in following spiritual principles, but if a woman is fortunate enough to get a suitable husband who is spiritually advanced and if she always engages in his service, she also gets the same benefit as her husband. Here it is clearly said that the wives of Saubhari Muni also entered the spiritual world by the influence of their husband. They were unfit, but because they were faithful followers of their husband, they also entered the spiritual world with him. Thus a woman should be a faithful servant of her husband, and if the husband is spiritually advanced, the woman will automatically get the opportunity to enter the spiritual world."
