This indicates that no one but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is able to neutralize the reactions of sinful deeds, whether one\u2019s own or those of others. Sometimes the spiritual master, after accepting a disciple, must take charge of that disciple\u2019s past sinful activities and, being overloaded, must sometimes suffer \u2014 if not fully, then partially \u2014 for the sinful acts of the disciple. Every disciple, therefore, must be very careful not to commit sinful activities after initiation. The poor spiritual master is kind and merciful enough to accept a disciple and partially suffer for that disciple\u2019s sinful activities, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being merciful to His servant, neutralizes the reactions of sinful deeds for the servant who engages in preaching His glories.

Therefore, not only will sinful persons bathe in the Ganges water, but in Hardwar and other holy places where the Ganges flows, saintly persons and devotees will also bathe in the waters of the Ganges. Devotees and saintly persons advanced in the renounced order can deliver even the Ganges.

Because saintly devotees always keep the Lord within the core of their hearts, they can perfectly cleanse the holy places of all sinful reactions. Therefore, people in general must always respectfully honor saintly persons. It is ordered that as soon as one sees a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or even a sanny\u0101s\u012b, one should immediately offer respects to such a holy man. If one forgets to show respect in this way, one must observe a fast for that day. This is a Vedic injunction. One must be extremely careful to refrain from committing offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee or saintly person. There are methods of pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta, or atonement, but they are inadequate to cleanse one of sinful reactions. One can be cleansed of sinful reactions only by devotional service, as stated in regard to the history of Aj\u0101mila: \u201cOnly a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can uproot the weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will revive. He can do this simply by discharging devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 6.1.15) If one is under the protection of a devotee and sincerely renders service unto him, by this process of bhakti-yoga one is certainly able to counteract all sinful reactions."

The living entity is within the material world to fulfill the mission of going back home, back to Godhead. In the material world, one hankers for happiness, but because one does not know the ultimate destination, one changes bodies one after another. However, if one gets the opportunity to possess a human form of body, in this body he can fulfill the four principles of dharma, artha, k\u0101ma and mok\u1e63a, and if one is properly regulated he makes further progress, after liberation, to engage in the service of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the success of life: to stop the process of repeated birth and death and go back home, back to Godhead (m\u0101m eti), to be engaged in the service of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, taking a human body is meant for completing one\u2019s progress in life. Throughout human society, killing of a human being is taken very seriously. Hundreds and thousands of animals are killed in slaughterhouses, and no one cares about them, but the killing of even one human being is taken very seriously. Why? Because the human form of body is extremely important in executing the mission of life."

        "purport": " The example of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kha\u1e6dv\u0101\u1e45ga in performing devotional service is brilliant. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kha\u1e6dv\u0101\u1e45ga engaged himself for only a moment in devotional service to the Lord, but he was promoted back to Godhead. Therefore, if one practices devotional service from the beginning of his life, surely he will return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt (asa\u1e41\u015baya). In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the word asa\u1e41\u015baya is used to describe the devotee. There the Lord Himself gives this instruction: \u201cNow hear, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101 [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.\u201d (Bg. 7.1) The Lord also instructs: \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d (Bg. 4.9) Therefore, from the very beginning of one\u2019s life one should practice bhakti-yoga, which increases one\u2019s attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one daily sees the Deity in the temple, makes offerings by worshiping the Deity, chants the holy name of the Personality of Godhead, and preaches about the glorious activities of the Lord as much as possible, he thus becomes attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This attachment is called \u0101sakti. When one\u2019s mind is attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (mayy \u0101sakta-man\u0101\u1e25), one can fulfill the mission of life in one human birth. If one misses this opportunity, one does not know where he is going, how long he will remain in the cycle of birth and death, and when he will again achieve the human form of life and the chance to return home, back to Godhead. The most intelligent person, therefore, uses every moment of his life to render loving service to the Lord."

A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not see anything to be important but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor does he accept anything within this material world as being unconnected to the Supreme Lord. As stated in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 8.274): \u201cThe mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything mobile and immobile, but he does not exactly see their forms.

Of course, this consciousness is not for the ordinary person, but if one takes to the path of devotional service, as prescribed in The Nectar of Devotion, he can be trained in this consciousness and attain perfect understanding.

Even such an exalted devotee as Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja went to the forest for the sake of material benefit, but when he actually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he refused to accept any material benediction. He said, sv\u0101min k\u1e5bt\u0101rtho\u00a0\u2019smi vara\u1e41 na y\u0101ce: \u201cMy dear Lord, I am fully satisfied with whatever You have given me or not given me.

A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not even want to stop his cycle of birth and death.

In other words, the yogic process is a material attempt to realize the Lord, whereas bhakti, devotional service, is the spiritual process by which to realize Him. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kha\u1e6dv\u0101\u1e45ga accepted the spiritual path, and therefore he was no longer interested in anything material.
