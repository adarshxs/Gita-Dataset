Therefore although the sun-god, after appearing before P\u1e5bth\u0101, wanted to give her a child, P\u1e5bth\u0101 hesitated because she was still unmarried. To keep her virginity undisturbed, the sun-god arranged to give her a child that came from her ear, and therefore the child was known as Kar\u1e47a. The custom is that a girl should be married ak\u1e63ata-yoni, that is, with her virginity undisturbed. A girl should never bear a child before her marriage."

The material creation is certainly meant for the suffering of the conditioned souls, who are part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7): \u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\u201d All the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are as good as the Lord qualitatively, but quantitatively there is a great difference between them, for the Lord is unlimited whereas the living entities are limited. Thus the Lord possesses unlimited potency for pleasure, and the living entities have a limited pleasure potency. \u0100nandamayo\u00a0\u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t (Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra 1.1.12). Both the Lord and the living entity, being qualitatively spirit soul, have the tendency for peaceful enjoyment, but when the part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead unfortunately wants to enjoy independently, without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is put into the material world, where he begins his life as Brahm\u0101 and is gradually degraded to the status of an ant or a worm in stool. This is called mana\u1e25 \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u012bndriy\u0101\u1e47i prak\u1e5bti-sth\u0101ni kar\u1e63ati. There is a great struggle for existence because the living entity conditioned by material nature is under nature\u2019s full control (prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 karm\u0101\u1e47i sarva\u015ba\u1e25). Because of his limited knowledge, however, the living entity thinks he is enjoying in this material world.

He is actually under the full control of material nature, but still he thinks himself independent (aha\u1e45k\u0101ra-vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101tm\u0101 kart\u0101ham iti manyate). Even when he is elevated by speculative knowledge and tries to merge into the existence of Brahman, the same disease continues. \u0100ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25 patanty adha\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.2.32).

        "purport": " Materialistic men sometimes ask why God has created the material world for the suffering of the living entities. The material creation is certainly meant for the suffering of the conditioned souls, who are part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7): \u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\u201d All the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are as good as the Lord qualitatively, but quantitatively there is a great difference between them, for the Lord is unlimited whereas the living entities are limited. Thus the Lord possesses unlimited potency for pleasure, and the living entities have a limited pleasure potency. \u0100nandamayo\u00a0\u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t (Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra 1.1.12). Both the Lord and the living entity, being qualitatively spirit soul, have the tendency for peaceful enjoyment, but when the part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead unfortunately wants to enjoy independently, without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is put into the material world, where he begins his life as Brahm\u0101 and is gradually degraded to the status of an ant or a worm in stool. This is called mana\u1e25 \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u012bndriy\u0101\u1e47i prak\u1e5bti-sth\u0101ni kar\u1e63ati. There is a great struggle for existence because the living entity conditioned by material nature is under nature\u2019s full control (prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 karm\u0101\u1e47i sarva\u015ba\u1e25). Because of his limited knowledge, however, the living entity thinks he is enjoying in this material world. Mana\u1e25 \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u012bndriy\u0101\u1e47i prak\u1e5bti-sth\u0101ni kar\u1e63ati. He is actually under the full control of material nature, but still he thinks himself independent (aha\u1e45k\u0101ra-vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101tm\u0101 kart\u0101ham iti manyate). Even when he is elevated by speculative knowledge and tries to merge into the existence of Brahman, the same disease continues. \u0100ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25 patanty adha\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.2.32). Even having attained that para\u1e41 padam, having merged into the impersonal Brahman, he falls again to the material world. In this way, the conditioned soul undergoes a great struggle for existence in this material world, and therefore the Lord, out of compassion for him, appears in this world and instructs him. Thus the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.7): \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself.\u201d The real dharma is to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but the rebellious living entity, instead of surrendering to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, engages in adharma, in a struggle for existence to become like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore out of compassion K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a creates this material world to give the living entity a chance to understand his real position. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and similar Vedic literatures are presented so that the living being may understand his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25 (Bg. 15.15). All these Vedic literatures are meant to enable the human being to understand what he is, what his actual position is, and what his relationship is with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101. Every conditioned soul is struggling, but human life provides the best chance for him to understand his position. Therefore this verse says, anugrahas tan-niv\u1e5btte\u1e25, indicating that the false life of repeated birth and death must be stopped and the conditioned soul should be educated. This is the purpose of the creation. The creation does not arise whimsically, as atheistic men think. \u201cThey say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust.\u201d (Bg. 16.8) Atheistic rascals think that there is no God and that the creation has taken place by chance, just as a man and woman meet by chance and the woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a child. Actually, however, this is not the fact. The fact is that there is a purpose for this creation: to give the conditioned soul a chance to return to his original consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and then return home, back to Godhead, and be completely happy in the spiritual world. In the material world the conditioned soul is given a chance to satisfy his senses, but at the same time he is informed by Vedic knowledge that this material world is not his actual place for happiness. Janma-m\u1e5btyu-jar\u0101-vy\u0101dhi-du\u1e25kha-do\u1e63\u0101nudar\u015banam (Bg. 13.9). One must stop the repetition of birth and death. Every human being, therefore, should take advantage of this creation by understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and in this way return home, back to Godhead."

At the moment, devotees in the Western countries are being attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and becoming uninterested in materialistic activities, and therefore people are trying to oppose this movement.

That relationship is described in this verse by the words nityotsava\u1e41 na tat\u1e5bpur d\u1e5b\u015bibhi\u1e25 pibantya\u1e25.

The inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a almost every moment, but when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a left the village for the pasturing grounds, where He tended the cows and calves, the gop\u012bs were very much afflicted because they saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a walking on the sand and thought that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet, which they dared not place on their breasts because they thought their breasts not soft enough, were being pierced by broken chips of stone. By even thinking of this, the gop\u012bs were affected, and they cried at home. These gop\u012bs, who were therefore the exalted friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constantly, but because their eyelids disturbed their vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the gop\u012bs condemned the creator, Lord Brahm\u0101. Therefore the beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, especially the beauty of His face, is described here. At the end of the Ninth Canto, in the Twenty-fourth Chapter, we find a hint of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s beauty. Now we are proceeding to the Tenth Canto, which is considered K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s head. The entire \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a is the embodiment of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form, and the Tenth Canto is His face. This verse gives a hint of how beautiful His face is. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s smiling face, with His cheeks, His lips, the ornaments in His ears, His chewing of betel nuts \u2014 all this was minutely observed by the gop\u012bs, who thus enjoyed transcendental bliss, so much so that they were never fully satisfied to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s face, but instead condemned the creator of the body for making eyelids that obstructed their vision. The beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s face was therefore much more appreciated by the gop\u012bs than by His friends the cowherd boys or even by Ya\u015bod\u0101 M\u0101t\u0101, who was also interested in decorating the face of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana the Lord killed many demons, and afterwards He returned to Dv\u0101rak\u0101, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life.",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: by all the Vedas, it is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who is to be known. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, setting an example by His own behavior, performed many ritualistic ceremonies described in the Vedas and established the principles of g\u1e5bhastha life by marrying many wives and begetting many children just to show people in general how to be happy by living according to Vedic principles. The center of Vedic sacrifice is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). To advance in human life, human society must follow the Vedic principles personally demonstrated by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His householder life. The real purpose of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance, however, was to manifest how one can take part in loving affairs with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Reciprocations of loving affairs in ecstasy are possible only in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Therefore just after His appearance as the son of Vasudeva, the Lord immediately left for V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the Lord not only took part in loving affairs with His father and mother, the gop\u012bs and the cowherd boys, but also gave liberation to many demons by killing them. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.8), paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m: the Lord appears in order to protect the devotees and kill the demons. This was fully exhibited by His personal behavior. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord is understood by Arjuna to be puru\u1e63a\u1e41 \u015b\u0101\u015bvata\u1e41 divyam \u2014 the eternal, transcendental Supreme Person. Here also we find the words utp\u0101dya te\u1e63u puru\u1e63a\u1e25. Therefore it is to be concluded that the Absolute Truth is puru\u1e63a, a person. The impersonal feature is but one of the features of His personality. Ultimately, He is a person; He is not impersonal. And not only is He puru\u1e63a, a person, but He is the l\u012bl\u0101-puru\u1e63ottama, the best of all persons."
