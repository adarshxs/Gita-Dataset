        "purport": " This is an indication of the relationship between husband and wife. A great personality like Cyavana Muni has the temperament of always wanting to be in a superior position. Such a person cannot submit to anyone. Therefore, Cyavana Muni had an irritable temperament. His wife, Sukany\u0101, could understand his attitude, and under the circumstances she treated him accordingly. If any wife wants to be happy with her husband, she must try to understand her husband\u2019s temperament and please him. This is victory for a woman. Even in the dealings of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with His different queens, it has been seen that although the queens were the daughters of great kings, they placed themselves before Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as His maidservants. However great a woman may be, she must place herself before her husband in this way; that is to say, she must be ready to carry out her husband\u2019s orders and please him in all circumstances. Then her life will be successful. When the wife becomes as irritable as the husband, their life at home is sure to be disturbed or ultimately completely broken. In the modern day, the wife is never submissive, and therefore home life is broken even by slight incidents. Either the wife or the husband may take advantage of the divorce laws. According to the Vedic law, however, there is no such thing as divorce laws, and a woman must be trained to be submissive to the will of her husband. Westerners contend that this is a slave mentality for the wife, but factually it is not; it is the tactic by which a woman can conquer the heart of her husband, however irritable or cruel he may be. In this case we clearly see that although Cyavana Muni was not young but indeed old enough to be Sukany\u0101\u2019s grandfather and was also very irritable, Sukany\u0101, the beautiful young daughter of a king, submitted herself to her old husband and tried to please him in all respects. Thus she was a faithful and chaste wife."

The A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras were expert in \u0100yur-veda, as was Dhanvantari. In every department of material science, there is a perfection to be achieved, and to achieve it one must consult the Vedic literature. The highest perfection is to become a devotee of the Lord.

When he suddenly saw that his daughter had accepted someone else, even though the man was young and handsome, he immediately chastised her as asat\u012b, unchaste, because he assumed that she had accepted another man in the presence of her husband. According to Vedic culture, even if a young woman is given an old husband, she must respectfully serve him. This is chastity. It is not that because she dislikes her husband she may give him up and accept another. This is against Vedic culture. According to Vedic culture, a woman must accept the husband given to her by her parents and remain chaste and faithful to him. Therefore King \u015aary\u0101ti was surprised to see a young man by the side of Sukany\u0101."

The rules of Vedic culture in this regard are strictly observed in the respectable families of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas even today; only the \u015b\u016bdras are degraded in this matter. For a woman of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya or vai\u015bya class to accept another husband in the presence of the husband she has married, or to file for divorce or accept a boyfriend or paramour, is unacceptable in the Vedic culture. Therefore King \u015aary\u0101ti, who did not know the real facts of Cyavana Muni\u2019s transformation, was surprised to see the behavior of his daughter."
