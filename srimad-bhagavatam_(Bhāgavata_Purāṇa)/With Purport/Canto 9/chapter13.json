But devotees whose intelligence is always filled with the service of the Lord are unafraid. Indeed, they take advantage of the body to render transcendental loving service.",
        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nimi did not want to accept a material body, which would be a cause of bondage; because he was a devotee, he wanted a body by which he could render devotional service to the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura sings: \u201cMy Lord, if You want me to take birth and accept a material body again, kindly do me this favor: allow me to take birth in the home of Your servant, Your devotee. I do not mind being born there even as an insignificant creature like an insect.\u201d \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also said: \u201cO Lord of the universe, I do not desire material wealth, materialistic followers, a beautiful wife or fruitive activities described in flowery language. All I want, life after life, is unmotivated devotional service to You.\u201d (\u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka 4) By saying \u201clife after life\u201d (janmani janmani), the Lord referred not to an ordinary birth but a birth in which to remember the lotus feet of the Lord. Such a body is desirable. A devotee does not think like yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, who want to refuse a material body and become one with the impersonal Brahman effulgence. A devotee does not like this idea. On the contrary, he will accept any body, material or spiritual, for he wants to serve the Lord. This is real liberation. If one has a strong desire to serve the Lord, even if he accepts a material body, there is no cause of anxiety, since a devotee, even in a material body, is a liberated soul. This is confirmed by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: \u201cA person acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities.\u201d The desire to serve the Lord establishes one as liberated in any condition of life, whether in a spiritual body or a material body. In a spiritual body the devotee becomes a direct associate of the Lord, but even though a devotee may superficially appear to be in a material body, he is always liberated and is engaged in the same duties of service to the Lord as a devotee in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. There is no distinction. It is said, s\u0101dhur j\u012bvo v\u0101 maro v\u0101. Whether a devotee is alive or dead, his only concern is to serve the Lord. Tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti. When he gives up his body, he goes directly to become an associate of the Lord and serve Him, although he does the same thing even in a material body in the material world. For a devotee there is no pain, pleasure or material perfection. One may argue that at the time of death a devotee also suffers because of giving up his material body. But in this connection the example may be given that a cat carries a mouse in its mouth and also carries a kitten in its mouth. Both the mouse and the kitten are carried in the same mouth, but the perception of the mouse is different from that of the kitten. When a devotee gives up his body (tyaktv\u0101 deham), he is ready to go back home, back to Godhead. Thus his perception is certainly different from that of a person being taken away by Yamar\u0101ja for punishment. A person whose intelligence is always concentrated upon the service of the Lord is unafraid of accepting a material body, whereas a nondevotee, having no engagement in the service of the Lord, is very much afraid of accepting a material body or giving up his present one. Therefore, we should follow the instruction of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: mama janmani janman\u012b\u015bvare bhavat\u0101d bhaktir ahaituk\u012b tvayi. It doesn\u2019t matter whether we accept a material body or a spiritual body; our only ambition should be to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " The material body, whether in the higher or lower planetary system, is destined to die. In the lower planetary system or lower species of life one may die soon, and in the higher planets or higher species one may live for a long, long time, but death is inevitable. This fact should be understood. In the human form of life one should take the opportunity to put an end to birth, death, old age and disease by performing tapasya. This is the aim of human civilization: to stop the repetition of birth and death, which is called m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani. This can be done only when one is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or has achieved the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. Otherwise one must rot in this material world and accept a material body subject to birth, death, old age and disease. The example given here is that water is a very nice place for a fish, but the fish is never free from anxiety about death, since big fish are always eager to eat the small fish. Phalg\u016bni tatra mahat\u0101m: all living entities are eaten by bigger living entities. This is the way of material nature. \u201cThose who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands; those devoid of legs are prey for the four-legged. The weak are the subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is food for another.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.13.47) The Supreme Personality of Godhead has created the material world in such a way that one living entity is food for another. Thus there is a struggle for existence, but although we speak of survival of the fittest, no one can escape death without becoming a devotee of the Lord. Hari\u1e41 vin\u0101 naiva s\u1e5bti\u1e41 taranti: one cannot escape the cycle of birth and death without becoming a devotee. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.3). Apr\u0101pya m\u0101\u1e41 nivartante m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani. One who does not attain shelter at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must certainly wander up and down within the cycle of birth and death."

        "purport": " The demigods wanted Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nimi to come to life, but Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nimi did not want to accept another material body. Under the circumstances, the demigods, having been requested by the saintly persons, gave him the benediction that he would be able to stay in his spiritual body. There are two kinds of spiritual bodies, as generally understood by common men. The term \u201cspiritual body\u201d is sometimes taken to refer to a ghostly body. An impious man who dies after sinful activities is sometimes condemned so that he cannot possess a gross material body of five material elements, but must live in a subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego. However, as explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, devotees can give up the material body and attain a spiritual body free from all material tinges, gross and subtle (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so\u00a0\u2019rjuna). Thus the demigods gave King Nimi the benediction that he would be able to stay in a purely spiritual body, free from all gross and subtle material contamination. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be seen or unseen according to His own transcendental desire; similarly, a devotee, being j\u012bvan-mukta, can be seen or not, as he chooses. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sarvasya yoga-m\u0101y\u0101-sam\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not manifest to everyone and anyone. To the common man He is unseen. Ata\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101m\u0101di na bhaved gr\u0101hyam indriyai\u1e25: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His name, fame, qualities and paraphernalia cannot be materially understood. Unless one is advanced in spiritual life (sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau), one cannot see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore the ability to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a depends on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy. The same privilege of being seen or unseen according to one\u2019s own desire was given to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nimi. Thus he lived in his original, spiritual body as an associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " Ar\u0101jaka-bhayam. If the government is unsteady and unregulated, there is danger of fear for the people. At the present moment this danger always exists because of government by the people. Here we can see that the great sages got a son from Nimi\u2019s material body to guide the citizens properly, for such guidance is the duty of a k\u1e63atriya king. A k\u1e63atriya is one who saves the citizens from being injured. In the so-called people\u2019s government there is no trained k\u1e63atriya king; as soon as someone strong accumulates votes, he becomes the minister or president, without training from the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as expert in the \u015b\u0101stras. Indeed, we see that in some countries the government changes from party to party, and therefore the men in charge of the government are more eager to protect their position than to see that the citizens are happy. The Vedic civilization prefers monarchy. People liked the government of Lord R\u0101macandra, the government of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and the governments of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Prahl\u0101da. There are many instances of excellent government under a monarch. Gradually the democratic government is becoming unfit for the needs of the people, and therefore some parties are trying to elect a dictator. A dictatorship is the same as a monarchy, but without a trained leader. Actually people will be happy when a trained leader, whether a monarch or a dictator, takes control of the government and rules the people according to the standard regulations of the authorized scriptures."

        "purport": " This material world is called dvaita, or duality. The Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Antya 4.176) says: In the world of duality \u2014 that is to say, in the material world \u2014 so-called goodness and badness are both the same. Therefore, in this world, to distinguish between good and bad, happiness and distress, is meaningless because they are both mental concoctions (manodharma). Because everything here is miserable and troublesome, to create an artificial situation and pretend it to be full of happiness is simply illusion. The liberated person, being above the influence of the three modes of material nature, is unaffected by such dualities in all circumstances. He remains K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious by tolerating so-called happiness and distress. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14): \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\u201d Those who are liberated, being on the transcendental platform of rendering service to the Lord, do not care about so-called happiness and distress. They know that these are like changing seasons, which are perceivable by contact with the material body. Happiness and distress come and go. Therefore a pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, a learned man, is not concerned with them. As it is said, gat\u0101s\u016bn agat\u0101s\u016b\u1e41\u015b ca n\u0101nu\u015bocanti pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25. The body is dead from the very beginning because it is a lump of matter. It has no feelings of happiness and distress. Because the soul within the body is in the bodily concept of life, he suffers happiness and distress, but these come and go. It is understood herewith that the kings born in the dynasty of Mithila were all liberated persons, unaffected by the so-called happiness and distress of this world."
