Because you have heard again and again about Lord R\u0101macandra, the husband of mother S\u012bt\u0101, I shall describe these activities only in brief. Please listen.",
        "purport": " Modern R\u0101k\u1e63asas, posing as educationally advanced merely because they have doctorates, have tried to prove that Lord R\u0101macandra is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead but an ordinary person. But those who are learned and spiritually advanced will never accept such notions; they will accept the descriptions of Lord R\u0101macandra and His activities only as presented by tattva-dar\u015b\u012bs, those who know the Absolute Truth. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.34) the Supreme Personality of Godhead advises: \u201cJust try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201d Unless one is tattva-dar\u015b\u012b, in complete knowledge of the Absolute Truth, one cannot describe the activities of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore although there are many so-called R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47as, or histories of Lord R\u0101macandra\u2019s activities, some of them are not actually authoritative. Sometimes Lord R\u0101macandra\u2019s activities are described in terms of one\u2019s own imaginations, speculations or material sentiments. But the characteristics of Lord R\u0101macandra should not be handled as something imaginary. While describing the history of Lord R\u0101macandra, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b told Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, \u201cYou have already heard about the activities of Lord R\u0101macandra.\u201d Apparently, therefore, five thousand years ago there were many R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47as, or histories of Lord R\u0101macandra\u2019s activities, and there are many still. But we must select only those books written by tattva-dar\u015b\u012bs (j\u00f1\u0101ninas tattva-dar\u015bina\u1e25), not the books of so-called scholars who claim knowledge only on the basis of a doctorate. This is a warning by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. \u1e5a\u1e63ibhis tattva-dar\u015bibhi\u1e25. Although the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a composed by V\u0101lm\u012bki is a huge literature, the same activities are summarized here by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b in a few verses."

Thus the Lord achieved the hand of mother S\u012bt\u0101, who was equally as endowed with transcendental qualities of form, beauty, behavior, age and nature. Indeed, she was the goddess of fortune who constantly rests on the chest of the Lord. While returning from S\u012bt\u0101\u2019s home after gaining her at the assembly of competitors, Lord R\u0101macandra met Para\u015bur\u0101ma.

Then Lord R\u0101macandra wandered in the forest with His brother Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a as if very much distressed due to separation from His wife. Thus He showed by His personal example the condition of a person attached to women.",
        "purport": " In this verse the words str\u012b-sa\u1e45gin\u0101\u1e41 gatim iti indicate that the condition of a person attached to women was shown by the Lord Himself. According to moral instructions, g\u1e5bhe n\u0101r\u012b\u1e41 vivarjayet: when one goes on a tour, one should not bring his wife. Formerly men used to travel without conveyances, but still, as far as possible, when one leaves home one should not take his wife with him, especially if one is in such a condition as Lord R\u0101macandra when banished by the order of His father. Whether in the forest or at home, if one is attached to women this attachment is always troublesome, as shown by the Supreme Personality of Godhead by His personal example. Of course, this is the material side of str\u012b-sa\u1e45g\u012b, but the situation of Lord R\u0101macandra is spiritual, for He does not belong to the material world. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 paro\u00a0\u2019vyakt\u0101t: N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is beyond the material creation. Because He is the creator of the material world, He is not subject to the conditions of the material world. The separation of Lord R\u0101macandra from S\u012bt\u0101 is spiritually understood as vipralambha, which is an activity of the hl\u0101din\u012b potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead belonging to the \u015b\u1e5b\u1e45g\u0101ra-rasa, the mellow of conjugal love in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world the Supreme Personality of Godhead has all the dealings of love, displaying the symptoms called s\u0101ttvika, sa\u00f1c\u0101r\u012b, vil\u0101pa, m\u016brcch\u0101 and unm\u0101da. Thus when Lord R\u0101macandra was separated from S\u012bt\u0101, all these spiritual symptoms were manifested. The Lord is neither impersonal nor impotent. Rather, He is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, the eternal form of knowledge and bliss. Thus He has all the symptoms of spiritual bliss. Feeling separation from one\u2019s beloved is also an item of spiritual bliss. As explained by \u015ar\u012bla Svar\u016bpa D\u0101modara Gosv\u0101m\u012b, r\u0101dh\u0101-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pra\u1e47aya-vik\u1e5btir hl\u0101din\u012b-\u015bakti\u1e25: the dealings of love between R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are displayed as the pleasure potency of the Lord. The Lord is the original source of all pleasure, the reservoir of all pleasure. Lord R\u0101macandra, therefore, manifested the truth both spiritually and materially. Materially those who are attached to women suffer, but spiritually when there are feelings of separation between the Lord and His pleasure potency the spiritual bliss of the Lord increases. This is further explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11): One who does not know the spiritual potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead thinks of the Lord as an ordinary human being. But the Lord\u2019s mind, intelligence and senses can never be affected by material conditions. This fact is further explained in the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a, as quoted by Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya: It was actually impossible for R\u0101va\u1e47a to take away S\u012bt\u0101. The form of S\u012bt\u0101 taken by R\u0101va\u1e47a was an illusory representation of mother S\u012bt\u0101 \u2014 m\u0101y\u0101-s\u012bt\u0101. When S\u012bt\u0101 was tested in the fire, this m\u0101y\u0101-s\u012bt\u0101 was burnt, and the real S\u012bt\u0101 came out of the fire. A further understanding to be derived from this example is that a woman, however powerful she may be in the material world, must be given protection, for as soon as she is unprotected she will be exploited by R\u0101k\u1e63asas like R\u0101va\u1e47a. Here the words vaideha-r\u0101ja-duhitari indicate that before mother S\u012bt\u0101 was married to Lord R\u0101macandra she was protected by her father, Vaideha-r\u0101ja. And when she was married she was protected by her husband. Therefore the conclusion is that a woman should always be protected. According to the Vedic rule, there is no scope for a woman\u2019s being independent (asamak\u1e63am), for a woman cannot protect herself independently."

He is the son of Vi\u015brav\u0101, but is condemned like urine. Please go kill him and thus regain Your wife, S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b. O great hero, although my water presents no impediment to Your going to La\u1e45k\u0101, please construct a bridge over it to spread Your transcendental fame. Upon seeing this wonderfully uncommon deed of Your Lordship, all the great heroes and kings in the future will glorify You.",
        "purport": " It is said that a son and urine emanate from the same source \u2014 the genitals. When a son is a devotee or a great learned person, the seminal discharge for begetting a son is successful, but if the son is unqualified and brings no glory to his family, he is no better than urine. Here R\u0101va\u1e47a is compared to urine because he was a cause of disturbances to the three worlds. Thus the ocean personified wanted him killed by Lord R\u0101macandra. One feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord R\u0101macandra is omnipotence. The Lord can act without regard to material impediments or inconveniences, but to prove that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and was not merely advertised as Godhead or elected by popular vote, He constructed a wonderful bridge over the ocean. Nowadays it has become fashionable to create some artificial God who performs no uncommon activities; a little magic will bewilder a foolish person into selecting an artificial God because he does not understand how powerful God is. Lord R\u0101macandra, however, constructed a bridge over the water with stone by making the stone float. This is proof of God\u2019s uncommonly wonderful power. Why should someone be accepted as God without displaying extraordinary potency by doing something never to be done by any common man? We accept Lord R\u0101macandra as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He constructed this bridge, and we accept Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He lifted Govardhana Hill when He was only seven years old. We should not accept any rascal as God or an incarnation of God, for God displays special features in His various activities. Therefore, the Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d The activities of the Lord are not common; they are all transcendentally wonderful and not able to be performed by any other living being. The symptoms of the Lord\u2019s activities are all mentioned in the \u015b\u0101stras, and after one understands them one can accept the Lord as He is."

The R\u0101k\u1e63asas are unaware that the Supreme Lord is the ruler of the creation. They think that everything has come about by chance or accident and that there is no ruler, king or controller. Therefore the R\u0101k\u1e63asas act independently, as they like, going even so far as to kidnap the goddess of fortune. This policy of R\u0101va\u1e47a\u2019s is extremely dangerous for the materialist; indeed, it brings ruin to the materialistic civilization. Nonetheless, because atheists are R\u0101k\u1e63asas, they dare to do things that are most abominable, and thus they are punished without fail. Religion consists of the orders of the Supreme Lord, and one who carries out these orders is religious. One who fails to carry out the Lord\u2019s orders is irreligious, and he is to be punished."

What has happened?\u201d as R\u0101va\u1e47a, vomiting blood from his ten mouths, fell from his airplane, just as a pious man falls to earth from the heavenly planets when the results of his pious activities are exhausted.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.21) it is said, k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti: \u201cWhen the results of their pious activities are exhausted, those who have enjoyed in the heavenly planets fall again to earth.\u201d The fruitive activities of this material world are such that whether one acts piously or impiously one must remain within the material world according to different conditions, for neither pious nor impious actions can relieve one from m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s clutches of repeated birth and death. Somehow or other, R\u0101va\u1e47a was raised to an exalted position as the king of a great kingdom with all material opulences, but because of his sinful act of kidnapping mother S\u012bt\u0101, all the results of his pious activities were destroyed. If one offends an exalted personality, especially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one certainly becomes most abominable; bereft of the results of pious activities, one must fall down like R\u0101va\u1e47a and other demons. It is therefore advised that one transcend both pious and impious activities and remain in the pure state of freedom from all designations (sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41 tat-paratvena nirmalam). When one is fixed in devotional service, he is above the material platform. On the material platform there are higher and lower positions, but when one is above the material platform he is always fixed in a spiritual position (sa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate). R\u0101va\u1e47a or those like him may be very powerful and opulent in this material world, but theirs is not a secure position, because, after all, they are bound by the results of their karma (karma\u1e47\u0101 daiva-netre\u1e47a). We should not forget that we are completely dependent on the laws of nature. \u201cThe bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.\u201d (Bg. 3.27) One should not be proud of one\u2019s exalted position and act like R\u0101va\u1e47a, thinking oneself independent of material nature\u2019s laws."

        "purport": " Not only was mother S\u012bt\u0101 powerful, but any woman who follows in the footsteps of mother S\u012bt\u0101 can also become similarly powerful. There are many instances of this in the history of Vedic literature. Whenever we find a description of ideal chaste women, mother S\u012bt\u0101 is among them. Mandodar\u012b, the wife of R\u0101va\u1e47a, was also very chaste. Similarly, Draupad\u012b was one of five exalted chaste women. As a man must follow great personalities like Brahm\u0101 and N\u0101rada, a woman must follow the path of such ideal women as S\u012bt\u0101, Mandodar\u012b and Draupad\u012b. By staying chaste and faithful to her husband, a woman enriches herself with supernatural power. It is a moral principle that one should not be influenced by lusty desires for another\u2019s wife. M\u0101t\u1e5bvat para-d\u0101re\u1e63u: an intelligent person must look upon another\u2019s wife as being like his mother. This is a moral injunction from C\u0101\u1e47akya-\u015bloka (10). \u201cOne who considers another\u2019s wife as his mother, another\u2019s possessions as a lump of dirt and treats all other living beings as he would himself, is considered to be learned.\u201d Thus R\u0101va\u1e47a was condemned not only by Lord R\u0101macandra but even by his own wife, Mandodar\u012b. Because she was a chaste woman, she knew the power of another chaste woman, especially such a wife as mother S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b."

Mandodar\u012b, the wife of R\u0101va\u1e47a, could understand all this because she was a chaste woman. Although lamenting for the death of her husband, she knew what would happen to his body and soul, for although one cannot see directly with one\u2019s material eyes, one can see with eyes of knowledge (pa\u015byanti j\u00f1\u0101na-cak\u1e63u\u1e63a\u1e25). In Vedic history there are many instances of how one becomes godless and is condemned by the laws of nature."

He cared for the citizens exactly like a father, and the citizens, being fully engaged in their occupational duties of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama, accepted Him as their father.",
        "purport": " People are very fond of the pattern of R\u0101ma-r\u0101jya, and even today politicians sometimes form a party called R\u0101ma-r\u0101jya, but unfortunately they have no obedience to Lord R\u0101ma. It is sometimes said that people want the kingdom of God without God. Such an aspiration, however, is never to be fulfilled. Good government can exist when the relationship between the citizens and the government is like that exemplified by Lord R\u0101macandra and His citizens. Lord R\u0101macandra ruled His kingdom exactly as a father takes care of his children, and the citizens, being obliged to the good government of Lord R\u0101macandra, accepted the Lord as their father. Thus the relationship between the citizens and the government should be exactly like that between father and son. When the sons in a family are well trained, they are obedient to the father and mother, and when the father is well qualified, he takes good care of the children. As indicated here by the words sva-dharma-nirat\u0101 var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-gu\u1e47\u0101n-vit\u0101\u1e25, the people were good citizens because they accepted the institution of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama, which arranges society in the var\u1e47a divisions of br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra and the \u0101\u015brama divisions of brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. This is actual human civilization. People must be trained according to the different var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama occupational duties. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13), c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25: the four var\u1e47as must be established according to varying qualities and work. The first principle for good government is that it must institute this var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system. The purpose of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama is to enable people to become God conscious. Var\u1e47\u0101\u015bram\u0101c\u0101ravat\u0101 puru\u1e63e\u1e47a para\u1e25 pum\u0101n vi\u1e63\u1e47ur \u0101r\u0101dhyate. The entire var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama scheme is intended to enable people to become Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Vi\u1e63\u1e47ur asya devat\u0101. When people worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as the Supreme Lord, they become Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Thus people should be trained to become Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas through the system of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama, as they were during the reign of Lord R\u0101macandra, when everyone was fully trained to follow the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama principles. Simply enforcing laws and ordinances cannot make the citizens obedient and lawful. That is impossible. Throughout the entire world there are so many states, legislative assemblies and parliaments, but still the citizens are rogues and thieves. Good citizenship, therefore, cannot be enforced; the citizens must be trained. As there are schools and colleges to train students to become chemical engineers, lawyers or specialists in many other departments of knowledge, there must be schools and colleges to train students to become br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas, \u015b\u016bdras, brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, g\u1e5bhasthas, v\u0101naprasthas and sanny\u0101s\u012bs. This will provide the preliminary condition for good citizenship (var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-gu\u1e47\u0101n-vit\u0101\u1e25). Generally speaking, if the king or president is a r\u0101jar\u1e63i, the relationship between the citizens and the chief executive will be clear, and there will be no possibility of disruption in the state, because the number of thieves and rogues will decrease. In Kali-yuga, however, because the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system is neglected, people are generally thieves and rogues. In the system of democracy, such thieves and rogues naturally collect money from other thieves and rogues, and thus there is chaos in every government, and no one is happy. But here the example of good government is to be found in the reign of Lord R\u0101macandra. If people follow this example, there will be good government all over the world."

In those days, of course, people did marry more than one wife. Even Lord R\u0101macandra\u2019s father accepted more wives than one. But Lord R\u0101macandra, as an ideal king, accepted only one wife, mother S\u012bt\u0101. When mother S\u012bt\u0101 was kidnapped by R\u0101va\u1e47a and the R\u0101k\u1e63asas, Lord R\u0101macandra, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have married hundreds and thousands of S\u012bt\u0101s, but to teach us how faithful He was to His wife, He fought with R\u0101va\u1e47a and finally killed him. The Lord punished R\u0101va\u1e47a and rescued His wife to instruct men to have only one wife. Lord R\u0101macandra accepted only one wife and manifested sublime character, thus setting an example for householders. A householder should live according to the ideal of Lord R\u0101macandra, who showed how to be a perfect person. Being a householder or living with a wife and children is never condemned, provided one lives according to the regulative principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. Those who live in accordance with these principles, whether as householders, brahmac\u0101r\u012bs or v\u0101naprasthas, are all equally important."
