Thus with melted hearts they returned all the property received from Him and spoke as follows.",
        "purport": " In the previous chapter it was said that the praj\u0101s, the citizens, strictly followed the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as acted exactly like br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the k\u1e63atriyas exactly like k\u1e63atriyas, and so on. Therefore, when Lord R\u0101macandra gave everything in charity to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, being qualified, wisely considered that br\u0101hma\u1e47as are not meant to possess property to make a profit from it. The qualifications of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a are given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.42): \u201cPeacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness \u2014 these are the qualities by which the br\u0101hma\u1e47as work.\u201d The brahminical character offers no scope for possessing land and ruling citizens; these are the duties of a k\u1e63atriya. Therefore, although the br\u0101hma\u1e47as did not refuse Lord R\u0101macandra\u2019s gift, after accepting it they returned it to the King. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as were so pleased with Lord R\u0101macandra\u2019s affection toward them that their hearts melted. They saw that Lord R\u0101macandra, aside from being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was fully qualified as a k\u1e63atriya and was exemplary in character. One of the qualifications of a k\u1e63atriya is to be charitable. A k\u1e63atriya, or ruler, levies taxes upon the citizens not for his personal sense gratification but to give charity in suitable cases. D\u0101nam \u012b\u015bvara-bh\u0101va\u1e25. On one hand, k\u1e63atriyas have the propensity to rule, but on the other they are very liberal with charity. When Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira gave charity, he engaged Kar\u1e47a to take charge of distributing it. Kar\u1e47a was very famous as D\u0101t\u0101 Kar\u1e47a. The word d\u0101t\u0101 refers to one who gives charity very liberally. The kings always kept a large quantity of food grains in stock, and whenever there was any scarcity of grains, they would distribute grains in charity. A k\u1e63atriya\u2019s duty is to give charity, and a br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s duty is to accept charity, but not more than needed to maintain body and soul together. Therefore, when the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were given so much land by Lord R\u0101macandra, they returned it to Him and were not greedy."

I do not need any material benediction.\u201d Similarly, when Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was offered a benediction by Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, he also refused to accept it and instead declared that a devotee should not be like a va\u1e47ik, a mercantile man who gives something in exchange for some profit. One who becomes a devotee for some material profit is not a pure devotee. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as are always enlightened by the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the heart (sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6do matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca). And because the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are always directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are not greedy for material wealth. What is absolutely necessary they possess, but they do not want an expanded kingdom. An example of this was given by V\u0101manadeva. Acting as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, Lord V\u0101manadeva wanted only three paces of land. Aspiring to possess more and more for personal sense gratification is simply ignorance, and this ignorance is conspicuous by its absence from the heart of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava."

This was the attitude of the gop\u012bs when they thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wandering in the forest, with pebbles and grains of sand pricking His lotus feet. This tribulation in the heart of a devotee cannot be understood by karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs or yog\u012bs. The devotees, who could not tolerate even thinking of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet being pricked by a thorn, were again put into tribulation by thinking of the Lord\u2019s disappearance, for the Lord had to return to His abode after finishing His pastimes in this material world. The word \u0101tma-jyoti\u1e25 is significant. The brahmajyoti, which is greatly appreciated by j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, or monistic philosophers who desire to enter it for liberation, is nothing but the rays of the Lord\u2019s body. \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes.\u201d (Brahma-samhit\u0101 5.40) The brahmajyoti is the beginning of the spiritual world, and beyond the brahmajyoti are the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. In other words, the brahmajyoti stays outside the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, just as the sunshine stays outside the sun. To enter the sun planet, one must go through the sunshine. Similarly, when the Lord or His devotees enter the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, they go through the brahmajyoti. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, or monistic philosophers, because of their impersonal conception of the Lord, cannot enter the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, but they also cannot stay eternally in the brahmajyoti. Thus after some time they fall again to this material world. \u0100ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25 patanty adho\u00a0\u2019n\u0101d\u1e5bta-yu\u1e63mad-a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.2.32). The Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are covered by the brahmajyoti, and therefore one cannot properly understand what those Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are unless one is a pure devotee."

There is actually no question of anyone\u2019s being His enemy, but when the Lord wants to take pleasure in pastimes, He comes down to this material world and acts like a human being, thus showing His wonderful, glorious activities to please the devotees. His devotees always want to see the Lord victorious in varied activities, and therefore, to please Himself and them, the Lord sometimes agrees to act as a human being and perform wonderful, uncommon pastimes for the satisfaction of the devotees."

All the inhabitants of Ayodhy\u0101 who saw Lord R\u0101macandra as citizens, served Him as servants, sat and talked with Him as friends or were somehow or other present during His reign went back home, back to Godhead.

        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not allow any of His devotees or assistants to be engaged in sense gratification. The younger brothers of Lord R\u0101macandra were at home enjoying the personal presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Lord ordered Them to go out and achieve victory all over the world. It was the custom (and this custom, in some places, is still current) that all other kings would have to accept the supremacy of the emperor. If the king of a small state did not accept the emperor\u2019s supremacy, there would be a fight, and the king of the small state would be obliged to accept the emperor as supreme; otherwise, it would not be possible for the emperor to rule the country. Lord R\u0101macandra showed His favor to His brothers by ordering Them to go out. Many of the Lord\u2019s devotees residing in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana have taken the vow not to leave V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. But the Lord says that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be spread all over the world, in every village and every town. This is the open order of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. A pure devotee, therefore, must execute the order of the Lord and must not gratify his senses by remaining stagnant in one place, falsely proud, thinking that because he does not leave V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana but chants in a solitary place he has become a great devotee. A devotee must carry out the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said, y\u0101re dekha, t\u0101re kaha\u00a0\u2018k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019-upade\u015ba. Every devotee, therefore, should spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by preaching, asking whomever he meets to accept the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says, sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.\u201d This is the order of the Lord, who speaks as the supreme emperor. Everyone should be induced to accept this order, for this is victory (dig-vijaya). And it is the duty of the soldier, the devotee, to impress upon everyone this philosophy of life. Of course, those who are kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012bs do not preach, but the Lord shows mercy to them also, as He did by staying personally in Ayodhy\u0101 to give audience to the people in general. One should not mistakenly think that the Lord asked His younger brothers to leave Ayodhy\u0101 because He especially favored the citizens. The Lord is merciful to everyone, and He knows how to show His favor to each individual person according to his capacity. One who abides by the order of the Lord is a pure devotee."

        "purport": " We have simply heard about the opulence of R\u0101ma-r\u0101jya during the reign of Lord R\u0101macandra. Now, here is one example of the opulence of the Lord\u2019s kingdom. The streets of Ayodhy\u0101 were not only cleaned but also sprinkled with perfumed water and drops of perfumed liquor, which were distributed by elephants through their trunks. There was no need of sprinkling machines, for the elephant has a natural ability to suck water through its trunk and again throw it out in a shower. We can understand the opulence of the city from this one example: it was actually sprinkled with perfumed water. Moreover, the citizens had the opportunity to see the Lord personally supervising the affairs of the state. He was not a sleeping monarch, as we can understand from His activities in sending His brothers to see to affairs outside the capital and punish anyone who did not obey the emperor\u2019s orders. This is called dig-vijaya. The citizens were all given facilities for peaceful life, and they were also qualified with appropriate attributes according to var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama. As we have seen from the previous chapter, var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-gu\u1e47\u0101nvit\u0101\u1e25: the citizens were trained according to the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system. A class of men were br\u0101hma\u1e47as, a class of men were k\u1e63atriyas, a class were vai\u015byas, and a class were \u015b\u016bdras. Without this scientific division, there can be no question of good citizenship. The King, being magnanimous and perfect in His duty, performed many sacrifices and treated the citizens as His sons, and the citizens, being trained in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, were obedient and perfectly ordered. The entire monarchy was so opulent and peaceful that the government was even able to sprinkle the street with perfumed water, what to speak of other management. Since the city was sprinkled with perfumed water, we can simply imagine how opulent it was in other respects. Why should the citizens not have felt happy during the reign of Lord R\u0101macandra?"
