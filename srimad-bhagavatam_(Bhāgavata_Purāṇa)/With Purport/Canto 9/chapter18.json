        "purport": " Self-realization is the prime objective of human civilization, and it is regarded seriously by those who are situated in the mode of goodness and have developed the brahminical qualities. K\u1e63atriyas are generally endowed with material qualities conducive to gaining material wealth and enjoying sense gratification, but those who are spiritually advanced are not interested in material opulence. Indeed, they accept only the bare necessities for a life of spiritual advancement in self-realization. It is specifically mentioned here that if one enters political life, especially in the modern day, one loses the chance for human perfection. Nonetheless, one can attain the highest perfection if one hears \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. This hearing is described as nitya\u1e41 bh\u0101gavata-sevay\u0101. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was involved in politics, but because at the end of his life he heard \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, he attained perfection very easily. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has therefore suggested: Regardless of whether one is in the mode of passion, ignorance or goodness, if one regularly hears \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from the self-realized soul, one is freed from the bondage of material involvement."

        "purport": " Kaca, the son of the learned celestial priest B\u1e5bhaspati, had been a student of \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, from whom he had learned the art of reviving a man who has died untimely. This art, called m\u1e5bta-sa\u00f1j\u012bvan\u012b, was especially used during wartime. When there was a war, soldiers would certainly die untimely, but if a soldier\u2019s body was intact, he could be brought to life again by this art of m\u1e5bta-sa\u00f1j\u012bvan\u012b. This art was known to \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya and many others, and Kaca, the son of B\u1e5bhaspati, became \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s student to learn it. Devay\u0101n\u012b desired to have Kaca as her husband, but Kaca, out of regard for \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, looked upon the guru\u2019s daughter as a respectable superior and therefore refused to marry her. Devay\u0101n\u012b angrily cursed Kaca by saying that although he had learned the art of m\u1e5bta-sa\u00f1j\u012bvan\u012b from her father, it would be useless. When cursed in this way, Kaca retaliated by cursing Devay\u0101n\u012b never to have a husband who was a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Because Devay\u0101n\u012b liked Yay\u0101ti, who was a k\u1e63atriya, she requested him to accept her as his bona fide wife. Although this would be pratiloma-viv\u0101ha, a marriage between the daughter of a high family and the son of a lower family, she explained that this arrangement was made by providence."

        "purport": " According to the Vedic system, the parents would consider the horoscopes of the boy and girl who were to be married. If according to astrological calculations the boy and girl were compatible in every respect, the match was called yo\u1e6daka and the marriage would be accepted. Even fifty years ago, this system was current in Hindu society. Regardless of the affluence of the boy or the personal beauty of the girl, without this astrological compatibility the marriage would not take place. A person is born in one of three categories, known as deva-ga\u1e47a, manu\u1e63ya-ga\u1e47a and rak\u1e63asa-ga\u1e47a. In different parts of the universe there are demigods and demons, and in human society also some people resemble demigods whereas others resemble demons. If according to astrological calculations there was conflict between a godly and a demoniac nature, the marriage would not take place. Similarly, there were calculations of pratiloma and anuloma. The central idea is that if the boy and girl were on an equal level the marriage would be happy, whereas inequality would lead to unhappiness. Because care is no longer taken in marriage, we now find many divorces. Indeed, divorce has now become a common affair, although formerly one\u2019s marriage would continue lifelong, and the affection between husband and wife was so great that the wife would voluntarily die when her husband died or would remain a faithful widow throughout her entire life. Now, of course, this is no longer possible, for human society has fallen to the level of animal society. Marriage now takes place simply by agreement. D\u0101mpatye\u00a0\u2019bhirucir hetu\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 12.2.3). The word abhiruci means \u201cagreement.\u201d If the boy and girl simply agree to marry, the marriage takes place. But when the Vedic system is not rigidly observed, marriage frequently ends in divorce."

Now these friends became maidservants of Devay\u0101n\u012b. When a girl married a k\u1e63atriya king, it was customary for all her girlfriends to go with her to her husband\u2019s house. For instance, when Vasudeva married Devak\u012b, the mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he married all six of her sisters, and she also had many friends who accompanied her. A king would maintain not only his wife but also the many friends and maidservants of his wife. Some of these maidservants would become pregnant and give birth to children. Such children were accepted as d\u0101s\u012b-putra, the sons of the maidservants, and the king would maintain them. The female population is always greater than the male, but since a woman needs to be protected by a man, the king would maintain many girls, who acted either as friends or as maidservants of the queen. In the history of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s household life we find that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a married 16,108 wives. These were not maidservants but direct queens, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expanded Himself into 16,108 forms to maintain different establishments for each and every wife. This is not possible for ordinary men. Therefore although the kings had to maintain many, many servants and wives, not all of them had different establishments."

        "purport": " This is the nature of lusty desires. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20) it is said, k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25: when one is too attached to sense gratification, he actually loses his sense. The word h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 refers to one who has lost his sense. Here is an example: the father shamelessly asked his son to exchange youth for old age. Of course, the entire world is under such illusion. Therefore it is said that everyone is pramatta\u1e25, or exclusively mad. N\u016bna\u1e41 pramatta\u1e25 kurute vikarma: when one becomes almost like a madman, he indulges in sex and sense gratification. Sex and sense gratification can be controlled, however, and one achieves perfection when he has no desires for sex. This is possible only when one is fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. \u201cSince I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste.\u201d Sexual desire can be stopped only when one is fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, and not otherwise. As long as one has desires for sex, one must change his body and transmigrate from one body to another to enjoy sex in different species or forms. But although the forms may differ, the business of sex is the same. Therefore it is said, puna\u1e25 puna\u015b carvita-carva\u1e47\u0101n\u0101m. Those who are very much attached to sex transmigrate from one body to another, with the same business of \u201cchewing the chewed,\u201d tasting sex enjoyment as a dog, sex enjoyment as a hog, sex enjoyment as a demigod, and so on."

        "translation": "Yadu replied: My dear father, you have already achieved old age, although you also were a young man. But I do not welcome your old age and invalidity, for unless one enjoys material happiness, one cannot attain renunciation.",
        "purport": " Renunciation of material enjoyment is the ultimate goal of human life. Therefore the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution is most scientific. It aims at giving one the facility to return home, back to Godhead, which one cannot do without completely renouncing all connections with the material world. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said, ni\u1e63ki\u00f1canasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya: one who wants to go back home, back to Godhead, must be ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana, free from all affinity for material enjoyment. Brahma\u1e47y upa\u015bam\u0101\u015brayam: unless one is fully renounced, one cannot engage in devotional service or stay in Brahman. Devotional service is rendered on the Brahman platform. Therefore, unless one attains the Brahman platform, or spiritual platform, one cannot engage in devotional service; or, in other words, a person engaged in devotional service is already on the Brahman platform. \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d (Bg. 14.26) If one attains devotional service, therefore, he is certainly liberated. Generally, unless one enjoys material happiness, one cannot attain renunciation. Var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama therefore gives the opportunity for gradual elevation. Yadu, the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yay\u0101ti, explained that he was unable to give up his youth, for he wanted to use it to attain the renounced order in the future. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yadu was different from his brothers. As stated in the next verse, turvasu\u015b codita\u1e25 pitr\u0101 druhyu\u015b c\u0101nu\u015b ca bh\u0101rata/ praty\u0101cakhyur adharmaj\u00f1\u0101\u1e25. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yadu\u2019s brothers refused to accept their father\u2019s proposal because they were not completely aware of dharma. To accept orders that follow religious principles, especially the orders of one\u2019s father, is very important. Therefore when the brothers of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yadu refused their father\u2019s order, this was certainly irreligious. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yadu\u2019s refusal, however, was religious. As stated in the Tenth Canto, yado\u015b ca dharma-\u015b\u012blasya: Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yadu was completely aware of the principles of religion. The ultimate principle of religion is to engage oneself in devotional service to the Lord. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yadu was very eager to engage himself in the Lord\u2019s service, but there was an impediment: during youth the material desire to enjoy the material senses is certainly present, and unless one fully satisfies these lusty desires in youth, there is a chance of one\u2019s being disturbed in rendering service to the Lord. We have actually seen that many sanny\u0101s\u012bs who accept sanny\u0101sa prematurely, not having satisfied their material desires, fall down because they are disturbed. Therefore the general process is to go through g\u1e5bhastha life and v\u0101naprastha life and finally come to sanny\u0101sa and devote oneself completely to the service of the Lord. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yadu was ready to accept his father\u2019s order and exchange youth for old age because he was confident that the youth taken by his father would be returned. But because this exchange would delay his complete engagement in devotional service, he did not want to accept his father\u2019s old age, for he was eager to achieve freedom from disturbances. Moreover, among the descendants of Yadu would be Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, because Yadu was eager to see the Lord\u2019s appearance in his dynasty as soon as possible, Yadu refused to accept his father\u2019s proposal. This was not irreligious, however, because Yadu\u2019s purpose was to serve the Lord. Because Yadu was a faithful servant of the Lord, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared in his dynasty. As confirmed in the prayers of Kunt\u012b, yado\u1e25 priyasy\u0101nvav\u0101ye. Yadu was very dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was therefore eager to descend in Yadu\u2019s dynasty. In conclusion, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yadu should not be considered adharma-j\u00f1a, ignorant of religious principles, as the next verse designates his brothers. He was like the four Sanakas (catu\u1e25-sana), who refused the order of their father, Brahm\u0101, for the sake of a better cause. Because the four Kum\u0101ras wanted to engage themselves completely in the service of the Lord as brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, their refusal to obey their father\u2019s order was not irreligious."
