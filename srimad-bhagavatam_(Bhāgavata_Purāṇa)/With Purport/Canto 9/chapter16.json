That the k\u1e63atriyas had killed his father was only a plea; the real fact is that because the k\u1e63atriyas, the ruling class, had become polluted, their position was inauspicious. Brahminical culture is enjoined in the \u015b\u0101stra, especially in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25).

Whenever the government disrespects the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead and fails to protect the institution of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, it will certainly have to face such catastrophes as formerly brought about by Lord Para\u015bur\u0101ma."

The whole problem of life is this repetition of birth and death. Therefore one is advised to work to perform yaj\u00f1a meant for satisfying Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Although Lord Para\u015bur\u0101ma was an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he had to account for sinful activities. Anyone in this material world, however careful he may be, must commit some sinful activities, even though he does not want to. For example, one may trample many small ants and other insects while walking on the street and kill many living beings unknowingly. Therefore the Vedic principle of pa\u00f1ca-yaj\u00f1a, five kinds of recommended sacrifice, is compulsory. In this Age of Kali, however, there is a great concession given to people in general. Yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25: we may worship Lord Caitanya, the hidden incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

One is recommended to worship this incarnation by chanting, the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. The performance of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a is a special concession for human society to save people from being affected by known or unknown sinful activities. We are surrounded by unlimited sins, and therefore it is compulsory that one take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra."

        "purport": " Now, having narrated the history of Lord Para\u015bur\u0101ma, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b begins the history of Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra. From the history of Para\u015bur\u0101ma we can understand that although Para\u015bur\u0101ma belonged to the brahminical group, he circumstantially had to work as a k\u1e63atriya. Later, after finishing his work as a k\u1e63atriya, he again became a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and returned to Mahendra-parvata. Similarly, we can see that although Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was born in a k\u1e63atriya family, by austerities and penances he achieved the position of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. These histories confirm the statements in \u015b\u0101stra that a br\u0101hma\u1e47a may become a k\u1e63atriya, a k\u1e63atriya may become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or vai\u015bya, and a vai\u015bya may become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, by achieving the required qualities. One\u2019s status does not depend upon birth. As confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (7.11.35) by N\u0101rada: \u201cIf one shows the symptoms of being a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra, even if he has appeared in a different class, he should be accepted according to those symptoms of classification.\u201d To know who is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and who is a k\u1e63atriya, one must consider a man\u2019s quality and work. If all the unqualified \u015b\u016bdras become so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas, social order will be impossible to maintain. Thus there will be discrepancies, human society will turn into a society of animals, and the situation all over the world will be hellish."
