        "translation": "When the royal dynasty, being excessively proud because of the material modes of passion and ignorance, became irreligious and ceased to care for the laws enacted by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, Para\u015bur\u0101ma killed them. Although their offense was not very severe, he killed them to lessen the burden of the world.",
        "purport": " The k\u1e63atriyas, or the ruling class, must govern the world in accordance with the rules and regulations enacted by great br\u0101hma\u1e47as and saintly persons. As soon as the ruling class becomes irresponsible in regard to the religious principles, it becomes a burden on the earth. As stated here, rajas-tamo-v\u1e5bta\u1e41, bh\u0101ram abrahma\u1e47yam: when the ruling class is influenced by the lower modes of nature, namely ignorance and passion, it becomes a burden to the world and must then be annihilated by superior power. We actually see from modern history that monarchies have been abolished by various revolutions, but unfortunately the monarchies have been abolished to establish the supremacy of third-class and fourth-class men. Although monarchies overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance have been abolished in the world, the inhabitants of the world are still unhappy, for although the qualities of the former monarchs were degraded by taints of ignorance, these monarchs have been replaced by men of the mercantile and worker classes whose qualities are even more degraded. When the government is actually guided by br\u0101hma\u1e47as, or God conscious men, then there can be real happiness for the people. Therefore in previous times, when the ruling class was degraded to the modes of passion and ignorance, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, headed by such a k\u1e63atriya-spirited br\u0101hma\u1e47a as Para\u015bur\u0101ma, killed them twenty-one consecutive times. In Kali-yuga, as stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.2.13), dasyu-pr\u0101ye\u1e63u r\u0101jasu: the ruling class (r\u0101janya) will be no better than plunderers (dasyus) because the third-class and fourth-class men will monopolize the affairs of the government. Ignoring the religious principles and brahminical rules and regulations, they will certainly try to plunder the riches of the citizens without consideration. As stated elsewhere in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.1.40): Being unpurified, neglecting to discharge human duties properly, and being influenced by the modes of passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas), unclean people (mlecchas), posing as members of the government (r\u0101janya-r\u016bpi\u1e47a\u1e25), will swallow the citizens (pr\u0101jas te bhak\u1e63ayi\u1e63yanti). And in still another place, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.2.7-8) says: Human society is naturally grouped into four divisions, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25). But if this system is neglected and the qualities and divisions of society are not considered, the result will be brahma-vi\u1e6d-k\u1e63atra-\u015b\u016bdr\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 yo bal\u012b bhavit\u0101 n\u1e5bpa\u1e25: the so-called caste system of br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra will be meaningless. As a result, whoever somehow or other becomes powerful will be the king or president, and thus the praj\u0101s, or citizens, will be so harassed that they will give up hearth and home and will go to the forest (y\u0101syanti giri-k\u0101nanam) to escape harassment by government officials who have no mercy and are addicted to the ways of plunderers. Therefore the praj\u0101s, or the people in general, must take to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement, which is the sound incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kali-k\u0101le n\u0101ma-r\u016bpe k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-avat\u0101ra: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has now appeared as an incarnation by His holy name. Therefore, when the praj\u0101s become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, they can then expect a good government and good society, a perfect life, and liberation from the bondage of material existence."

The surabhi cow is also called k\u0101madhenu. Although Jamadagni possessed only one k\u0101madhenu, he was able to get from it everything desirable. Thus he was able to receive the King, along with the King\u2019s great number of followers, ministers, soldiers, animals and palanquin carriers. When we speak of a king, we understand that he is accompanied by many followers. Jamadagni was able to receive all the King\u2019s followers properly and feed them sumptuously with food prepared in ghee. The King was astonished at how opulent Jamadagni was because of possessing only one cow, and therefore he became envious of the great sage. This was the beginning of his offense.

Therefore he and his own men, the Haihayas, were not very much appreciative of Jamadagni\u2019s reception. On the contrary, they wanted to possess that k\u0101madhenu, which was useful for the execution of the agnihotra sacrifice.",
        "purport": " Jamadagni was more powerful than K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna because of performing the agnihotra-yaj\u00f1a with clarified butter received from the k\u0101madhenu. Not everyone can be expected to possess such a cow. Nonetheless, an ordinary man may possess an ordinary cow, give protection to this animal, take sufficient milk from it, and engage the milk to produce butter and ghee, especially for performing the agnihotra-yaj\u00f1a. This is possible for everyone. Thus we find that in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises go-rak\u1e63ya, the protection of cows. This is essential because if cows are cared for properly they will surely supply sufficient milk. We have practical experience in America that in our various ISKCON farms we are giving proper protection to the cows and receiving more than enough milk. In other farms the cows do not deliver as much milk as in our farms; because our cows know very well that we are not going to kill them, they are happy, and they give ample milk. Therefore this instruction given by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 go-rak\u1e63ya \u2014 is extremely meaningful. The whole world must learn from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a how to live happily without scarcity simply by producing food grains (ann\u0101d bhavanti bh\u016bt\u0101ni) and giving protection to the cows (go-rak\u1e63ya). K\u1e5b\u1e63i-go-rak\u1e63ya-v\u0101\u1e47ijya\u1e41 vai\u015bya-karma svabh\u0101vajam. Those who belong to the third level of human society, namely the mercantile people, must keep land for producing food grains and giving protection to cows. This is the injunction of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. In the matter of protecting the cows, the meat-eaters will protest, but in answer to them we may say that since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives stress to cow protection, those who are inclined to eat meat may eat the flesh of unimportant animals like hogs, dogs, goats and sheep, but they should not touch the life of the cows, for this is destructive to the spiritual advancement of human society."

        "purport": " The word havirdh\u0101n\u012bm is significant in this verse. Havirdh\u0101n\u012bm refers to a cow required for supplying havis, or ghee, for the performance of ritualistic ceremonies in sacrifices. In human life, one should be trained to perform yaj\u00f1as. As we are informed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9), yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25: if we do not perform yaj\u00f1a, we shall simply work very hard for sense gratification like dogs and hogs. This is not civilization. A human being should be trained to perform yaj\u00f1a. Yaj\u00f1\u0101d bhavati parjanya\u1e25. If yaj\u00f1as are regularly performed, there will be proper rain from the sky, and when there is regular rainfall, the land will be fertile and suitable for producing all the necessities of life. Yaj\u00f1a, therefore, is essential. For performing yaj\u00f1a, clarified butter is essential, and for clarified butter, cow protection is essential. Therefore, if we neglect the Vedic way of civilization, we shall certainly suffer. So-called scholars and philosophers do not know the secret of success in life, and therefore they suffer in the hands of prak\u1e5bti, nature (prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 karm\u0101\u1e47i sarva\u015ba\u1e25). Nonetheless, although they are forced to suffer, they think they are advancing in civilization (aha\u1e45k\u0101ra-vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101tm\u0101 kart\u0101ham iti manyate). The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore meant to revive a mode of civilization in which everyone will be happy. This is the motive of our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Yaj\u00f1e sukhena bhavantu."
