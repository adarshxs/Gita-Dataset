To understand fully the actual nature of m\u0101y\u0101, the illusory potency, which causes the conditioned souls to become averse to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and surrender to bewildering material manifestations, King Nimi is inquiring from another of the nine Yogendras, \u015ar\u012b Antar\u012bk\u1e63a."

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, one may argue that since the symptoms of a pure devotee of the Lord have already been elaborately described, one can perfect his life by advancing to the platform mentioned in the previous verse, and there is no need for further questions. But hari-kath\u0101m\u1e5btam, topics about the Lord and His devotees, are so pleasing and beautiful that one cannot give up hearing them, even after spiritual liberation. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in this connection, has quoted the following verse: \u201cThose who are self-satisfied and unattracted by external, material desires are also attracted to the loving service of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whose qualities are transcendental and whose activities are wonderful. Hari, the Personality of Godhead, is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He has such transcendentally attractive features.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.7.10) Material medicine is not desirable once a disease has been cured, but on the absolute platform the means and the end are not different. So chanting and hearing the glories of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are both the means and the end of transcendental bliss. King Nimi said to the sages, \u201cYou are all great saintly persons absorbed in love of Godhead. Therefore although you will speak about m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, the conclusion will undoubtedly be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Please don\u2019t think that you have already explained everything to me. The intoxicating nectar of your instructions has left me more eager than ever to hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d King Nimi was also a great devotee of the Lord, otherwise there would have been no question of his personally conversing with such exalted living entities as the nine Yogendras. But as a humble Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava he considered himself an ordinary conditioned soul covered by material designations. Thus he showed his eagerness to understand the actual nature of m\u0101y\u0101 in order to be safe from her future attempts to place him in the burning fire of material existence."

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the illusory energy (m\u0101y\u0101) is explained in this verse through a description of her potencies, namely the modes of material nature. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has described m\u0101y\u0101 as gu\u1e47amay\u012b, \u201cconsisting of the material modes of nature.\u201d The material modes of nature are alluded to in this verse by the word ucc\u0101vac\u0101ni, \u201chigh and low species of life.\u201d Various species of life become manifest, as do varieties of beauty, ugliness, strength, weakness and other characteristics within a particular species, according to the proportionate development of the modes of nature. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.22), k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go\u00a0\u2019sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu: \u201cThis is due to the living being\u2019s association with material nature in good and evil species.\u201d Similarly we find this statement: \u201cThose situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets, those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets, and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.\u201d (Bg. 14.18) The three general divisions of material life are called deva, tiryak and nara \u2014 that is, demigods, subhuman creatures and human beings. In the various species of life there are various facilities for material sense gratification. Different species are distinguished by differently formed senses, such as the genitals, nostrils, tongue, ears and eyes. Pigeons, for example, are given the facility for almost unlimited sex. Bears have an ample opportunity for sleeping. Tigers and lions exhibit the propensities for fighting and meat-eating, horses are distinguished by their legs for swift running, vultures and eagles have keen eyesight, and so on. The human being is distinguished by his large brain, which is meant for understanding God. The phrase sva-m\u0101tr\u0101tma-prasiddhaye is very significant in this verse. The word sva indicates possession. All living beings belong to the Supreme Lord (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25). Therefore according to this verse they have two options \u2014 m\u0101tr\u0101-prasiddhaye and \u0101tma-prasiddhaye. M\u0101tr\u0101 refers to the material senses, and prasiddhaye refers to effective accomplishment. Therefore m\u0101tr\u0101-prasiddhaye means \u201cefficiently engaging in sense gratification.\u201d On the other hand, \u0101tma-prasiddhaye refers to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There are two categories of \u0101tm\u0101 \u2014 the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101, or ordinary living entity, who is dependent, and the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the supreme living entity, who is independent. Some living entities desire to understand both categories of \u0101tm\u0101, and in this verse the word \u0101tma-prasiddhaye indicates that the material world is created to give those living entities the opportunity to achieve such an understanding and thus return to the kingdom of God, where life is eternal and full of bliss and knowledge. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b confirms this by quoting a verse from the veda-stuti of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.87.2): \u201cThe Lord created the intelligence, senses, mind and vital air of the living beings for sense gratification, for performing sacrifices to attain higher births, and ultimately for offering sacrifices to the Supreme Soul.\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the actual purpose of the Lord\u2019s creation is only one: to facilitate the advancement of devotional service to the Lord Himself. Although it is stated that the Lord facilitates sense gratification, it should be understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not ultimately condone the foolishness of the conditioned souls. The Lord facilitates sense gratification (m\u0101tr\u0101-prasiddhaye) so that the living entities will gradually understand the futility of trying to enjoy without Him. Every living entity is part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the Vedic literature the Lord gives a regulative program so that the living beings can gradually exhaust their tendencies to be foolish and learn the value of surrender unto Him. The Lord is undoubtedly the reservoir of all beauty, bliss and satisfaction, and it is the duty of every living entity to engage in the loving service of the Lord. Although there are apparently two purposes for creation, it should be understood that ultimately the purpose is one. The arrangement for sense gratification is ultimately meant to bring the living entities to the single purpose of going back home, back to Godhead."

The one Supersoul enters the gross material elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether) and uses the activated material mind to subtly divide the sensory activities of the conditioned souls among the five knowledge-acquiring senses (the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin) and, by a further gross division, the five working senses (the hands, legs, speech, genitals and anus). Because liberated souls have a strong tendency to serve the Lord, they are not attracted by the dualities of material good and evil. They derive their pleasure through devotion and love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who eternally enjoys His own transcendental pastimes beyond the material manifestation. When the conditioned souls forget their loving relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they develop illicit desires. Therefore, unable to serve the form, taste, fragrance and other aspects of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, these souls become bound to the bitter fruits of fruitive activities. But if their love of Godhead is somehow or other awakened, the conditioned souls can dovetail all their sensory activities in the service of the Lord\u2019s transcendental pastimes. Actually, all materialistic activities are most undesirable. But the conditioned soul, under the influence of illusion, sees apparent distinctions between good and bad, pleasing and displeasing, and so on. The Lord, the Supersoul, having entered the collective and individual consciousness of the living entities, knows the heart of everyone. Therefore when a sincere soul aspires for spiritual perfection, the Lord frees him from material bondage and arouses his propensity to serve the Lord of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Love of Godhead flourishes in the variegated flavors of transcendental enjoyment. In ignorance, however, the conditioned soul considers himself the proper object of service and thus misunderstands the entire existential situation."

        "translation": "The individual living being, the master of the material body, uses his material senses, which have been activated by the Supersoul, to try to enjoy sense objects composed of the three modes of nature. Thus he misidentifies the created material body with the unborn eternal self and becomes entangled in the illusory energy of the Lord.",
        "purport": " In this verse the living entity is called prabhu\u1e25, or \u201cmaster,\u201d because he is a minute part and parcel of the supreme master, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.8) the Lord has described the living entity as \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25, \u201cthe controller.\u201d \u201cThe living entity in the material world carries his various conceptions of life from one body to another as the air carries aromas.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has commented in his purport, \u201cHere the living entity is described as \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25, the controller of his own body. If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body undergoes depends upon him.\u201d This statement confirms the words sva-m\u0101tr\u0101 and \u0101tma-prasiddhaye in text 3 of this chapter. If the Supreme Lord were to interfere with the minute independence of the living entity, there would be no question of the living entity\u2019s engaging in the loving service of the Lord, since love implies a spontaneous free choice by the lover. Here the word prabhu\u1e25 indicates that just as a child, having received a toy car from his father, pedals on the sidewalk, imitating the father, who drives an actual car, the living entity pedals around the material universe in the innumerable material bodies selected for him by the Supreme Lord from an assortment of 8,400,000 species. Thus the living entity, infatuated with the false ego of the material body, creates a fearful situation in which he undergoes repeated birth and death, as described in the statement bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101t (Bh\u0101g. 11.2.37). \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has given another explanation for this verse. If the word prabhu\u1e25 is taken to mean the Supreme Lord, the word gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 can be understood to mean \u201cgood qualities,\u201d since gu\u1e47a can refer to the material modes of nature or to admirable qualities (as in the verse yasy\u0101sti bhaktir bhagavaty aki\u00f1can\u0101 sarvair gu\u1e47ais tatra sam\u0101sate sur\u0101\u1e25). This verse would then mean that the Lord, by His transcendental qualities (gu\u1e47ai\u1e25), such as mercy, is able to relish the transcendental qualities (gu\u1e47\u0101n) of His pure devotees. \u0100tma-pratyoditai\u1e25 would then indicate that by surrendering unto the Lord, who is the reservoir of all good qualities, the pure devotees become similarly endowed with godly qualities. The words manyam\u0101na ida\u1e41 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam \u0101tm\u0101nam would indicate that the Lord accepts the body of His pure devotee to be on the same spiritual level as He Himself, as indicated in the verse \u0101c\u0101rya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 vij\u0101n\u012by\u0101n n\u0101vamanyeta karhicit. The Lord is attracted by the loving devotional service of His pure devotees and thus becomes entangled in the network of their loving relationship with Him. For example, after the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was leaving for His own city, Dv\u0101rak\u0101, the loving appeal of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira forced the Lord to remain for several more weeks in Hastin\u0101pura. Similarly, when the elderly gop\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana clapped their hands, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would dance like a puppet, keeping time to their rhythm. In relation to this subject matter, \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has quoted a verse from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (9.4.68): \u201cThe pure devotee is always within the core of My heart, and I am always in the heart of the pure devotee. My devotees do not know anything but Me, and I do not know anyone but them.\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura the word prabhu\u1e25 may also be understood as follows. The word pra indicates prakar\u1e63e\u1e47a, or \u201cexcessively,\u201d and bh\u016b indicates bhavati, or \u201ctaking birth.\u201d Thus prabhu\u1e25 indicates prakar\u1e63e\u1e47a deva-tiryag-\u0101di\u1e63u bhavat\u012bti sa\u1e25, or repeatedly taking birth among the demigods, animals, human beings and other forms of life. Confirming the statement by \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b concerning the Lord\u2019s attachment to the spiritualized body of a pure devotee, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has quoted the following verses from Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Antya 4.192-93): \u201cAt the time of initiation, when a devotee fully surrenders unto the service of the Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a accepts him to be as good as Himself.\u201d \u201cWhen the devotee\u2019s body is thus transformed into spiritual existence, the devotee, in that transcendental body, renders service to the lotus feet of the Lord.\u201d"

        "translation": "Impelled by deep-rooted material desires, the embodied living entity engages his active sense organs in fruitive activities. He then experiences the results of his material actions by wandering throughout this world in so-called happiness and distress.",
        "purport": " The argument may be given that if a living entity were subject to the results of his previous activities there would be no scope for free will; once having committed a sinful action, the living entity would be bound in an endless chain of suffering, being perpetually subject to previous reactions. According to this speculation there cannot be a just and omniscient God, since the living entity is forced to commit sinful activities by the reactions of his previous activities, which were reactions to still previous activities. Since even an ordinary gentleman will not unfairly punish an innocent person, how could there be a God witnessing the helpless suffering of the conditioned souls within this world? This foolish argument can easily be refuted by a practical example. If I purchase a ticket for an airline flight, board the plane and commence the flight, once the plane has taken off my decision to board the plane forces me to continue flying until the plane lands. But although I am forced to accept the reaction of this decision, on board the plane I have many new decisions I can make. I may accept the food and drink from the stewardesses or reject it, I may read a magazine or newspaper, I may sleep, walk up and down the aisle, converse with other passengers, and so on. In other words, although the general context \u2014 flying to a particular city \u2014 is forcibly imposed upon me as a reaction to my previous decision to board the plane, even within that situation I am constantly making new decisions and creating new reactions. For example, if I cause a disturbance on the airplane I may be arrested when the plane lands. On the other hand, if I make friends with a businessman sitting next to me on the plane, such a contact may lead to a favorable business transaction in the future. Similarly, although the living entity is forced to accept a particular body by the laws of karma, within the human form of life there is always scope for free will and decision-making. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be considered unjust for holding the living entity in human life responsible for his present activities despite the living entity\u2019s undergoing the reactions of his previous work. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 is so strong that even in a hellish condition the proud conditioned soul thinks that he is enjoying life."

        "translation": "Then Vair\u0101ja Brahm\u0101, the soul of the universal form, gives up his universal body, O King, and enters into the subtle unmanifest nature, like a fire that has run out of fuel.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura the word vair\u0101ja\u1e25 in this verse indicates the totality of the individual conditioned souls who originally take birth from Brahm\u0101 and are amalgamated back into him at the time of annihilation. By the manifestation of the vir\u0101\u1e6d-puru\u1e63a, the universal form of the Lord, there is a temporary display of forms, qualities and activities within the material creation. But the entire cosmic scene reverts to inert formlessness when the creation is withdrawn by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord\u2019s universal form cannot be accepted as an eternal form of the Lord. It is merely the temporary imaginary resemblance of His personal form within the kingdom of m\u0101y\u0101. In the First Canto of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, as well as in the Second Canto, the universal form of the Lord is clearly explained to be an imaginary form offered to the neophyte for meditation on God. Those who are excessively materialistic are totally unable to understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, or the eternal form of bliss and knowledge, transcendental to the exhibition of material energy. Therefore to encourage such gross materialists to become faithful theists, the Vedic literature instructs them to meditate upon the physical universe as the gigantic body of the Supreme Lord. This pantheistic conception does not reflect the ultimate reality of the Supreme Lord but is a technique to bring the mind gradually toward God. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has quoted the following verse as evidence that Lord Brahm\u0101 is supposed to go back to Godhead at the time of annihilation: \u201cAt the time of final annihilation all self-realized souls enter with Brahm\u0101 into the supreme abode.\u201d Since Brahm\u0101 is sometimes considered the best devotee of the Supreme Lord, he surely should obtain liberation rather than merely entering into the unmanifest state of material nature called avyakta. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b points out that there is a class of nondevotees who attain the planet of Brahm\u0101 by performing a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1as and other sacrifices, and in certain cases Brahm\u0101 himself may not be a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So the words avyakta\u1e41 vi\u015bate s\u016bk\u1e63mam can be understood to indicate that such a nondevotee Brahm\u0101 cannot enter the spiritual sky, despite having achieved the ultimate universal status of material expertise. But when Brahm\u0101 is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the word avyaktam can be taken to indicate the spiritual sky; since the spiritual sky is not manifest to the conditioned souls, it may also be considered avyakta. If even Lord Brahm\u0101 cannot enter the kingdom of God without surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then what to speak of other so-called pious or expert nondevotees. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that there are three categories within the status of Brahm\u0101, namely those of karm\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b and devotee. A Brahm\u0101 who is the most exalted karm\u012b of the universe will have to come back to the material world; a living entity who has achieved the post of Brahm\u0101 by being the greatest speculative philosopher within the universe may attain impersonal liberation; and a living entity who has been awarded the post of Brahm\u0101 due to being a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead enters into the personal abode of the Lord. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.32.15) yet another case is described: a Brahm\u0101 who is a devotee of the Lord but who has the tendency to think himself independent of or equal to the Lord may achieve Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s abode at the time of annihilation, but when creation begins again he has to return and again take the post of Brahm\u0101. The word used in this case is bheda-d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dy\u0101, which refers to the tendency to think oneself independently powerful. The various destinations possible for such an exalted living entity as a Lord Brahm\u0101 definitely prove that any material position is worthless for guaranteeing an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a promises that if one gives up all other so-called obligations and surrenders to the devotional service of the Lord, the Lord will personally protect him and bring him back to the supreme abode in the spiritual sky. It is futile and foolish to try to achieve perfection by one\u2019s own strenuous endeavor and not surrender to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such a blind attempt is described in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as bahul\u0101y\u0101sam, indicating that it is work in the material mode of passion. Brahm\u0101 is the lord of passion, and his creation and management of the entire universe are certainly bahul\u0101y\u0101sam, or strenuous endeavor, in the most exalted sense. But all such passionate work, even that of Lord Brahm\u0101, is ultimately useless without surrender to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "purport": " King Nimi had expressed to the nava-yogendras his fear of the illusory potency of the Lord and had requested a detailed explanation of m\u0101y\u0101 so that he could avoid becoming a victim at her hands. Now, \u015ar\u012b Antar\u012bk\u1e63a, having described the illusory potency, is suggesting that the King inquire about the means to become totally free of m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s influence. Not waiting for the King to ask such a question, \u015ar\u012b Antar\u012bk\u1e63a himself is suggesting, \u201cNow that you have heard about m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s influence, you should inquire about the process of becoming free of such influence.\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, that is the significance of \u015ar\u012b Antar\u012bk\u1e63a\u2019s question ki\u1e41 bh\u016bya\u1e25 \u015brotum icchasi, \u201cWhat more do you wish to hear?\u201d The following is a summary of \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura\u2019s explanation of the process of annihilation described in the previous verses. V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the presiding Deity of consciousness, which becomes manifest within the mahat-tattva. By further transformations of the mahat-tattva the threefold false ego appears as follows. (1) From vaik\u0101rika, false ego in the mode of goodness, appears the eleventh sense, the mind, whose presiding Deity is Aniruddha. (2) From taijasa, false ego in the mode of passion, comes intelligence, whose presiding Deity is Pradyumna, and the five working senses and five knowledge-acquiring senses with their various presiding deities. (3) From false ego in the mode of ignorance arises the subtle form of sound, and from that sound, or \u015babda, all the material elements gradually become manifest, beginning with ether and the sense of hearing. The presiding Deity of these three divisions of false ego is Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. This description is taken from Chapter Twenty-six of the Third Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, verses 21, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32 and 35. The Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s external potency, m\u0101y\u0101, causes the birth, maintenance and destruction of the material world. She is tricolored red, white and black. In her red feature the material nature is created, in white it endures, and in black it is annihilated. The mahat-tattva arises from this m\u0101y\u0101, and from the mahat-tattva come the three varieties of false ego mentioned above. At the time of annihilation the five great elements, namely earth, water, fire, air and ether, merge into false ego in the mode of ignorance, from which they were originally generated; the ten senses and intelligence merge into false ego in passion; and the mind, along with the demigods, merges into false ego in the mode of goodness, which then merges into mahat-tattva, which further takes shelter of the prak\u1e5bti or unmanifest pradh\u0101na. As described above, each of the gross elements is wound up when its distinguishing quality is removed; the element then merges into the previous element. This can be understood as follows. In space or ether there is the quality of sound. In air there are the qualities of sound and touch. In fire there are sound, touch and form. In water there are sound, touch, form and taste. And in earth there are sound, touch, form, taste and aroma. Therefore from ether down to earth each element is distinguished by the addition of its own unique quality, called gu\u1e47a-vi\u015be\u1e63am. When that quality is removed, an element becomes nondifferent from its previous element and thus merges into it. For example, when great winds take aroma away from earth, earth contains only sound, touch, form and taste and thus becomes nondifferent from water, into which it merges. Similarly when water loses its rasa, or taste, it contains only sound, touch and form, thus becoming nondifferent from fire, which also contains those three qualities. So the wind takes away aroma to merge earth into water and takes away taste to merge water into fire. Then when the universal darkness removes form from fire, fire merges into air. Space then removes the sense of touch from air, and air merges into space. The Supreme Personality of Godhead as the time element removes sound from space, and space then merges into the false ego in the mode of ignorance, from which it arose. Finally, false ego is merged into the mahat-tattva, which is merged into the unmanifest pradh\u0101na, and thus the universe is annihilated."

        "translation": "King Nimi said: O great sage, please explain how even a foolish materialist can easily cross over the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord, which is always insurmountable for those who are not self-controlled.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, sth\u016bla-dhiya\u1e25 indicates those who ignorantly identify themselves with the gross material body and who are therefore unable to analyze the subtle laws of nature by which the soul transmigrates in illusion. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b comments that sth\u016bla-dhiya\u1e25 also indicates so-called pious persons who execute pompous religious ceremonies for material sense gratification rather than trying to prepare themselves to go back home, back to Godhead, by engaging in the loving devotional service of the Lord. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, King Nimi was already an advanced devotee of the Lord and therefore knew that one can cross over the illusory energy, m\u0101y\u0101, by surrendering to the lotus feet of the Lord and pleasing Him by pure devotional service. Therefore the King was asking the question for the benefit of those who falsely consider themselves very much learned but in fact are addicted to materialistic fruitive activities, which increasingly entangle them in illusion. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has quoted from the Amara-ko\u015ba dictionary to show that ak\u1e5bt\u0101tmabhi\u1e25 indicates ap\u016br\u1e47atvam, or one whose life is empty. Every living being has an eternal relationship with the supreme living being, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One may love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by thinking of Him as one\u2019s eternal master, one\u2019s most intimate friend, one\u2019s beloved child or the object of one\u2019s conjugal attraction. Of course, such ecstasies should never be confused with ordinary, material emotions, which are perverted reflections of spiritual rasas, or relationships. In the material world we try to relish these same relationships of servitude, friendship, parental love and conjugal love, but the object of such feelings is a temporary material body, which is quickly devastated by the laws of nature. These loving feelings should be directed toward the spiritual body of the Supreme Personality, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the reservoir of all beauty and transcendental bliss. One who has not learned the art of directing his love to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ap\u016br\u1e47a, or one whose life is ultimately empty. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, one whose life is empty can also be called manda-dh\u012b\u1e25, or one whose intelligence is crippled by a lack of broad experience. King Nimi, a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, was so kind that he asked, \u201cHow can such cripple-minded people cross over m\u0101y\u0101 in the easiest way possible, since by nature they are very lazy in spiritual matters?\u201d"

And since one\u2019s residence in heaven is finished with the exhaustion of pious fruitive activities, the denizens of heaven are afflicted by fear, anticipating the destruction of their heavenly life. Thus they resemble kings who, though enviously admired by ordinary citizens, are constantly harassed by enemy kings and who therefore never attain actual happiness.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has quoted the following text from the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad (8.1.6): tad yatheha karma-cito loka\u1e25 k\u1e63\u012byate, evam ev\u0101mutra pu\u1e47ya-cito loka\u1e25 k\u1e63\u012byate. \u201cOne\u2019s present status of material pleasure, the result of one\u2019s previous work, will eventually be vanquished by time. Similarly, although by executing pious activities one will be elevated to a higher status in the next life, that future situation will also be vanquished.\u201d The basis of material enjoyment is the particular body one has acquired. The material body is karma-cita\u1e25, the accumulated result of one\u2019s previous material activities. If one is awarded a body decorated with beauty, education, popularity, strength and so on, his standard of material enjoyment is certainly high class. On the other hand, if one is ugly, mentally retarded, crippled or repulsive to others, there is very little hope for his material happiness. In both cases, however, the situation is flickering and temporary. One who has acquired an attractive body should not rejoice, since death will quickly bring an end to such an intoxicating situation. Similarly, one who has taken birth in an obnoxious situation should not lament, since his suffering is also temporary. The beautiful man and the ugly man, the rich and the poor, the educated and the foolish should all endeavor to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious so that they can be elevated to their eternal constitutional situation, which is to reside in the planets beyond this material universe. Originally every living entity is unimaginably beautiful, intelligent, wealthy, and so strong that his spiritual body lives forever. But we foolishly give up this eternal, blissful situation because we are unwilling to meet the condition for eternal life. The condition is that one should be a lover of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most exquisite ecstasy, surpassing by millions of times the most intense pleasure of the material universe, we foolishly break off our loving affair with the Supreme Lord and artificially try to become independent enjoyers in the material atmosphere of self-delusion and false pride. Even if one reaches the exalted heavenly planets of this universe he will be afflicted by various types of suffering. Every conditioned soul in the material world wants to become the greatest person. Therefore one is constantly harassed by his equals who have a similar desire. This situation is commonly termed the \u201crat race\u201d of material existence. Even on the heavenly planets there is a similar rat race for heavenly distinction. Since some persons inevitably excel our own achievements, our hearts burn with envy upon seeing others enjoying the very rewards we have strived for. And because our whole situation is temporary, we must undergo fear, anxiety and death even on the heavenly planets. The example given here is very nice. Minor kings may be enviously admired by ordinary citizens for their wealth, power and fame, but such kings themselves constantly burn with jealousy, resentment and fear due to rivalry and threats from other kings. Similarly, modern politicians are constantly harassed by envy and fear. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that the conditioned souls, being eager to acquire material happiness and avoid distress, take shelter of sexual relationships and thus surrender to the hard labor of fruitive activities. Those who are enlightened, however, can perceive the ultimate futility of such gross materialistic endeavors. One\u2019s so-called wife, home, children, relatives, bank account and so on are all temporary phantasmagoria, and even while manifest they can never give real satisfaction to one\u2019s senses. To acquire wealth in this world one is practically forced to become the killer of his own soul. There is no possibility of acquiring pleasure from materialistic activities, since they are performed with temporary senses in the hot pursuit of temporary sense objects. When the conditioned soul achieves his goal he becomes proud and brags to others as if his achievements were permanent. And when defeated he is submerged in lamentation. Such a tendency to consider oneself the doer is a sign of weak intelligence, since in fact the living entity is merely desiring within the material body. The body itself is moved by the forces of material nature, under the control of God. The relationships of master and servant, father and son, husband and wife entail exchanges of well-wishing and service that give a sense of material gratification, but such ephemeral devotion can never bring about the eternal absolute benefit of the soul. By such temporary gratification, m\u0101y\u0101 induces the conditioned soul to wander throughout the material world, pursuing the relative rewards of material nature. According to the subtle laws of karma, the living entity achieves happiness and distress. One cannot obtain happiness by force, no matter how strenuously or how long one tries. Therefore those whose intelligence is uncontaminated should surrender at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and give up the ludicrous pursuit of permanent material happiness, a pursuit which can be compared to a dog\u2019s chasing its tail."

        "translation": "Therefore any person who seriously desires real happiness must seek a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of the bona fide guru is that he has realized the conclusions of the scriptures by deliberation and is able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities, who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, should be understood to be bona fide spiritual masters.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the word \u015b\u0101bde refers to the Vedic literature, and pare refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The bona fide spiritual master must be ni\u1e63\u1e47\u0101tam, deeply experienced in authorized Vedic literatures and in practical understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without scriptural knowledge and practical realization of the Personality of Godhead, a so-called guru will be unable to dissipate the doubts of his disciples and therefore unable to execute the function of bringing the sincere student back home, back to Godhead. The symptom of realized understanding of the Vedas and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is upa\u015bam\u0101\u015brayam. In other words, the bona fide spiritual master is one who has retired from the glittering illusions of materialistic society, friendship and love. Within the material world one is certainly attracted to becoming a great intellectual, a powerful politician, the loving father of many beautiful and affectionate little children, a most honored welfare worker or a highly admired and successful businessman. But none of these material positions have a permanent basis, nor do they afford permanent happiness, because they are all based on the primary misunderstanding by which one identifies himself with the material body. Anyone can readily experience that he is not the body but consciousness. Even if one loses a limb of his body, he does not cease to exist as a conscious entity. Ultimately, the entire body is lost at the time of death, and the living entity acquires a new body. The preliminary understanding of one\u2019s identity as consciousness is called self-realization. But beyond this elementary knowledge is the elaborate subject matter of how the soul came to exist within the cycle of 8,400,000 material species of life. And if the living entity is not the material body but consciousness, he must ultimately have an original status on a higher platform. Punishment implies reward also; a powerful man who can punish is also able to reward. Therefore, the existence of punishment for the living being, who is forced to take a miserable material body subject to birth, old age, disease and death, also logically implies the existence of a reward for him. Although we mistakenly consider material sense gratification the ultimate reward of life, material happiness is actually another type of punishment, since it entices one to continue rotating in the cycle of birth and death. In the Western countries violent prisoners are placed in solitary confinement whereas well-behaved prisoners are sometimes allowed to work in the warden\u2019s garden or library as a reward. But any position in prison is ultimately a punishment. Similarly, the existence of higher and lower categories of material sense gratification does not explain the living entity\u2019s ultimate reward, which must constitute the natural antithesis of the punishment of material existence. That actual reward is an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in the kingdom of God, where there is no punishment. The kingdom of God is Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, or unconditional pleasure. There is no punishment in the spiritual world; it is a place of ever-increasing pleasure. A bona fide spiritual master is one who is expert in all of these subject matters, not by his personal imagination or speculation but by mature understanding of the authorized Vedic literatures, which are the literary manifestation of the causeless mercy of God. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.3): \u201cThose who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world.\u201d Therefore the spiritual master must awaken the disciple to the eternal existence of devotional service. The example may be given that in the early morning a mother may enter her child\u2019s room to wake him up so that he can attend school. The child does not want to get up, but the loving mother forces him to get up and sends him off to school to be educated. Similarly, the bona fide spiritual master awakens the sleeping soul and sends him to the gurukula, or the \u0101\u015brama of the spiritual master, where he can be trained in perfect knowledge. If the disciple has doubts about the value of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the bona fide spiritual master must dissipate those doubts by superior knowledge. One who himself doubts the authority of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Vedic knowledge cannot become a bona fide spiritual master. On the other hand, kib\u0101 vipra, kib\u0101 ny\u0101s\u012b, \u015b\u016bdra kena naya/ yei k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-tattva-vett\u0101, sei\u00a0\u2018guru\u2019 haya: any human being from any social or economic status can become a bona fide spiritual master if he knows the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said: \u201cInstruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as they are given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land.\u201d (Cc. Madhya 7.128) Only by the order and authority of the Supreme Lord one can become a spiritual master, not by one\u2019s own so-called erudition. The duty of the bona fide guru is to connect the disciple to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A scholar or meditator has no potency to connect another living being with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a if that scholar or meditator himself is not connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although many sports fans attend gymnastic competitions and applaud at the exhibition of difficult calisthenic feats, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not such a gymnastic spectator, and He does not applaud the calisthenics exhibited by foolish persons in the name of yoga. Nor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead impressed by mediocre attempts at philosophical speculation, since the Lord has already given His own opinion in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (\u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u me parama\u1e41 vaca\u1e25). The word of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is parama\u1e41 vaca\u1e25, the last word in knowledge. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, yaj j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 neha bh\u016byo\u00a0\u2019nyaj j\u00f1\u0101tavyam ava\u015bi\u1e63yate: \u201cWhen you know this knowledge there shall remain nothing further to be known.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has also referred to His knowledge as r\u0101ja-vidy\u0101, the king of all knowledge. If one does not become a lover of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a takes place indirectly, through the illusory potency of the Lord. The idea that one can attract the Supreme Lord through mere gymnastics or foolish speculation on the Absolute Truth is certainly a product of m\u0101y\u0101. One who is connected to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through His external, illusory potency can serve only as a material master to connect his so-called disciples to the same illusory energy. On the other hand, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.13) it is said: Those who are actually great souls have surrendered to the internal potency of the Lord and can similarly connect others to the internal pleasure-giving potency. A mah\u0101tm\u0101 is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as follows: v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25. \u201cHe knows Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.\u201d It is to such a spiritual master, who has reached the mature understanding that V\u0101sudeva is everything, that one must surrender. According to \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni, yo vidv\u0101n sa gurur hari\u1e25: such a great soul is to be considered the external manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states this also: \u201cOne should know the \u0101c\u0101rya to be My self and never disrespect him in any way. One should not envy him, thinking him an ordinary man, for he is the representative of all the demigods.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.17.27) According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, if a spiritual master cannot destroy his disciple\u2019s doubts by superior knowledge, the disciple will gradually become despondent in spiritual life. Because a bogus guru cannot actually give K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to the disciple according to the principle of rasa-varja\u1e41 raso\u00a0\u2019py asya, the disciple will again become attracted to material happiness, not having achieved the bliss of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s association. Such a weak disciple of a weak spiritual master will gradually become hopeless and discouraged in his attempt at self-realization and will again become fascinated by the temptations of illusion, such as women, money and so-called intellectuality based on speculation and imagination. Further symptoms of the bona fide spiritual master are given in the Upade\u015b\u0101m\u1e5bta (1) as follows: \u201cA sober person who can tolerate the urge to speak, the mind\u2019s demands, the actions of anger and the urges of the tongue, belly and genitals is qualified to make disciples all over the world.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has stated, upa\u015bam\u0101\u015braya\u1e41 krodha-lobh\u0101dy-ava\u015b\u012b-bh\u016btam: a bona fide spiritual master cannot be under the control of ordinary anger, greed and lust. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, one who has understood the futility of material existence can approach a bona fide spiritual master. In the two previous verses the futility of earthly and heavenly sense gratification has been described. Now, the natural conclusion is that one who has understood this should approach a bona fide spiritual master. The bona fide spiritual master broadcasts the sound vibration from the spiritual planets called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. The inhabitants of the spiritual planets, headed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, are certainly not deaf and dumb; they are in constant communication through unlimited transcendental bliss and knowledge. And the bona fide spiritual master can transmit this sound vibration of bliss and knowledge to his disciple. Just as a radio broadcasts mundane news, the bona fide guru broadcasts the news from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. This is confirmed by Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura: golokera prema-dhana, hari-n\u0101ma-sa\u1e45k\u012brtana. The spiritual master also transmits to the disciple the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is nondifferent from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. The bona fide guru informs his disciple that every living entity is qualitatively one with the Supreme Lord but quantitatively different and thus engages the disciple in the loving service of the Lord. Because the living entity is qualitatively one with the Lord and is part of Him, there is an eternal loving relationship between them. And because the living entity is quantitatively different, that relationship is eternally one of service. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, even though one may have the good fortune to accept a bona fide, highly qualified guru, if one maintains a taste for fruitive activities or mental speculation one\u2019s advancement will be checked. But if a serious student surrenders to a bona fide spiritual master there is absolutely no impediment to the transmission of perfect knowledge and bliss in the devotional service of the Lord."

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b the Lord\u2019s tendency to give Himself to His pure devotee is demonstrated in the case of Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who sacrificed his universal kingdom for the pleasure of Lord V\u0101manadeva. Lord V\u0101mana was so pleased by the selfless surrender of Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that the Lord became the doorman in the palace of Bali, who was reinstalled as a great leader in the universe. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b comments that the spiritual master is to be considered the \u0101tm\u0101, or the very life, of the disciple, since real life begins when one is initiated by a bona fide spiritual master. Although one may experience many seemingly wonderful or important events in a dream, one\u2019s real life begins when he wakes up. Similarly, since the spiritual master gives birth to the disciple by awakening him to spiritual life, a bona fide disciple understands that his spiritual master is the very basis of his life. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all pleasure, and thus the Lord\u2019s giving Himself to a pure devotee indicates that such a devotee becomes immersed in the highest possible ecstasy. In this connection there is the following \u015bruti-mantra: \u0101nand\u0101d dh\u012bm\u0101ni bh\u016bt\u0101ni j\u0101yante. \u201cIndeed, it is from the all-blissful Supreme that all these creatures have come into being.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has further pointed out that when the Lord bestows His own self upon a pure devotee such a fortunate devotee can actually see the Lord, touch Him and directly engage in His service. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, one should never consider one\u2019s spiritual master to be mundane or on an equal level with one\u2019s self. One should see the spiritual master as being always under the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. One should never try to engage the spiritual master in one\u2019s personal service with the mentality of lording it over the spiritual master and attaining through him some material gain. One who is actually advancing will become more and more eager to serve the spiritual master, and thus such a disciple experiences the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has delineated four preliminary requisites for advancement for the sincere disciple: \u201c[1] Accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master, [2] becoming initiated by the spiritual master and learning how to discharge devotional service from him, [3] obeying the orders of the spiritual master with faith and devotion, and [4] following in the footsteps of great \u0101c\u0101ryas [teachers] under the direction of the spiritual master.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.74) One who has executed these preliminary duties is qualified to relish \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. When one actually hears the sound vibration of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as it is, he becomes free from the desire for sense gratification and mental speculation and is happy and satisfied in the service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u201cSimply by giving aural reception to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the feeling for loving devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, sprouts up at once to extinguish the fire of lamentation, illusion and fearfulness.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.7.7) One should hear \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from a bona fide spiritual master who can expertly engage the propensity for loving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that arises from hearing the transcendental sound of the Bh\u0101gavatam. Such a transcendental, authorized engagement is called bh\u0101gavata-dharma. Within the International Society for Krishna Consciousness there are many thousands of authorized engagements pertaining to the Society\u2019s missionary activities. And by hearing the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and performing such engagements the Society\u2019s members feel relief from \u015boka (lamentation), moha (illusion) and bhaya (fear). According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, those who have achieved a mature understanding of the transcendental sound vibration of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam may adopt the order of trida\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101sa, as described in the Ha\u1e41sa-g\u012bt\u0101, the Thirteenth Chapter of this canto. A so-called Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava who whimsically neglects the strict control of the body, mind and speech cannot actually achieve shelter at the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. Even if such a whimsical sense enjoyer makes a show of assuming the dress and da\u1e47\u1e0da of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101sa, he will not attain the desired result, love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A bona fide Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should work earnestly to free himself from any tinge of sense gratification and mental speculation, and with a loving heart he should carry out the orders of his bona fide spiritual master. By always remembering the exalted position of the bona fide spiritual master, the disciple will achieve shelter at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

He should be merciful to those in an inferior position to him, cultivate friendship with those on an equal level and meekly serve those in a higher spiritual position.

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted from the Garu\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a to demonstrate that within this universe those who take birth as demigods, great \u1e5b\u1e63is or pious human beings are all considered santa\u1e25, or saintly persons. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, traigu\u1e47ya-vi\u1e63ay\u0101 ved\u0101\u1e25: the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama culture described in Vedic literature deals mostly with the living entities who are struggling within the three modes of nature. The Vedic literatures teach such conditioned souls that material happiness can be achieved only through pious works. In this sense, the demigods are to be considered the most pious living entities within the three modes of material nature. The \u1e5b\u1e63is, or the great saintly mystics of the universe, who are able to travel at will to various planets and who cultivate mystic powers, are to be considered somewhat below the demigods. And those human beings on earth who perfectly execute the Vedic rituals are to be considered in the third or lowest category of santa\u1e25, or saintly persons. But a devotee of the Lord is beyond the three modes of material nature. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says that a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava who does not fall down from the regulations of bhakti-yoga is beyond the three modes of nature. And Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advised Arjuna, a k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-bhakta, to transcend the three material qualities of the illusory creation of m\u0101y\u0101 (nistraigu\u1e47yo bhav\u0101rjuna). But in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.40) the Lord says: \u201cThere is no being existing, either here or among the demigods in the higher planetary systems, who is free from the three modes of material nature.\u201d Thus the demigods are not exempt from the pollution of the three modes of material nature, whereas a pure devotee actually becomes gu\u1e47\u0101t\u012bta, or transcendental to the influence of m\u0101y\u0101. Therefore, one should cultivate the association of the uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b, or pure devotee of the Lord, as stated previously (Bh\u0101g. 11.3.21): \u201cTherefore any person who seriously desires real happiness must seek a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of the bona fide guru is that he has realized the conclusions of the scriptures by deliberation and is able to convince others of these conclusions. Such great personalities, who have taken shelter of the Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, should be understood to be bona fide spiritual masters.\u201d On the other hand, one should avoid the association of a materialistic person even if such a person is outwardly chanting the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has advised in this respect: One may mentally offer respect to any living entity who is chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but one should avoid intimate association with materialistic persons, especially those attached to sex enjoyment. Tamo-dv\u0101ra\u1e41 yo\u1e63it\u0101\u1e41 sa\u1e45gi-sa\u1e45gam. If one associates with a sensuous person who is attached to the company of women, by such association one will surely go to hell. But if a materialistic person approaches a pure devotee with a sincere desire to hear from him about spiritual improvement, that first-class devotee may mercifully give his association, provided the purpose of such a meeting is advancement in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By such association even a materialistic person can gradually become a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If an advanced devotee is not able to engage a materialistic person in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, such association is strictly forbidden. In the Garu\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is stated: \u201cOne cannot be liberated without association with a pure devotee of the Lord. And unless one shows mercy to those in an inferior position, one\u2019s life will be superficial.\u201d It is our practical experience in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement that those who are expanding their mercy by preaching the message of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are making rapid spiritual progress, and their life is filled with transcendental bliss. Those who neglect the quality of mercy, being uninterested in the missionary activities of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, are not filled with transcendental pleasure as described here by the word p\u016bryate. Not being filled with spiritual pleasure, surely such persons attempt to fill their lives with material pleasure through sense gratification and mental speculation, associating with women or reading innumerable mundane novels, newspapers, newsmagazines, and so on. According to \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu the preaching activities of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement are \u0101nand\u0101mbudhi-vardhanam, the ever-increasing ocean of bliss. Missionary activities are based on the principle of day\u0101m, or mercy to those who are fallen. Those who are actually preaching become enlivened by associating with other preachers. This principle is called maitr\u012bm, or friendship among equals. The power to carry out such preaching activities, as well as the proper guidance for distributing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s message, comes through the principle of pra\u015brayam, or humble service at the lotus feet of spiritual authorities such as the spiritual master. If one preaches K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness sincerely under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master and in the company of fellow preachers, one is perfectly fulfilling the statement of this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and thus he will come to the point of sarvato manaso\u00a0\u2019sa\u1e45gam, or complete detachment from the illusory energy of the Lord. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has stated, lava-m\u0101tra s\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45ge sarva-siddhi haya. By becoming attached to the devotees of the Lord, one will achieve all perfection in life, going back home, back to Godhead. If one neglects the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by engaging in sinful life, he is certainly not merciful. One who ignores his eternal status as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and who instead covers himself more and more with material illusions in the form of temporary designations \u2014 \u201cI am American,\u201d \u201cI am Russian,\u201d \u201cI am Indian,\u201d \u201cI am black,\u201d \u201cI am white\u201d and so on \u2014 is certainly a killer of his own soul and cannot be considered merciful. Similarly, those who support animal slaughter by eating meat, fish and eggs cannot be considered merciful. Sometimes the argument is given that if one does not harm others he is perfectly religious. But because we are now in a state of ignorance, we have no idea whatsoever of the future reactions to our present activities. Ignorantly boasting that one is not harming others, without an awareness of the subtle laws of nature, does not make one a religious person. One becomes religious by surrendering to the laws of God as they are stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As long as a living entity is infatuated with his own mental speculations, which carry him away like the waves of the ocean, he cannot understand the process of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mental speculations based on our experience of the variegated creations of the Lord\u2019s illusory energy are incapable of bringing us to perfect knowledge. One must give up materialistic association and make company with pure devotees of the Lord, those who are engaged twenty-four hours a day in perfectly pleasing the Supreme Lord. One should cultivate association with those who are more advanced than oneself in devotional service. One\u2019s advancement can be measured by one\u2019s detachment from sense gratification and his ability to distribute K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to others. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has said, ch\u0101\u1e0diy\u0101 vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-sev\u0101, nist\u0101ra p\u0101yeche keb\u0101: \u201cWho can attain salvation if he gives up the service of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas?\u201d By serving the lotus feet of pure devotees, one is immediately enlightened with spiritual knowledge. All of the so-called pleasures of the material world, culminating in many varieties of sexual fantasy and impersonal visions of oneself as God, become useless to one who has achieved the mercy of the lotus feet of a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The entire material creation is compared to an insignificant bubble in the ocean. The material universe rests on the spiritual potency of the Lord called brahmajyoti, just as an insignificant bubble rests on the potency of the unlimited ocean. By serving the lotus feet of a pure devotee one can enter the ocean of eternal happiness and experience his constitutional position as a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The mercy of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas is unlimited, and one who has tasted that mercy becomes mad after the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not caring for the hallucinations of so-called material pleasure or mental speculation. The mercy of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas is substantial and as powerful as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, whereas impersonal speculations and hopeless dreams of society, friendship and love merely constitute various means by which m\u0101y\u0101 cheats the conditioned souls and keeps them in perpetual frustration."

        "purport": " \u015aaucam, or \u201ccleanliness,\u201d refers to both internal and external purity. One should remain externally clean by bathing with soap and water at least once and, if possible, three times daily. One is considered internally pure when he is free from the pollution of false pride and egotism. Tapa\u1e25, or \u201causterity,\u201d means that despite the irrational impulses of the mind one should remain fixed in executing his proper duty in life. Specifically, one must control burning anger and the urge for wanton sex life. If a human being does not control the impulses of lust, anger and greed, he loses his power to understand his actual situation. Human life is a golden opportunity to solve the overwhelming problems of birth, death, old age and disease. According to the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (3.8.9): Every human being can achieve spiritual perfection by dedicating the fruits of his prescribed work to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.45) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly states, sve sve karma\u1e47y abhirata\u1e25 sa\u1e41siddhi\u1e41 labhate nara\u1e25. One does not have to adopt a monastic life or live in the forest as a yog\u012b; one can achieve perfection by dedicating his occupational duties to the Supreme Lord. Similarly, Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has said, n\u0101m\u0101\u015braya kari\u2019 yatane tumi, thakaha \u0101pana k\u0101je. If one sincerely takes shelter of the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, he will achieve spiritual perfection within the compass of his normal daily activities. Unfortunately, if a human being neglects the regulative principles of civilized life that prohibit illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling, he will surely be overwhelmed by the waves of lust and anger, which completely cover one\u2019s consciousness of the reality of spiritual life and draw one to engage in the phantasmagoria of the temporary material body. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.39): \u201cThus a man\u2019s pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire.\u201d Therefore, the word tapa\u1e25, or \u201causterity,\u201d in this verse indicates that one must remain in his prescribed duty and not become impatient or unregulated due to the waves of lust, anger and greed. The word titik\u1e63\u0101m, or \u201ctolerance,\u201d indicates that a transcendentalist must be forgiving. The material world is full of embarrassing and irritating situations, and unless one is inclined to be very much forgiving he will become infected by a vindictive mentality, which spoils one\u2019s spiritual consciousness. Maunam, or \u201csilence,\u201d means that one should not speak on worthless or frivolous topics, but should discuss the actual issues of human life such as going back home, back to Godhead. Remaining completely silent is a symptom of ignorance; a stone is silent due to a lack of consciousness. Since every material thing has its spiritual counterpart, the Vedic \u015b\u0101stras contain negative and positive injunctions. Corresponding to the negative injunction against speech is the positive injunction that one should always speak about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Satata\u1e41 k\u012brtayanto m\u0101m. One should always speak about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, glorifying His holy name, fame, pastimes, entourage, and so on. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also it is stated, \u015brotavya\u1e25 k\u012brtitavya\u015b ca dhyeya\u1e25 p\u016bjya\u015b ca nityad\u0101. One should always hear about, glorify, meditate upon and worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the verse 21 of this chapter it was stated, \u015b\u0101bde pare ca ni\u1e63\u1e47\u0101tam. The bona fide spiritual master is expert in \u015b\u0101bde pare, or the transcendental sound vibration describing the spiritual world. One cannot artificially remain empty-headed or speechless, as advocated by foolish proponents of concocted systems of meditation and yoga. But one should be so absorbed in the loving service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and so lovingly attracted to praising K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that one has not a single moment free to speak nonsense. That is the purport of the word maunam. Sv\u0101dhy\u0101yam means that one should study Vedic literature according to his individual ability and also teach others. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is mentioned that a br\u0101hma\u1e47a should have the qualities of j\u00f1\u0101na and vij\u00f1\u0101na, scriptural knowledge and practical realized application of knowledge. Specifically one should study those books which increase one\u2019s desire to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His Divine Grace O\u1e41 Vi\u1e63\u1e47up\u0101da Paramaha\u1e41sa Parivr\u0101jak\u0101c\u0101rya A\u1e63\u1e6dottara-\u015bata \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bmad Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da has written in a few short years a veritable library of transcendental knowledge. It is being practically seen throughout the world that when the principle of sv\u0101dhy\u0101yam, or Vedic study, is applied to these books, such as \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is, Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta and The Nectar of Devotion, the sincere reader becomes infused with the ecstatic determination to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The entire International Society for Krishna Consciousness is expanding all over the world on the basis of this transcendental literature. Sv\u0101dhy\u0101yam does not indicate speculative or imaginary interpretations of religious scriptures, nor should one try to read many books to increase his false prestige as a so-called scholar. One should read those books which inspire practical spiritual advancement in knowledge and renunciation, as exemplified by the books of \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da. The word \u0101rjavam indicates simplicity or straightforwardness. According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b svacchat\u0101m, or \u201cclarity, transparency,\u201d is a synonym for straightforwardness. Unless one is pure in consciousness he will adopt many crooked means. Straightforwardness does not indicate that one should insult others in the name of honesty, but that one should speak the humble truth. The word brahmacaryam, or \u201ccelibacy,\u201d indicates either renouncing completely the association of women or following strictly the Vedic principles of householder life, which regulate sex life for the purpose of procreating saintly children. Ahi\u1e41s\u0101m indicates that one should not commit violence against any living entity. Unless one is aware of the subtle laws of karma, by which a living being enjoys and suffers, one cannot actually practice ahi\u1e41s\u0101, or nonviolence. Ultimately the material world is full of violence, and the laws of nature, which impose old age, disease and death upon every living creature, are themselves filled with violence. Therefore, if somehow or other one can convince others to surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thus release themselves from the violent laws of material nature, that is the perfection of ahi\u1e41s\u0101. Samatva\u1e41 dvandva-sa\u1e41j\u00f1ayo\u1e25 indicates that one should keep a cool head even when disturbing material dualities become manifest. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14): \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\u201d"

        "translation": "One should practice meditation by constantly seeing oneself to be an eternal cognizant spirit soul and seeing the Lord to be the absolute controller of everything. To increase one\u2019s meditation, one should live in a secluded place and give up false attachment to one\u2019s home and household paraphernalia. Giving up the decorations of the temporary material body, one should dress himself with scraps of cloth found in rejected places, or with the bark of trees. In this way one should learn to be satisfied in any material situation.",
        "purport": " Kaivalyam, or living in a secluded place, indicates a place free from material disturbances. Therefore, one should live in the association of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, where the common goal is advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Especially in the Kali-yuga, if one tries to remain physically isolated from all others the result will be degradation or insanity. Aniketat\u0101m means that one should not be intoxicated by the ephemeral satisfaction of one\u2019s \u201chome sweet home,\u201d which will vanish at any moment by the unforeseen circumstances produced by one\u2019s previous activities. In this age it is not actually possible to dress in tree bark in modern cities, nor to wear mere scraps of cloth. Previously, human culture accommodated those practicing tapasya, or penances in the interest of spiritual advancement. In this age, however, the most urgent necessity is for preaching the message of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 throughout human society. Therefore, it is recommended that Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas dress with clean and neat cloth, covering the body decently so that the conditioned souls will not be frightened or repulsed by the severe penances of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. In the Kali-yuga the conditioned souls are extremely attached to material sense gratification, and extreme austerities are not appreciated, but are instead considered abominable denials of the flesh. Of course, austerity is required for spiritual advancement, but the practical example set by \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da in successfully spreading the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement was that all material things should be used to attract people to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas may at times adopt ordinary dress to serve the higher principle of distributing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In any case, one should learn to be satisfied in any material situation so as to prepare for the moment of death. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, at the time of death the particular consciousness we have created in this life will carry us to our future situation. Therefore, human life can be seen as a type of practice for successfully fixing one\u2019s mind on the Absolute Truth during the severe trials of death."

        "translation": "One should have firm faith that he will achieve all success in life by following those scriptures that describe the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagav\u0101n. At the same time, one should avoid blaspheming other scriptures. One should rigidly control his mind, speech and bodily activities, always speak the truth, and bring the mind and senses under full control.",
        "purport": " The definition of \u015braddh\u0101, or faith, is given as follows in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.62): \u201cBy rendering transcendental loving service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one automatically performs all subsidiary activities. This confident, firm faith, favorable to the discharge of devotional service, is called \u015braddh\u0101.\u201d Thus a devotee should be confident that by carrying out the injunctions of bh\u0101gavata-\u015b\u0101stra, or Vedic literature that directly, rather than indirectly, describes devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one will easily achieve all knowledge and the perfection of life. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, mano-v\u0101k-k\u0101ya-da\u1e47\u1e0dam, or strict control of the mind, speech and bodily activities, means m\u0101nasa-v\u0101cika-k\u0101yika-vikarma-r\u0101hityam; that is, one should rigidly abandon all sinful activities with his mind, speech and body. As \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has repeatedly pointed out, sense control does not mean stopping sensory activities, thus becoming like a dead body, but rather engaging one\u2019s mental, vocal and bodily activities in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated: \u201cA person acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person, even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.187) Thus one can achieve vikarma-r\u0101hityam, or freedom from unauthorized, sinful activities, by engaging one\u2019s senses, mind, intelligence and speech twenty-four hours daily in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that only those pious living entities who are vikarma-rahita, completely free from sinful life, can achieve freedom from the illusory duality of material nature (samatva\u1e41 dvandva-sa\u1e41j\u00f1ayo\u1e25). The Lord says: \u201cPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion engage themselves in My service with determination.\u201d (Bg. 7.28) In his purport to this verse, His Divine Grace \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has stated, \u201cThose eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are mentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion, who have acted piously and have conquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritual platform. This elevation is possible in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the association of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted the following statement from the Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cOne should have complete faith in transcendental literature such as \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and other literature that directly glorifies the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should also have faith in Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava tantras, the original Vedas, and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, which includes Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and which is considered the fifth Veda. The Vedic knowledge originally emanated from the breathing of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and Vedic literature has been compiled in literary form by \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva, the incarnation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u should be understood to be the personal speaker of all this Vedic literature. \u201cThere are other Vedic literatures, called kal\u0101-vidy\u0101, which give instructions in material arts and sciences. Since all such Vedic arts and sciences are ultimately intended to be used to render devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Ke\u015bava, saintly persons in the renounced order of life should never blaspheme such apparently mundane literatures; because such literatures are indirectly connected with the Supreme Lord, one may go to hell for blaspheming these secondary literatures. \u201c\u015araddh\u0101 indicates a faithful mentality, which can be analyzed in two sections. The first type of faith is a firm conviction that all the statements of the multifarious Vedic literatures are true. In other words, the understanding that Vedic knowledge in general is infallible is called \u015braddh\u0101, or faith. A second type of faith is the belief that one must personally carry out a particular injunction of Vedic literature in order to achieve his goal in life. A devotee of the Supreme Lord should thus apply the first type of faith to the various kal\u0101-vidy\u0101s, or Vedic material arts and sciences, but he should not accept such scriptures as pointing out his personal goal in life. Nor should he carry out any Vedic injunction that is contradictory to the injunctions of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava scriptures such as the Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra. \u201cThus one should faithfully accept all Vedic literature as directly or indirectly describing the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should not blaspheme any portion of it. Even for Lord Brahm\u0101, as well as for other creatures, down to the insignificant unmoving species such as trees and stones, blasphemy of any Vedic literature causes one to merge into the darkness of ignorance. Thus the suras \u2014 the demigods, great sages and devotees of the Lord \u2014 should understand that the Pa\u00f1car\u0101tric literatures, as well as the four Vedas, the original R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and other Pur\u0101\u1e47as, and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, are Vedic literatures that establish the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the unique transcendental position of the Lord\u2019s devotees according to their status of spiritual advancement. Any other vision of Vedic literatures is to be considered an illusion. In all authorized religious scriptures the ultimate goal is to understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the controller of everything and everyone, and that the Lord\u2019s devotees are not different from Him, although such devotees are to be understood in terms of their level of spiritual advancement.\u201d Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedyo/ ved\u0101nta-k\u1e5bd veda-vid eva c\u0101ham: \u201cBy all the Vedas, I am to be known; indeed, I am the compiler of Ved\u0101nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.\u201d Similarly, the Lord states: \u201cBecause I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as the Supreme Person.\u201d (Bg. 15.18) \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura mentions that one cannot develop the godly qualities mentioned in the preceding verses unless one accepts the shelter of the lotus feet of a bona fide Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava spiritual master. Tasm\u0101d guru\u1e41 prapadyeta jij\u00f1\u0101su\u1e25 \u015breya uttamam. In this connection, he has quoted the following statement: \u201cOne who performs worship of Lord Govinda but fails to worship His devotees should be understood to be not a devotee of the Lord but simply a victim of false pride.\u201d For one who has accepted shelter at the lotus feet of a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is very easy to execute worship of the Lord Himself. For such a surrendered soul there is no need of artificial penances and austerities. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has quoted the following (from N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra): \u201cIf one is worshiping Lord Hari, what is the use of performing extraneous penances? And if one is not worshiping Lord Hari, no such penances will save one. If one can understand that Lord Hari is all-pervading, within and without, what is the need of performing penances? And if one is not able to understand that Hari is all-pervading, all his penances are useless.\u201d A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always absorbed in executing his devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If a devotee becomes falsely proud of executing severe penances and austerities and meditates on accepting and rejecting material objects instead of thinking of his service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his so-called austerities become an impediment to devotional service. A devotee should not be disturbed by the word jugglery of those who are against the devotional service of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has emphatically pointed out that devotional service to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord is the only means of achieving the final perfection of life. Therefore a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should practice maunam, or silence, by ignoring those literatures which are full of false arguments, such as those of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da school, and those karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da scriptures which promote sense gratification in the name of religious life. If one becomes overwhelmed by mundane unhappiness due to not achieving immediate success in self-realization, or if one becomes deluded by sense gratification and tries to take shelter of materialistic men and doctrines, one\u2019s devotional progress will immediately be checked. Similarly, if a devotee expresses love for things separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or tries to find fault in the process of devotional service or the philosophy of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in order to justify absorbing himself in the sense gratification of seeing things separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his progress in spiritual enlightenment will be seriously disturbed. Such an illusory concept is called dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015ba, or absorption in illusion. On the other hand, if one is attracted to the vibration of Vedic sound by the consensus of self-realized authorities called the vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-parampar\u0101 and thus engages enthusiastically in k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101ma-k\u012brtana, or chanting the holy names of the Lord, then one\u2019s practice of mauna, or silence, is perfect. One should avoid prajalpa, or whimsical conversations unrelated to devotional service. Merely restraining the senses artificially without chanting and hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord cannot be considered the spiritual perfection. The example is given that although many domestic animals in the barnyard are sometimes forced to practice celibacy when isolated from one another, such animals cannot be considered brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, or spiritual students. Similarly, one is not considered spiritually advanced simply because of dry speculative arguments or temporary austerities. One must submissively hear the message of the Vedic sound vibration, especially as it is summarized in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the Lord Himself. Vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has warned us that if one becomes attracted to nontheistic ethical philosophies, such as those of the Buddhists and Jains, which glorify such mundane principles as ahi\u1e41s\u0101, or nonviolence, one\u2019s mundane faith in godless ethics is spiritually suicidal. To restrict the senses by artificial austerities and to undertake huge social arrangements to facilitate mass sense gratification are both godless attempts to regulate human society in an artificial way that hides the eternal relationship of every living being with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the natural leader of society. When so-called moral philosophers spoil the opportunity of human life, the opportunity to revive our eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the name of ethics such foolish persons commit the greatest violence against human society. Therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja Gosv\u0101m\u012b has said: \u201cIf you are indeed interested in logic and argument, kindly apply them to the mercy of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. If you do so, you will find such mercy strikingly wonderful.\u201d (Cc. \u0100di 8.15) According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, or pure devotee of the Lord, is one who sees that both the material and spiritual worlds are nondifferent from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being expansions of His potency, but also sees that Vrajendranandana, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, keeps Himself eternally distinct by His unique quality of all-attractiveness. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord is aniketana, without a fixed residence, meaning that he accepts neither the gross nor subtle body as his eternal residence. Since one\u2019s so-called home and family are expansions of his body, such material creations are also not to be considered one\u2019s actual residence. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said: \u201cO K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda, I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death. Please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet.\u201d (\u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka 5) Thus a devotee should understand that his eternal residence is fixed in the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should reject the gross sense gratification of living in the forest in the mode of goodness, in the city in the mode of passion, or in the gambling house in ignorance. A pure devotee may travel all over the world distributing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but he should never consider any material place to be his actual residence. One who has become mature in this understanding may take the trida\u1e47\u1e0da-sanny\u0101sa order of life under the direct shelter of the Lord. The impersonalist cannot understand how the devotee of the Lord, although fixed in the duality of seeing himself as eternally different from the Lord, sees all existence as nondifferent from the Lord. Those who attempt to acquire knowledge by impersonal speculation based on their tiny experience of the material cosmic manifestation cannot understand the transcendental reality of acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva, the Absolute Truth\u2019s simultaneous oneness with and difference from His creation. The process of assimilating this transcendental knowledge is given in these verses, starting with tasm\u0101d guru\u1e41 prapadyeta. One is recommended to accept a bona fide spiritual master and serve him according to the direction of these verses. The essence of such instructions is that one should abandon the association of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b impersonalists, ritualistic fruitive workers and those who are whimsically indifferent to the ultimate purpose of life, and instead one should devote himself to associating with the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A falsely proud neophyte may imagine himself a great devotee of the Lord without taking to the company of the Lord\u2019s followers, but without such association it is not possible to become advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

One should specifically become absorbed in the appearance, activities, qualities and holy names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus inspired, one should perform all of one\u2019s daily activities as an offering to the Lord. One should perform sacrifice, charity and penance exclusively for the Lord\u2019s satisfaction. Similarly, one should chant only those mantras which glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And all one\u2019s religious activities should be performed as an offering to the Lord. Whatever one finds pleasing or enjoyable he should immediately offer to the Supreme Lord, and even his wife, children, home and very life air he should offer at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.27) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has ordered: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, and all austerities that you perform should be done as an offering unto Me.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has commented on this verse as follows: \u201cThus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in any circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends herein that one should work for Him. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends, \u2018Do it for Me,\u2019 and this is called arcanam. Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity; K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u2018Give it to Me,\u2019 and this means that all surplus money accumulated should be utilized in furthering the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra round his beads, he is surely the greatest yog\u012b, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\u201d Many persons who become attracted to the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are bewildered by the material possessions, reputation or skills they have accumulated by their previous material activities. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b these two verses indicate that all such material opulences accumulated by one\u2019s previous karma should be used as an offering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One\u2019s fame, education, wealth and so on should all be used to carry out the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes envious materialists ask why one should waste one\u2019s wealth and education in the Lord\u2019s service when such things could be better used to gratify the temporary material body. Actually, however, whatever we possess, including this body, is ultimately the property of the Supreme Lord, who is the creator, maintainer and annihilator of all existence. Therefore, one should be blessed by dovetailing one\u2019s so-called opulences in the devotional service of the Lord. Otherwise, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, m\u1e5btyu\u1e25 sarva-hara\u015b c\u0101ham: the Supreme Lord will appear before us at the time of death as m\u1e5btyu, death personified, and violently take away all of our possessions. Therefore, such possessions should be peacefully offered to the lotus feet of the Lord while we are still living and able to enjoy the pious result of such an offering. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, tapa\u1e25, austerity, means that one should observe vows such as Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b-vrata, in which one fasts from grains and beans twice a month. The word japtam refers to chanting the holy names of the Lord, such as Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has further pointed out that one can offer one\u2019s wife, children and home to the Lord by converting one\u2019s family into devotees of the Supreme Lord. Rather than becoming artificially puffed up in the pursuit of so-called status symbols, one\u2019s family should be trained to understand that they are eternal servants of the Supreme Lord. And when the entire family becomes dedicated to the Lord\u2019s service, a very beautiful situation is created. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that if a human being is not initiated into the process of bh\u0101gavata-dharma he must depend upon the uncertain knowledge derived from his gross material senses. Indifferent to the sublime descriptions of the Lord\u2019s eternal appearances, pastimes and innumerable transcendental qualities, the faithless materialist wanders about on the platform of mundane enjoyment. But if one can understand the reality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is described in authorized Vedic literature, then one should accept the order of trida\u1e47\u1e0da-sanny\u0101sa, or at least one should practice restraint of the body, mind and words and thus become self-controlled and fixed in the Absolute Truth. Then all of one\u2019s desires, all the charity he gives, and his penances and chanting of mantras \u2014 in other words, his entire personality, his home, his children, his wife and his very life air \u2014 become heartfelt offerings to the Supreme Lord. When a living entity constantly hears the authorized descriptions of the Supreme Lord and dovetails all of his activities in the Lord\u2019s service, avoiding other activities, he is considered to be fixed on the platform of bh\u0101gavata-dharma."

Thus they constantly remember the Lord and remind one another of His qualities and pastimes. In this way, by their devotion to the principles of bhakti-yoga, the devotees please the Personality of Godhead, who takes away from them everything inauspicious. Being purified of all impediments, the devotees awaken to pure love of Godhead, and thus, even within this world, their spiritualized bodies exhibit symptoms of transcendental ecstasy, such as standing of the bodily hairs on end.",
        "purport": " The word aghaugha-haram is very significant in this verse. Agha refers to that which is inauspicious or sinful. The living entity is actually sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, or eternal and full of bliss and knowledge, but by neglecting his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, he commits sinful activities and undergoes the inauspicious result in the form of material suffering. The chain of sinful reactions is called ogha, or a relentless wave of suffering. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is aghaugha-hara\u1e41 harim; He takes away the sinful reactions of His devotees, who are thus entitled to experience the inconceivable bliss of the kingdom of God even while remaining in this world. The words bhakty\u0101 sa\u00f1j\u0101tay\u0101 bhakty\u0101 indicate that there are two divisions of bhakti-yoga: s\u0101dhana-bhakti and r\u0101g\u0101nuga-bhakti. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has elaborately explained in his book The Nectar of Devotion the progress of the devotee from s\u0101dhana-bhakti, or the execution of regulative principles, to r\u0101g\u0101nuga-bhakti, or service executed in love of Godhead. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a liberated soul is always enthusiastic due to the appearance of transcendental ecstasy within his body. Thus he always aspires to remain overwhelmed in chanting the glories of the Personality of Godhead, Hari."

Everyone has the opportunity to come to this platform of transcendental bliss by taking the dust of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s representative on his head. One should give up the mentality of envy and false prestige and humbly take shelter of the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, in the previous verse the sages informed the King, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-paro m\u0101y\u0101m a\u00f1jas tarati dustar\u0101m: simply by unalloyed devotion to Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, one can very easily cross over the ocean of material illusion. Therefore, in this verse the King is requesting specific information about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. It is significant in this verse that the King refers to the Supreme Lord as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. Although King Nimi is already understood to be a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by his question he wants to clarify that the Personality of Godhead is the highest transcendental truth. In the Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.11): \u201cLearned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 or Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d Therefore it is to be understood that the word n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in this verse refers to the Bhagav\u0101n feature of the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world. Generally the speculative philosophers become attracted to the impersonal Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth, whereas the mystic yog\u012bs meditate upon the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supersoul within everyone\u2019s heart. On the other hand, those who have achieved mature transcendental knowledge surrender directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagav\u0101n, who is eternally situated in His own abode, called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-dh\u0101ma. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says, brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham: \u201cI am the source of the impersonal Brahman.\u201d Similarly, it is described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that the Supersoul, K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is a secondary plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. King Nimi wants the sages to make clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original feature of the Absolute Truth, and therefore he places his question before the next of the nine Yogendras, Pippal\u0101yana. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura the word ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 can also be translated as \u201cfirm faith.\u201d In this sense, Nimi Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is inquiring about the process of developing perfect faith in the Supreme Lord (bhagavan-ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101)."

        "translation": "\u015ar\u012b Pippal\u0101yana said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction of this universe, yet He has no prior cause. He pervades the various states of wakefulness, dreaming and unconscious deep sleep and also exists beyond them. By entering the body of every living being as the Supersoul, He enlivens the body, senses, life airs and mental activities, and thus all the subtle and gross organs of the body begin their functions. My dear King, know that Personality of Godhead to be the Supreme.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse King Nimi inquired about various aspects of the Absolute Truth, namely N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. Now the sage \u015ar\u012b Pippal\u0101yana explains these three features of the Absolute Truth in the same order in which the King mentioned them. Sthity-udbhava-pralaya-hetu\u1e25 refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who expands Himself as the triple puru\u1e63a incarnations \u2014 Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. As described in the Bh\u0101gavatam (1.3.1): \u201cIn the beginning of the creation, the Lord first expanded Himself in the universal form of the puru\u1e63a incarnation and manifested all the ingredients for the material creation. And thus at first there was the creation of the sixteen principles of material action. This was for the purpose of creating the material universe.\u201d Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, is mentioned here as hetu\u1e25, or the supreme cause of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the cosmic situation. Still, there is no cause of the Lord Himself; He is ahetu\u1e25. As expressed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am. The Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, and being the eternal Absolute Truth, He has no cause of Himself. The word ahetu\u1e25 has also been explained by \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b to indicate that the Supreme Lord has His original form as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His own transcendental abode, called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always engaged in His blissful pastimes in the company of His eternally liberated associates, He is aloof from the affairs of this world, which is created by His external potency, known as m\u0101y\u0101. Therefore it is stated, jag\u1e5bhe pauru\u1e63a\u1e41 r\u016bpam. The Lord expands Himself as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to facilitate the gross illusion and gradual rectification of the conditioned souls. The Lord\u2019s aloofness from the material creation is also described in the Vedas: na tasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 kara\u1e47a\u1e41 ca vidyate. The Absolute Truth has nothing to do, since everything is done self-sufficiently by His multipotencies. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that even though the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ahetu\u1e25, or causeless and aloof from the cause of material creation, the Lord is also described in this verse as hetu\u1e25, or the ultimate cause of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material manifestation, because He expands Himself as Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supersoul, who acts as the prime mover of the cosmic manifestation. The word ahetu\u1e25 may also be understood in another way. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.5) the Lord says: The conditioned living entities (j\u012bva-bh\u016bta) desire to engage in sense gratification with their material senses (mana\u1e25-\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u012bndriy\u0101\u1e47i prak\u1e5bti-sth\u0101ni kar\u1e63ati). Thus the creation of the material world becomes necessary. In fact, the material cosmic manifestation continues to exist because of the desires of the conditioned souls to exploit it (yayeda\u1e41 dh\u0101ryate jagat). The government must create a prison to accommodate those citizens who are inclined to criminal activity. There is no need for any citizen to live in the obnoxious conditions of the prison, but because a certain portion of the population is inclined toward antisocial behavior, the prison becomes necessary. In a higher sense, the prisoners themselves can be considered the hetu\u1e25, or the cause, for the construction of the prison. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands His internal potency according to His own desire to increase the \u0101nanda, or transcendental bliss, of Himself and His pure devotees, but He manifests the material universe in response to the illicit desires of the conditioned souls to live a life of sense gratification in willful forgetfulness of Him. Therefore the conditioned living entities themselves can be considered the hetu\u1e25, or cause, of the material manifestation. The external potency of the Lord, m\u0101y\u0101, who is charged with the duty of material manifestation, is called ch\u0101y\u0101, or the shadow of the Lord\u2019s internal potency. S\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di-sthiti-pralaya-s\u0101dhana-\u015baktir ek\u0101/ ch\u0101yeva yasya bhuvan\u0101ni bibharti durg\u0101. The Lord does not personally desire to manifest the shadow potency, called Durg\u0101 or m\u0101y\u0101. The blissful spiritual planets, eternally manifest, contain the best possible facilities for the living entities who are parts and parcels of the Lord. But the conditioned souls, rejecting the inconceivable, eternal living arrangements the Lord has kindly provided, prefer to seek their misfortune in the shadow kingdom called the material world. Thus, both Durg\u0101 and the conditioned living entities may be considered the hetu\u1e25, or cause, of the material manifestation. Since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ultimately sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am, the cause of all causes, He is to be known as the ultimate supreme cause. But how the Lord functions as the supreme cause of the material manifestation (sthity-udbhava-pralaya-hetu\u1e25) is described in the Thirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Upadra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101numant\u0101 ca: the Lord acts as overseer and permitter. The actual desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is stated very clearly in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. The Lord desires every living entity to give up the shadow potency m\u0101y\u0101 and return to the actual substance (v\u0101stava\u1e41 vastu), which is the eternal kingdom of God. Although various aspects of the Absolute Truth are being described, the Absolute Truth is ultimately one, as stated in this verse (tad avehi para\u1e41 narendra). King Nimi inquired about Brahman, and now this verse says, yat svapna-j\u0101gara-su\u1e63upti\u1e63u sad bahi\u015b ca. The Lord\u2019s all-pervading feature within wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, and His existence beyond these three mental states, are understood to be manifestations of Brahman, the spiritual potency of the Lord. Finally, the statement dehendriy\u0101su-h\u1e5bday\u0101\u1e47i caranti yena sa\u00f1j\u012bvit\u0101ni can be understood to refer to the Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature of the Lord. When the Lord expands Himself as K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the third of the three Vi\u1e63\u1e47u features, and enters the heart of every living entity, the gross and subtle organs of the body become enlivened for continuing the chain of fruitive activity called karma. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the multifarious manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not compromise His supremacy as one without a second. The Absolute Truth is paramavyoma-n\u0101tha, or the Lord of the spiritual sky, who appears as two-armed \u015ay\u0101masundara, as four-armed, as eight-armed or as having one thousand arms. In each aspect His body is eternal and full of bliss and knowledge (sac-cid-\u0101nanda-m\u016brti). He appears on earth as V\u0101sudeva and within the Causal Ocean as Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. He lies on the Milk Ocean as K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and rescues His helpless young devotee as N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva. Appearing as Lord R\u0101macandra, He acts as a perfect king. And appearing as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a He steals the heart of everyone, and especially of young beautiful women. All these features of the Lord are indicated by the word N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the word president indicates not only the official duties of the president but his personal family life and long intimate friendships as well. According to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam. When one transcends an official understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes to the superior status of love of God, one can understand the Lord to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the cause of all causes. The innumerable Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions of the Lord are also understood to be plenary portions of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam. As the Lord Himself states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25. These points have been explicitly clarified in the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as well as in the opening verse, o\u1e41 namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya, janm\u0101dy asya yato\u00a0\u2019nvay\u0101d itarata\u015b c\u0101rthe\u1e63u."

        "translation": "Neither the mind nor the faculties of speech, sight, intelligence, the life air or any of the senses are capable of penetrating that Supreme Truth, any more than small sparks can affect the original fire from which they are generated. Not even the authoritative language of the Vedas can perfectly describe the Supreme Truth, since the Vedas themselves disclaim the possibility that the Truth can be expressed by words. But through indirect reference the Vedic sound does serve as evidence of the Supreme Truth, since without the existence of that Supreme Truth the various restrictions found in the Vedas would have no ultimate purpose.",
        "purport": " The small sparks generated by a blazing fire have no power to illuminate the original fire, nor can they burn it. The quantity of heat and light in the original fire is always superior to the quantity found in the insignificant sparks. Similarly, the minute living entity is generated from the internal potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25) and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25, mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25). The minute living entities, being a\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25, or sparks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can never equal the Supreme Godhead in the quantity of their potency. The quantity of knowledge and bliss in the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always superior. Therefore, when a foolish conditioned soul tries to illuminate the subject matter of the highest truth with his tiny brain, he merely illuminates his own foolishness. The Personality of Godhead has personally spoken Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which is the blazing fire of perfect knowledge that burns to ashes the insignificant speculations and theories of so-called philosophers and scientists regarding the ultimate truth. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, or the Lord of everyone\u2019s senses. Because the Personality of Godhead has supreme seeing power, hearing power, touching power, smelling power and tasting power, the living entities in a limited sense can also see, hear, touch, smell and taste, by the mercy of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba. This idea is expressed in the B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (4.4.18): pr\u0101\u1e47asya pr\u0101\u1e47am uta cak\u1e63u\u1e63a\u015b cak\u1e63ur uta \u015brotrasya \u015brotram annasy\u0101nna\u1e41 manaso ye mano vidu\u1e25. \u201cThe Supreme Truth is understood to be the life air sustaining everyone\u2019s life air, the vision of everyone\u2019s eyes, the hearing power of the ear, and the sustenance of food itself.\u201d The obvious conclusion is that the Supreme Truth can be known by His own causeless mercy, and not by our foolish attempts to bring the all-pervading truth within the insignificant boundaries of our intelligence. It is stated in the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.4.1), yato v\u0101co nivartante apr\u0101pya manas\u0101 saha: \u201cThe descriptive power of speech fails in the realm of the Supreme Truth, and the speculative power of the mind cannot achieve Him.\u201d But because such statements of Vedic \u015brutis are in themselves descriptions of the Absolute Truth, one may consider such Vedic statements contradictory. Therefore, in this connection it is stated, \u015babdo\u00a0\u2019pi bodhaka-ni\u1e63edhatay\u0101tma-m\u016blam arthoktam \u0101ha: although the Vedic \u015bruti (\u015babda) forbids us to speculate upon the Absolute Truth, such restrictive injunctions indirectly constitute positive assertions of the existence of the supreme living entity. In fact, the Vedic restrictions are meant to save one from the false path of mental speculation and ultimately bring one to the point of devotional surrender. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: by all Vedic literatures the Supreme Personality of Godhead is to be known. The assertion that a particular process, such as mental speculation, is useless (yato v\u0101co nivartante apr\u0101pya manas\u0101 saha) constitutes an indirect assertion of the existence of a correct path of achieving the Supreme. As \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has stated, sarvasya ni\u1e63edhasya s\u0101vadhitv\u0101t: \u201cEvery negative injunction is understood to have a specific limit. Negative injunctions cannot be taken as applicable in all cases.\u201d For example, a negative injunction is that no living entity can be equal to or greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam clearly states that because of the intense love of the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they sometimes assume a superior position. Thus mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 binds K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with ropes, and the influential cowherd boys sometimes ride on the shoulders of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or defeat Him in wrestling. Negative injunctions, therefore, may sometimes be adjusted according to the transcendental situation. Although the Absolute Truth is transcendental to the material creation and therefore beyond the scope of material senses, when those same material senses are saturated with love of Godhead they become spiritualized and empowered to perceive the Absolute Truth. As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38): \u201cI worship the primeval Lord, Govinda. who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of \u015ay\u0101masundara within the heart of the devotee.\u201d In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (11.8) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says to Arjuna, \u201cBut you cannot see Me with your present eyes. Therefore I give you divine eyes by which you can behold My mystic opulence.\u201d Similarly, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam describes many incidents in which the Supreme Absolute Truth revealed Himself to His devotee, as in the histories of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Kardama Muni, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the gop\u012bs. Therefore, the Vedic assertions that the Absolute Truth is beyond the power of the eyes refer to those who have not received transcendental eyes by the mercy of the Personality of Godhead. But the Lord\u2019s own transcendental senses, which are the source of our limited senses, are confirmed in the \u015bruti, as in the following statement from the Kena Upani\u1e63ad (1.4): yad v\u0101c\u0101nabhyudita\u1e41 yena v\u0101g abhyudyate/ tad eva brahma tva\u1e41 viddhi neda\u1e41 yad idam up\u0101sate. \u201cBrahman, the Absolute, should be understood to be that which cannot be ascertained by the material power of speech; speech itself is evinced by that Supreme Truth.\u201d By the statement yena v\u0101g abhyudyate, \u201cour power of speech is expressed by the Absolute Truth,\u201d it is clearly expressed that the Absolute Truth has His own transcendental senses. Therefore He is called H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba. \u015ar\u012bla N\u0101rada Muni has stated, h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bkena h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate. Our senses cannot approach the Absolute Truth by their own power, but when engaged in loving devotional service to satisfy the Lord of the senses, our limited senses must become connected with the Lord\u2019s unlimited senses, and thus by the Lord\u2019s mercy He can be understood. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted the following statement from the Brahma-tarka: \u201cThe transcendental bliss of the Absolute Truth cannot be compared to the ordinary happiness of the material world.\u201d Similarly, in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra the Absolute Truth is described as \u0101nandamaya, or full of bliss. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, in this verse \u015ar\u012b Pippal\u0101yana is more or less describing the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. The nine Yogendras were themselves devotees of the personal feature of the Lord, so King Nimi asked his question about the different features of the Absolute Truth to clarify that the Personality of Godhead is the source of all the variegated aspects of the advaya-j\u00f1\u0101na, or transcendental reality. This is also expressed by the following statement in \u015bruti: ta\u1e41 tv aupani\u1e63ada\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 p\u1e5bcch\u0101mi. \u201cI am inquiring about that Supreme Person revealed in the Upani\u1e63ads.\u201d If the Absolute Truth were actually inaccessible by words, there would be no meaning to the Vedic literature, which consists of collections of transcendental words. Since the Vedic descriptions of the truth are to be taken as infallible, it is impossible to maintain that the power of speech is in all cases unable to describe the truth. After all, the Vedic mantras themselves are meant to be spoken and heard. Therefore, the injunction that neither the mind nor speech can approach the Absolute Truth (naitan mano vi\u015bati v\u0101g uta) cannot be taken as applicable in all cases; rather, it is a warning to those who foolishly try to encompass the Absolute Truth by their own puny speculative powers. Since the Vedic injunctions, either positive or negative, are to be taken as realistic descriptions of the Absolute Truth, the process of hearing and repeating Vedic knowledge (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25) can be understood as a separate process in which one\u2019s hearing and speaking power becomes spiritualized by submissive reception of transcendental knowledge. This process depends upon one\u2019s faith in the bona fide spiritual master, who is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore it is stated: \u201cOnly unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23) As the Lord Himself states in the Hari-va\u1e41\u015ba: \u201cThat Supreme Truth, Parabrahman, expands itself into all the variegatedness of this universe. You should know it to be My own concentrated effulgence, O Bh\u0101rata.\u201d The words j\u00f1\u0101tum arhasi, \u201cyou must know it,\u201d spoken by the Lord Himself, indicate that the Absolute Truth is to be known, but one must surrender to the truth, rather than waste time in foolish speculation. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that according to authorized statements of Vedic literature the Lord\u2019s transcendental form is understood to be brahmamaya, or completely spiritual, with no trace of material contamination. Therefore, in such statements as n\u012blotpala-dala-\u015by\u0101mam, \u201cthe Lord\u2019s form is beautifully manifest with the hue of dark blue lotus petals,\u201d it is understood that a transcendental dark blue color is being described. Still, the Lord is inconceivably merciful to His devotees, even those on the neophyte platform who are trying to come to the state of love of Godhead. Therefore the Lord gradually purifies the senses of a conditioned soul who is trying to understand Him, and eventually the Lord appears before such a rectified servitor. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, pr\u0101k\u1e5bta-n\u012blotpala-var\u1e47atvena bhaktair dhy\u0101tam at\u0101d\u1e5b\u015bam api. In the beginning, being conditioned by previous materialistic activities, a devotee meditating on the Lord\u2019s transcendental form may base his meditation on his experience of material forms and colors within this world. The Lord\u2019s transcendental form has nothing to do with material forms and colors, but since the object of this meditation is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, such meditation will eventually be transformed into transcendental experience of the actual form, color, activities, pastimes and entourage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, transcendental knowledge depends not on material logic but on the pleasure of the Personality of Godhead. If the Lord is pleased by His devotee\u2019s sincere attempt to understand Him, the Lord can immediately circumvent all the so-called technicalities of material logic and Vedic injunctions and reveal Himself to His pure devotee. Unless one accepts this omnipotency of the Personality of Godhead, there is no hope of approaching the Absolute Truth. Therefore it is stated in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (1.3.12), d\u1e5b\u015byate tv agryay\u0101 buddhy\u0101: the Absolute Truth is seen by transcendental intelligence. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that knowledge acquired through the interaction of the material senses with the modes of nature is merely hypothetical and not factual. Empirical knowledge deals with our ephemeral experience of the sense objects generated by material nature. For example, there are many wars currently going on because of a false concept of nationalism. Similarly, there is conflict throughout the world, and great world leaders fight like cats and dogs for the economic development of their countries. Thus, material language is used to designate temporary objects perceived by the eyes, nose, tongue, touch and taste. This type of language and experience is useless for approaching the Absolute Truth. But the transcendental sound from the spiritual sky has a completely different effect. We should not foolishly try to use materially concocted language to include the Supreme Personality of Godhead as an object of the material world. The Supreme Lord is completely transcendental and is known as \u0101tma-prak\u0101\u015ba, or self-manifested. Therefore, as stated in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cMaterial senses cannot appreciate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s holy name, form, qualities and pastimes. But when a conditioned soul is awakened to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and renders service by using his tongue to chant the Lord\u2019s holy name and taste the remnants of the Lord\u2019s food, the tongue is purified, and one gradually comes to understand who K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a really is.\u201d If one surrenders to the Supreme Lord, taking shelter at His lotus feet, one\u2019s spiritualized senses gradually become empowered to perceive the Lord. Mere empiricism and material logic have a limited jurisdiction within the external energy of the Supreme Lord and cannot apply to those things which are eternal. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has quoted the following verse from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (7.5.32): \u201cUnless they smear upon their bodies the dust of the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava completely freed from material contamination, persons very much inclined toward materialistic life cannot be attached to the lotus feet of the Lord, who is glorified for His uncommon activities. Only by becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and taking shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord in this way can one be freed from material contamination.\u201d Although \u015ar\u012b Pippal\u0101yana is expressing that the Absolute Truth cannot be approached by material senses, the sage himself is describing the Absolute Truth with transcendental senses, and King Nimi is able to understand this transcendental sound because he has surrendered at the lotus feet of pure devotees, the nava-yogendras. Therefore, one should not foolishly try to understand this verse out of context, in an impersonal way, but should follow the example of King Nimi, who was trying to understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead is ultimately the source of everything."

        "translation": "Originally one, the Absolute, Brahman, comes to be known as threefold, manifesting itself as the three modes of material nature \u2014 goodness, passion and ignorance. Brahman further expands its potency, and thus the power to act and the power of consciousness become manifest, along with the false ego, which covers the identity of the conditioned living being. Thus, by the expansion of the multipotencies of the Absolute, the demigods, as the embodiment of knowledge, become manifest, along with the material senses, their objects, and the results of material activity, namely happiness and distress. In this way the manifestation of the material world takes place as the subtle cause and as the material effect visible in the appearance of gross material objects. Brahman, which is the source of all subtle and gross manifestations, is simultaneously transcendental to them, being absolute.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse the sage Pippal\u0101yana described the Absolute, Brahman, as being beyond the range of material sense perception and mental speculation. At the same time, it was stated, \u0101tma-m\u016blam arthoktam \u0101ha yad-\u1e5bte na ni\u1e63edha-siddhi\u1e25: the negative injunctions of the Vedas indirectly indicate the existence of the Absolute Truth. This Absolute Truth can be approached by correct means. Now, in the present verse, it is clearly described that the Absolute Truth possesses innumerable potencies (uru-\u015bakti brahmaiva bh\u0101ti). Thus by the expansion of the Absolute Truth the gross and subtle features of the material world become manifest. As stated by \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, k\u0101rya\u1e41 k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101d bhinna\u1e41 na bhavati: \u201cThe result is not different from its cause.\u201d Therefore, since the Absolute is eternal existence, this material world, being the potency of the Absolute, must also be accepted as real, although the various manifestations of the material world are temporary and thus illusory. The material world should be understood to consist of the bewildering interactions of real elements. The material world is not false in the imaginary sense of the Buddhists and M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, who state that in fact the material world does not exist outside the mind of the observer. The material world, as the potency of the Absolute, has real existence. But the living entity becomes bewildered by the temporary manifestations, foolishly taking them to be permanent. Thus the material world functions as an illusory potency, causing the living entity to forget the spiritual world, wherein life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. Because the material world thus bewilders the conditioned soul, it is called illusory. When a magician performs his tricks onstage, that which the audience apparently sees is an illusion. But the magician actually exists, and the hat and rabbit exist, although the appearance of a rabbit coming out of a hat is an illusion. Similarly, when the living entity identifies himself as part and parcel of the material world, thinking, \u201cI am American,\u201d \u201cI am Indian,\u201d \u201cI am Russian,\u201d \u201cI am black,\u201d \u201cI am white,\u201d he is bewildered by the magic of the Lord\u2019s illusory potency. The conditioned soul must come to understand, \u201cI am a pure spirit soul, part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Now let me stop my useless activities and serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, since I am part of Him.\u201d Then he is free from the illusion of m\u0101y\u0101. If one artificially tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy by declaring that there is no illusory potency and that this world is false, he merely falls into another illusion created by m\u0101y\u0101 to keep him in ignorance. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): Unless one surrenders at the lotus feet of M\u0101ye\u015ba, the Lord of the illusory potency, there is no possibility of escaping from illusion. Childishly declaring that there is no illusory potency is useless, since m\u0101y\u0101 is duratyay\u0101, or insurpassable for the tiny living entity. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the omnipotent Personality of Godhead, can immediately call off the illusory potency. In this verse the expansion of the material world from Brahman, the Absolute, is described. Since Brahman is one of the subordinate features of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (brahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate), one who understands this material world to be Brahman is freed from the tendency to exploit the material energy through sense gratification and mental speculation aimed at one\u2019s own satisfaction. The question may be raised, Since Brahman is stated to be ekam, or one, how does it become manifest in the innumerable varieties of the material world? Therefore this verse uses the word uru-\u015bakti. The Absolute contains multipotencies, as stated in the Vedas (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad): par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate. The Absolute Truth is not \u015bakti, or energy, but \u015baktim\u0101n, the possessor of innumerable potencies. According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, one should submissively hear these authorized descriptions of the Absolute Truth. As stated in the previous verse, yath\u0101nalam arci\u1e63a\u1e25 sv\u0101\u1e25: the insignificant sparks of a fire have no power to illuminate the blazing fire, which is itself the source of illumination. Similarly, the tiny living entity, who is like a spark of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot illuminate the Personality of Godhead by his insignificant intellectual power. One may argue that the sun expands its potency in the form of its rays and it is through the illumination of those rays that we are able to see the sun. In the same way, we should be able to perceive the Absolute Truth by the expansion of its potency. In answer to this it may be stated that if the sun creates a cloud covering the sky, then despite the presence of sun rays the sun cannot be seen. Therefore, ultimately the power to see the sun depends not only on the sun\u2019s rays but on the presence of a clear sky, which is also an arrangement by the sun. Similarly, as stated in this verse, one can understand the existence of the Absolute Truth by the expansion of its potencies. Although in the previous verse the power of the material senses and mind was rejected, the authorized descriptions given here inform us that one can directly perceive everything that exists to be the potency of the Personality of Godhead. In this regard, N\u0101rada Muni advised King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi as follows: \u201cYou should always know that this cosmic manifestation is created, maintained and annihilated by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently, everything within this cosmic manifestation is under the control of the Lord. To be enlightened by this perfect knowledge, one should always engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 4.29.79) As stated here, bhaja sarv\u0101tman\u0101 harim: one must worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that one\u2019s consciousness will become clean and pure, just like the clear blue sky in which the potent sun is fully manifest. When one sees the sun, he immediately sees the sun\u2019s rays in full potency. Similarly, if one engages in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one\u2019s mind becomes cleansed of material dirt, and thus he can see not only the Lord but the Lord\u2019s expansions as the spiritual world, as the pure devotees, as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, as the impersonal Brahman effulgence and as the subsequent creation of the material world, the shadow of the kingdom of God (ch\u0101yeva), in which so many material varieties become manifest. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the word phalam can also be understood to mean puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-svar\u016bpam, or the actual form of the goal of life, or, in other words, the transcendental form of the Lord Himself. The living entity in his original pure state is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, the infinite multicolored opulence of the kingdom of God, called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, is nondifferent in quality from the Lord. Thus when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is personally present with His unparalleled opulence and His pure spiritual servitors, the living entities, a very happy situation is created. The mundane concept of family is a perverted reflection of the happy situation created when the Lord is united in full spiritual opulence with His pure devotees. Every living entity has the option to join the Lord in His opulent eternal kingdom. Thus one should understand from this verse that everything within the gross and subtle cosmic manifestations is the potency of the Lord and is therefore meant to be used in the Lord\u2019s service. \u012a\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has given an elaborate explanation proving that the entire cosmic situation is the natural potency of the Absolute Truth. Sometimes superstitious people, without knowledge of the Personality of Godhead, say that material activities are controlled by an independent devil and that God is struggling with such a devil. Such gross ignorance of the omnipotent status of the Personality of Godhead can be removed by understanding the purport of this verse. Just as a spark is a tiny emanation from a blazing fire, everything that exists is but an insignificant spark of the potency of the Personality of Godhead. The Lord therefore says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.42): \u201cBut what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.\u201d The omnipotent Personality of Godhead is actually the well-wishing friend of every living entity (suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m). Therefore, if one becomes sane and understands that one\u2019s well-wishing friend K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate source and controller of everything that exists, one attains immediate peace (j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 \u015b\u0101ntim \u1e5bcchati). Fear and illusion arise when one foolishly thinks that even one atom of the creation is not the controlled potency of the Personality of Godhead. Bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101t. Denying the existence of the material world also creates a very dangerous situation of illusion. Both types of atheism \u2014 namely, seeing the material world as belonging to oneself (and therefore being meant for one\u2019s sense gratification) and declaring the nonexistence of the material world \u2014 are futile attempts to avoid one\u2019s eternal subordination to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the actual owner and enjoyer of everything. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has quoted the following question stated by \u015ar\u012b Maitreya to \u015ar\u012b Par\u0101\u015bara in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (1.3.1): \u201cHow are we to understand that Brahman, the Supreme Soul, is the executor of the creation, maintenance and destruction of the material world, even though it is devoid of qualities, immeasurable, unembodied and free from any fault?\u201d In reply, \u015ar\u012b Par\u0101\u015bara stated: \u201cMere logic cannot explain how even material objects expand their potency. These things can be understood by mature observation. The Absolute Truth expands His potency in the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world just as fire expands its potency of heat.\u201d (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 1.3.2) \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b explains that one can understand the power of a valuable gem not by logical statements but by observing the effect of the gem. Similarly, one can understand the potency of a mantra by observing its power to achieve a particular effect. Such potency doesn\u2019t depend on so-called logic. There is no logical necessity for a seed\u2019s growing into a tree and giving fruits that nourish the human body. One may argue that the genetic code for the entire tree is contained within the seed. But there is no logical necessity for the existence of the seed, nor for the seed\u2019s expanding itself into a gigantic tree. Ex post facto, or after the manifestation of the wonderful material nature, the foolish material scientist traces out the expansion of a seed\u2019s potency in an apparently logical sequence of events. But there is nothing within the realm of so-called pure logic that dictates that a seed should expand into a tree. Rather, such expansion should be understood to be the potency of the tree. Similarly, the potency of a jewel is its mystic power, and various mantras also contain innate potencies. Ultimately the mah\u0101-mantra \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 has the potency to transfer one to the spiritual world of bliss and knowledge. In the same way, the Absolute Truth has the natural quality of expanding itself into innumerable varieties of material and spiritual worlds. We may logically describe this expansion after the fact, but we cannot deny the expansion of the Absolute Truth. The conditioned soul who purifies his consciousness through the process of devotional service can scientifically observe the expansion of the Absolute Truth as described here, just as one who is not blind can observe the expansion of a seed into a huge tree. One can understand the potency of a seed not by speculation but rather by practical observation. Similarly, one must purify his vision so that he can practically observe the expansion of the Absolute Truth. Such observation can take place either by the ears or by the eyes. Vedic knowledge is \u015babda-brahma, or transcendental potency in the form of sound vibration. Therefore, one can observe the functions of the Absolute Truth through submissive hearing of transcendental sound. \u015b\u0101stra-cak\u1e63us. When one\u2019s consciousness becomes fully purified one can perceive the Absolute Truth with all of one\u2019s spiritualized senses. The Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is devoid of material qualities such as mundane goodness, passion and ignorance because He is an ocean of transcendental qualities and therefore has no need for the inferior qualities of the material world. As stated in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (4.10), m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 tu prak\u1e5bti\u1e41 vidy\u0101n m\u0101yina\u1e41 tu mahe\u015bvaram: \u201cUnderstand that m\u0101y\u0101 is the material energy whereas the Supreme Lord is the Supreme Lord of m\u0101y\u0101.\u201d Similarly, it is stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 ca tad-ap\u0101\u015bray\u0101m: m\u0101y\u0101 is always under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as it is understood from the above discussion that the material world is an emanation from the impersonal Brahman potency of the Lord, Brahman itself is an expansion of the potency of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham). \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that in the impersonal Brahman there is neither transcendental activity nor the supreme pum-artha, or benefit of human life, namely prema, love of Godhead. Therefore, if one is prematurely dazzled by the expansion of the Lord\u2019s bodily effulgence, known as Brahman, and therefore does not actually come to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no possibility of actually understanding one\u2019s eternal identity as an eternal blissful expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The subject matter is summarized in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 1.3):"

        "translation": "Brahman, the eternal soul, was never born and will never die, nor does it grow or decay. That spiritual soul is actually the knower of the youth, middle age and death of the material body. Thus the soul can be understood to be pure consciousness, existing everywhere at all times and never being destroyed. Just as the life air within the body, although one, becomes manifest as many in contact with the various material senses, the one soul appears to assume various material designations in contact with the material body.",
        "purport": " The Vedic aphorism sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma, \u201cEverything is Brahman,\u201d has been explained in this chapter of the Bh\u0101gavatam. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original source of everything. By expanding His internal potency, He manifests the spiritual world, and by expanding His external potency He manifests the material cosmos. The conditioned living entity is originally part and parcel of the superior, internal potency of the Lord, but being in contact with illusion, he falls under the clutches of the external potency. In any case, since everything is an expansion of the potency of the Supreme Brahman, everything is part and parcel of the Lord\u2019s spiritual potency. Bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101d \u012b\u015b\u0101d apetasya viparyayo\u00a0\u2019sm\u1e5bti\u1e25. When a living entity thinks that the material world is not part and parcel of the Lord\u2019s potency but is a separate existence, liable to be controlled and enjoyed by the tiny j\u012bva soul, he is under viparyaya\u1e25, or a wrong conception. Asm\u1e5bti\u1e25. Thus the living entity forgets that the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of everything, everything being an expansion of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has pointed out that although the Lord\u2019s external potency is subject to transformations such as birth, growth, decay and death, one should not foolishly conclude that the Lord\u2019s internal potency, the living entity, is also subject to these changes. Both the living entity and material nature are ultimately Brahman, being expansions of the Supreme Brahman. But the Vedas clearly say, par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate: the Lord\u2019s potencies are vividh\u0101, or multifarious. Thus, according to this verse, n\u0101tm\u0101 jaj\u0101na na mari\u1e63yati naidhate\u00a0\u2019sau na k\u1e63\u012byate: the soul is never born, nor does he die, and he certainly cannot grow or decay like a material body. Although the visible material body passes through boyhood, adolescence and old age, or although one may take birth as a demigod, human being, plant or animal, the spirit soul never changes his eternal constitutional position. Rather, he falsely identifies with the external transformations of the material body and thus imposes upon himself a psychological condition called illusion. This miserable illusory experience of seeing oneself transformed and ultimately annihilated by the laws of nature can be nullified by transcendental knowledge of one\u2019s eternal status as the superior energy of the Lord. The word sarvatra in this verse should not be foolishly misinterpreted to mean that the individual j\u012bva soul is all-pervading. The soul is not born, nor does he die. Yet in our present conditioned state we falsely identify with the birth and death of the body. Therefore, because an all-pervading soul would never fall into illusion, sarvatra cannot indicate that the individual soul is all-pervading. Illusion implies an incomplete understanding of reality, which would not be possible for an all-pervading entity. Therefore, the word sarvatra is understood to mean that the pure spiritual soul exists in all material conditions. In deep sleep, for example, consciousness may not overtly be manifest, and yet the spirit soul is understood to be present within the body. Similarly, it is understood from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the spirit soul (nitya\u1e25 sarva-gata\u1e25) may exist even within fire, water or outer space, since the existence of the soul never depends upon material conditions but is an eternal fact. The consciousness of the soul is more or less manifest according to the possibilities offered by a particular material situation, just as electric light is manifest in a particular intensity and color according to the bulb available. The electrical energy is one, but it is manifested variously according to material conditions. The argument may be raised that although the spirit soul is pure consciousness (upalabdhi-m\u0101tram), it is our practical experience that consciousness is constantly transformed. If I am thinking of a blue object such as the sky, then my previous thought of a yellow object such as a flower is destroyed. Similarly, if I become aware that I am hungry, then my consciousness of the blue sky is destroyed. In this way, consciousness is constantly being transformed. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has replied that consciousness itself is eternal, but in contact with the material senses it may be manifest in various ways. The example of the life air is very appropriate. Pr\u0101\u1e47a, or the life air, is one, but in contact with the different senses it is manifest as the power to see, the power to hear, and so on. Similarly, consciousness, being spiritual, is ultimately one, but when in contact with the various senses it may be perceived in terms of particular sensory functions. But the state of consciousness is an eternal fact that cannot be changed, although it may be temporarily covered by m\u0101y\u0101. When one becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he is understood to be dh\u012bra (dh\u012bras tatra na muhyati). At that time one is no longer subject to bewilderment by falsely identifying his consciousness with the transformations of material nature. From the statement tat tvam asi, found in the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad, it is to be understood that spiritual knowledge is not impersonal but entails gradually perceiving the pure spiritual soul within the material body. Just as in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a repeatedly says aham, or \u201cI,\u201d this Vedic aphorism uses the word tvam, or \u201cyou,\u201d to indicate that just as the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual spark of Brahman (tat) is also an eternal personality (tvam). Therefore, according to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b it is to be understood that the individual spark of Brahman is eternally conscious. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has further pointed out that instead of wasting time trying to understand the truth in its impersonal aspect, which is merely the negation of temporary material variety, one should try to understand oneself to be an eternally conscious entity in the j\u012bva category. In other words, one should understand oneself to be eternally a conscious servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted the following statement from the Mok\u1e63a-dharma section of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata: \u201cThe living entity, known as j\u012bva, is not different from Me, for he is My expansion. Thus the living entity is eternal, as I am, and always exists within Me. But you should not artificially think, \u2018Now I have seen the soul.\u2019 Rather, I, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, will bestow this benediction upon you when you are actually qualified.\u201d"

Some species are born from eggs, others from embryos, others from the seeds of plants and trees, and others from perspiration. But in all species of life the pr\u0101\u1e47a, or vital air, remains unchanging and follows the spirit soul from one body to another. Similarly, the spirit soul is eternally the same despite its material condition of life. We have practical experience of this. When we are absorbed in deep sleep without dreaming, the material senses become inactive, and even the mind and false ego are merged into a dormant condition. But although the senses, mind and false ego are inactive, one remembers upon waking that he, the soul, was peacefully sleeping.",
        "purport": " When a living entity is awake the material senses and mind are constantly active. Similarly, when one is sleeping the false ego recollects one\u2019s waking experiences, and thus one experiences dreams or fragments of dreams while sleeping. But in the state of prasupti, or deep sleep, both the mind and the senses become inactive, and the false ego does not recall previous experiences or desires. The subtle mind and false ego are called li\u1e45ga-\u015bar\u012bra, or the subtle material body. This li\u1e45ga-\u015bar\u012bra is experienced in the form of temporary material designations such as \u201cI am a rich man,\u201d \u201cI am a strong man,\u201d \u201cI am black,\u201d \u201cI am white,\u201d \u201cI am American,\u201d \u201cI am Chinese.\u201d The sum total of one\u2019s illusory conceptions of oneself is called aha\u1e45k\u0101ra, or false ego. And due to this illusory conception of life the living entity transmigrates from one species of life to another, as clearly explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The spirit soul, however, does not change its constitutional position of eternity, knowledge and bliss, although the soul may temporarily forget this position. To cite an analogous situation, if one dreams at night that he is walking in the forest, such a dream does not change one\u2019s actual position of lying in bed within his apartment. Thus it is stated in this verse, k\u016b\u1e6da-stha \u0101\u015bayam \u1e5bte: despite the transformations of the subtle body, the spirit soul does not change. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has given the following example to illustrate this point. Et\u0101vanta\u1e41 k\u0101la\u1e41 sukham aham asv\u0101psam, na ki\u00f1cid avedi\u1e63am. One often thinks, \u201cI was sleeping very peacefully, although I was not dreaming or aware of anything.\u201d It can be logically understood that one cannot remember something of which he has had no experience. Therefore, since one remembers peacefully sleeping although there was no mental or sensual experience, such a memory should be understood to be a vague experience of the spirit soul. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has explained that the demigods, who are a superior race of humanlike entities on the higher planetary systems of this universe, do not actually undergo the gross ignorance of deep sleep as do ordinary human beings. Because the demigods have superior intelligence, they are not merged into ignorance at the time of sleeping. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca. Sleep is apohanam, or forgetfulness. Sometimes by dreaming there is sm\u1e5bti, or memory of one\u2019s actual condition, although in a dream one may experience one\u2019s family or friends in an altered, illusory state. But all such conditions of remembering and forgetting are due to the presence of the Supersoul within the heart. By the mercy of the Supersoul one can have a preliminary glimpse of the soul by remembering how one was peacefully resting even without mental or sensual experience. According to the authorized commentaries on this verse, avini\u015bcite\u1e63u means sveda-je\u1e63u, or born from perspiration. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has pointed out, bh\u016b-svedena hi pr\u0101yo j\u0101yante: the earth\u2019s dew is to be considered the perspiration of the earth, and various species of life are generated from dew. In the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (3.1.9) the situation of the soul in relation to pr\u0101\u1e47a is explained: \u201cThe soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [pr\u0101\u1e47a, ap\u0101na, vy\u0101na, sam\u0101na and ud\u0101na]. The soul is situated within the heart, and it spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited.\u201d Thus in the innumerable species of life the spiritual soul remains situated within pr\u0101\u1e47a, or the material life air."

        "translation": "When one seriously engages in the devotional service of the Personality of Godhead, fixing the Lord\u2019s lotus feet within one\u2019s heart as the only goal of life, one can destroy the innumerable impure desires lodged within the heart as a result of one\u2019s previous fruitive work within the three modes of material nature. When the heart is thus purified one can directly perceive both the Supreme Lord and one\u2019s self as transcendental entities. Thus one becomes perfect in spiritual understanding through direct experience, just as one can directly experience the sunshine through normal, healthy vision.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse it was explained that one can have a preliminary glimpse of the eternal, unchanging soul by remembering one\u2019s experience of peacefully sleeping even while the mind and senses were totally inactive. One may ask, If in deep sleep there is a preliminary experience of the soul, why upon waking does one return to illusory material existence? It may be answered that because of material desires lodged within the heart the conditioned soul is addicted to the nescience of material sense gratification. A prisoner may glimpse through the bars the free light outside the prison window but still remain captive behind the bars. Similarly, although a conditioned soul may have a glimpse of the spirit soul, he remains captured within the bondage of material desires. Therefore, although one may have a preliminary understanding of the eternal soul that exists within the temporary body, or even of the Supersoul that accompanies the individual soul within the heart, a specific process is still required to eliminate the cause of material existence, namely material desire. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.6): \u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.\u201d According to one\u2019s desire at the time of death a suitable material body is awarded by material nature. Karma\u1e47\u0101 daiva-netre\u1e47a jantur dehopapattaye. According to one\u2019s fruitive desires and actions and under the jurisdiction of the representatives of the Lord called demigods, the living entity is awarded a particular material body, which is inevitably subject to harassment by birth, death, old age and disease. If one can eliminate the cause of a particular phenomenon, logically he also eliminates the effect. Therefore, this verse states that one should desire only to achieve shelter at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. One should give up illusory desires for material society, friendship and love, since such desires cause further material bondage. One should fix his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, so that without fail one can remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of death. As the Lord states: \u201cWhoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.\u201d (Bg. 8.5) The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the actual shelter for every living being. And the Lord can be directly perceived as soon as one\u2019s heart has become transparently clean through bhakti-yoga. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 describes the state of achieving the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the words tato m\u0101\u1e41 tattvato j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 vi\u015bate tad-anantaram, and sometimes impersonalists falsely interpret these words to be a description of brahma-s\u0101yujyam, or impersonal merging into the existence of the Lord. It is clearly mentioned in this verse that one must fix his mind and devotion on the lotus feet of abja-n\u0101bha, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If the individual living entity were equal to the Personality of Godhead, the living entity could simply think of himself in order to be purified. But even then a contradiction would arise: the Personality of Godhead has no need to be purified, since He is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as pavitra\u1e41 paramam, or the supreme pure. Therefore, one should not artificially try to twist an impersonal meaning out of the statements of the Vedic literature. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has stated that the perfect stage of devotional service indicated in this verse can be observed in the activities of such great devotees as Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja approached the Personality of Godhead desiring a political adjustment on the material platform, but when purified by chanting the holy name of God (o\u1e41 namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya) he felt no further need for material sense gratification. As stated in the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, janayaty \u0101\u015bu vair\u0101gyam. As soon as one advances in devotional service, one is freed from the embarrassment of superficial material desires. The words upalabhyata \u0101tma-tattvam are significant in this verse. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that \u0101tma-tattvam, or knowledge of the soul, indicates knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead along with His various expansions such as the impersonal brahmajyoti and the marginal living entity himself. As indicated here by the word s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t, perceiving the Personality of Godhead means seeing the personal form of the Lord, His hands and legs, His various transcendental vehicles and servants, and so on, just as by devotion to the sun-god one can gradually perceive the personal body of the sun-god, along with his chariot and personal attendants. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that in verses 35 through 39 the various stages of standard logic are demonstrated. Verse 35 establishes the vi\u1e63aya, or general thesis. Verse 36 manifests sa\u1e41\u015baya, or an expression of doubt. Verse 37 gives the p\u016brva-pak\u1e63a, or opposing argument. And verse 38 definitely establishes the siddh\u0101nta, or conclusion. Verse 39 presents sa\u1e45gati, the summary. The sa\u1e45gati, or final word, is that one should become a pure devotee of the Personality of Godhead and worship the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. Thus by cleansing the mirror of the heart one can see the Lord, just as a normal human being with healthy 20/20 vision can very easily see the brilliant rays of the sun or as an advanced devotee of the sun-god himself can see the personal body of the sun-god."

        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.5): \u201cAll men are forced to act helplessly according to the impulses born of the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment.\u201d Since the living entity cannot remain inactive, he must learn to dedicate his activities to the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da comments on this verse from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as follows: \u201cIt is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the \u015b\u0101stras. But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him.\u201d Ordinary people often question the busy activities of the devotees of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, mistaking such activities to be ordinary material work. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated in this connection, k\u0101mya-karm\u0101\u1e47y eva ty\u0101jit\u0101ni, na tu nitya-naimittik\u0101ni, phalasyaiva vininditatv\u0101t. One should give up selfish activities performed for one\u2019s personal sense gratification, since the result of such thoughtless work is further material bondage. But one should offer one\u2019s regular or occasional occupational duties to the Supreme Lord, and thus such activities become transcendental devotional service. By the words tasm\u0101d guru\u1e41 prapadyeta jij\u00f1\u0101su\u1e25 \u015breya uttamam, this chapter has clearly explained that dovetailing one\u2019s work with the service of the Lord is an art one should learn at the lotus feet of the bona fide spiritual master. Otherwise, if one whimsically declares his materialistic work to be transcendental devotional service, there will be no actual result. Therefore, according to \u015ar\u012b J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, one should not mistake the word nai\u1e63karmyam to indicate inactivity; rather, it indicates transcendental activity under the guidance of the Lord and His representative."

This difficult subject matter can never be understood by mundane speculation. The authorized Vedic literature is the sound incarnation of the Personality of Godhead Himself, and thus Vedic knowledge is perfect. Even the greatest learned scholars are bewildered in their attempts to understand the science of action if they neglect the authority of Vedic knowledge.",
        "purport": " Prescribed duties authorized by revealed scripture are called karma, whereas the failure to execute one\u2019s highest duty is called akarma. The performance of forbidden activities is called vikarma. Thus karma, akarma and vikarma are established by the authorized explanations of Vedic literature. They cannot be ascertained merely through mundane exercises in logic. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (6.16.51) the Lord says, \u015babda-brahma para\u1e41 brahma mamobhe \u015b\u0101\u015bvat\u012b tan\u016b: \u201cI am the form of the transcendental vibrations of the Vedas, such as o\u1e41k\u0101ra and Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Hare R\u0101ma, and I am the Supreme Absolute Truth. These two forms of Mine \u2014 namely, the transcendental Vedic sound and the eternally blissful spiritual form of the Deity \u2014 are My eternal forms; they are not material.\u201d Similarly, it is stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam (6.1.40), vedo n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t svayambh\u016br iti \u015bu\u015bruma: \u201cThe Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamar\u0101ja.\u201d In the Puru\u1e63a-s\u016bkta (\u1e5ag Veda, ma\u1e47\u1e0dala 10, s\u016bkta 90, mantra 9) it is stated, tasm\u0101d yaj\u00f1\u0101t sarva-huta \u1e5bca\u1e25 s\u0101m\u0101ni jaj\u00f1ire/ chand\u0101\u1e41si jaj\u00f1ire tasm\u0101t: \u201cFrom Him, Yaj\u00f1a, came all sacrificial offerings, hymns of invocation and songs of praise. All the mantras of the Vedas come from the Lord.\u201d All the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are completely transcendental and free from the four defects of conditional life, namely mistakes, illusion, cheating and imperfect senses. So Vedic knowledge, being a plenary manifestation of the Supreme Lord, is similarly infallible and transcendental. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that in the material world, which is controlled by the illusory energy of the Lord, a particular sound vibration is discarded after describing its object. But on the spiritual platform called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha nothing is ever lost, and thus \u015babda-brahma, or the Personality of Godhead in His form as transcendental sound, is eternal. In ordinary human discourse one can ascertain the meaning of human words by understanding the intention of the speaker. But since Vedic knowledge is apauru\u1e63eya, or transcendental, one can appreciate its purport only by hearing from the standard authorities in the chain of disciplic succession. This process is prescribed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (eva\u1e41 parampar\u0101-pr\u0101ptam). Thus, even highly learned scholars who proudly neglect this simple descending process are certainly bewildered and embarrassed in their hopeless attempt to ascertain the ultimate meaning of Vedic knowledge. The four sons of Lord Brahm\u0101 declined to answer the question of King Nimi since at that time the King was a mere child and therefore not capable of seriously surrendering to the process of hearing through disciplic succession. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has pointed out in this regard, \u012b\u015bvar\u0101tmatv\u0101d \u012b\u015bvara-vi\u1e63ayatv\u0101t. Because the Vedas describe the unlimited Personality of Godhead, Vedic knowledge cannot be approached by mundane methods of comprehension."

        "translation": "Childish and foolish people are attached to materialistic, fruitive activities, although the actual goal of life is to become free from such activities. Therefore, the Vedic injunctions indirectly lead one to the path of ultimate liberation by first prescribing fruitive religious activities, just as a father promises his child candy so that the child will take his medicine.",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, traigu\u1e47ya-vi\u1e63ay\u0101 ved\u0101 nistraigu\u1e47yo bhav\u0101rjuna. The Vedas apparently offer fruitive results within the three modes of material nature. Those who perform ritualistic ceremonies or austerities in the mode of goodness are offered the chance for promotion to the higher planetary systems called Svargaloka. A\u015bnanti divy\u0101n divi deva-bhog\u0101n. Similarly, those who perform karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, or fruitive religious activities in the mode of passion, are allowed to become great rulers or wealthy men on earth and enjoy great prestige and earthly power. But as stated in the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, prav\u1e5bttir e\u1e63\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 niv\u1e5bttis tu mah\u0101-phal\u0101: \u201cAlthough fruitive religious activities are very much popular among the conditioned souls, the actual perfection of life is achieved when one gives up all fruitive endeavor.\u201d If a father tells his child, \u201cYou must take this medicine by my order,\u201d the child may become fearful and rebellious and reject the medicine. Therefore, the father entices his child by saying, \u201cI am going to give you a delicious piece of candy. But if you want this candy, first just take this little bit of medicine, and then you can have the candy.\u201d Such indirect persuasion is called parok\u1e63a-v\u0101da\u1e25, or an indirect description that conceals the actual purpose. The father presents his proposal to the child as if the ultimate goal were to receive the candy and only a minor condition must be fulfilled to receive it. Actually, however, the father\u2019s goal is to administer the medicine to the child and cure him of his disease. Thus, describing the primary purpose indirectly and concealing it with a secondary proposal is called parok\u1e63a-v\u0101da\u1e25, or indirect persuasion. Since the great majority of conditioned souls are addicted to sense gratification (prav\u1e5bttir e\u1e63\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m), the Vedic karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da rituals offer them a chance to become free from temporary materialistic sense gratification by making them greedy for fruitive Vedic results such as promotion to heaven or a powerful ruling position on earth. In all Vedic rituals Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped, and thus one is gradually promoted to the understanding that one\u2019s actual self-interest is to surrender to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um. Such an indirect method is prescribed for b\u0101l\u0101n\u0101m, those who are childish or foolish. An intelligent person can immediately understand by direct analysis the actual purpose of Vedic literature as described by the Lord Himself (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). All Vedic knowledge ultimately aims at achieving shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without such shelter one must rotate within the 8,400,000 species offered by the illusory energy of the Lord. Ordinary material vision, either through gross sense perception or the subtle perception of rational induction, always yields imperfect knowledge distorted by the desire for illusory material enjoyment. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments that the cultivation of impersonal self-realization is also a disturbance to the conditioned souls, since the impersonal speculative process is an artificial attempt to become completely formless. Such an attempt is not at all in accord with the proper judgment of the Vedas, which is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). In Lord Caitanya\u2019s movement there is no need to childishly pursue fruitive material results and gradually be dragged to actual knowledge. According to Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: In Kali-yuga life is very short (pr\u0101ye\u1e47\u0101lp\u0101yu\u1e63a\u1e25), and people are generally undisciplined (mand\u0101\u1e25), misguided (sumanda-mataya\u1e25), and overwhelmed by the unfavorable results of their previous activities (manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101\u1e25). Thus their minds are never peaceful (upadrut\u0101\u1e25), and their very brief life span vitiates the possibility of their gradually progressing through the path of Vedic ritualistic activities. Therefore, the only hope is to chant the holy names of the Lord, harer n\u0101ma. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.3.51) it is stated: Kali-yuga is an ocean of hypocrisy and pollution. In Kali-yuga all natural elements are polluted, such as water, earth, sky, mind, intelligence and ego. The only auspicious aspect of this fallen age is the process of chanting the holy names of the Lord (asti hy eko mah\u0101n gu\u1e47a\u1e25). Simply by the delightful process of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-k\u012brtana one is freed from his connection to this fallen age (mukta-sa\u1e45ga) and goes back home, back to Godhead (para\u1e41 vrajet). Sometimes the preachers of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement also use the parok\u1e63a, or indirect method of persuasion, offering a nice transcendental sweet to the conditioned soul to entice him to come to the lotus feet of the Lord. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s movement is kevala \u0101nanda-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, simply blissful. But by the mercy of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu even one who is indirectly attracted to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement achieves very quickly the perfection of life and goes back home, back to Godhead."

        "translation": "If an ignorant person who has not conquered the material senses does not adhere to the Vedic injunctions, certainly he will engage in sinful and irreligious activities. Thus his reward will be repeated birth and death.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse it was stated that although fruitive activities are prescribed in the Vedas, the actual goal of human life is to free oneself from all materialistic activities. Therefore, one may conclude that there is no need to perform the Vedic rituals, which offer regulated sense gratification. But an ignorant person, or, in other words, one who has not understood that he is not the material body but an eternal spiritual soul, part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, will invariably be unable to control the urges of the material senses. Therefore, if such a materially inclined person neglects the Vedic injunctions that administer regulated sense gratification, he will surely fall down into unregulated sense gratification in p\u0101pa, or sinful life. For example, those who are affected by sexual desire are ordered to accept the viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a, or religious marriage ceremony. We often see that because of false pride a so-called brahmac\u0101r\u012b, or celibate student of Vedic knowledge, rejects the marriage ceremony as m\u0101y\u0101, or material illusion. But if such a celibate student is unable to control his senses he will undoubtedly degrade himself by eventually engaging in illicit sex, which has no connection to Vedic culture. Similarly, a neophyte in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is encouraged to eat k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101dam to his full satisfaction. Sometimes an immature practitioner of bhakti-yoga tries to make a show of severe eating habits and eventually falls down into eating unregulated and abominable foodstuffs. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the words m\u1e5btyor m\u1e5btyum upaiti mean that a sinful person is awarded a free ticket to hell by the lord of death himself, Yamar\u0101ja. This is also described in the Vedas as follows: m\u1e5btv\u0101 punar m\u1e5btyum \u0101padyate ardyam\u0101na\u1e25 sva-karmabhi\u1e25. \u201cPersons who cause themselves severe pain by their materialistic activities gain no relief at the moment of death, for they are placed again in a situation in which death will occur.\u201d Therefore, Vedic ritualistic activities such as the wedding ceremony or the relishing of sumptuous yaj\u00f1a-\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da, or food remnants of sacrifice, should not be given up by those whose senses are not yet controlled. The previous verse gave the example of a father\u2019s administering candy to his son to induce the child to take medicine. If the child rejects the father\u2019s offer, thinking that the candy is unnecessary, the child also misses the opportunity to take the medicine that will cure him. Similarly, if a materialistic person rejects the Vedic injunctions that administer prescribed sense gratification, he will not be purified but instead will be further degraded. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has described a materialistic person as one whose mind and intelligence are not faithfully fixed in the message of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 \u015ar\u012b Bhagav\u0101n, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, gives wonderful explanations to the conditioned souls, represented by Arjuna, concerning the actual goal of life. One who cannot fix his mind on these instructions is to be considered a materialistic person who is inclined toward sinful activities and who must therefore submit himself to the standard Vedic injunctions. Such Vedic injunctions, even though fruitive, are considered pu\u1e47ya, or pious, according to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, and thus one who strictly performs them will not go to hell. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself states in the Bh\u0101gavatam (11.20.9): \u201cOne should continue to perform the Vedic ritualistic activities until one actually becomes detached from material sense gratification and develops faith for hearing and chanting about Me.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that the Vedas prescribe that one rise early in the morning, bathe, and chant the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra. If one artificially gives up such a disciplined, regulated life, one will gradually become a victim of activities for gross sense gratification, such as eating in restaurants and indulging in illicit connections with women. Thus losing control of his senses, he becomes just like an animal, engaging from the early morning until the night in dangerous activities. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has commented in this regard, aj\u00f1a\u1e25 sann \u0101carann api. Although in ignorance, one continues to act, not considering the future result of one\u2019s activities. Such indifference to the future result of one\u2019s activities is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to be a symptom of the mode of ignorance. Just as an intelligent man will not drive his car on a highway if he knows the highway will lead him to danger, an intelligent man will not perform non-Vedic activities if he knows that the ultimate result will be the disaster described here by the words m\u1e5btyor m\u1e5btyum upaiti. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has stated that ignorant persons sometimes think that after death one automatically attains everlasting peace. But by the powerful reactions of one\u2019s sinful activities one comes to a most unpeaceful condition, for one must suffer hellish miseries in exchange for the meager temporary fruits of material work. Such hellish reactions occur not once but perpetually, as long as one is indifferent to the Vedic injunctions."

The material fruitive results offered in the revealed scriptures are not the actual goal of Vedic knowledge, but are meant for stimulating the interest of the performer.",
        "purport": " Human life is an opportunity offered by the laws of nature to the conditioned soul so that he may understand his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unfortunately, even in the human form of life most living entities remain addicted to improving the standard of animal activities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. Almost no one is interested in the actual success of life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. \u201cThose persons who are materially engrossed, being blind to the knowledge of ultimate truth, have many subject matters for hearing in human society, O Emperor.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.1.2) It is stated, parama-k\u0101ru\u1e47iko veda\u1e25 \u2014 \u201cVedic knowledge is supremely merciful\u201d \u2014 because it engages the animalistic human beings in a gradual process of purification that culminates in full consciousness of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). The majority of human beings are not able to suddenly give up material sense gratification, even though they understand from Vedic literature that such sense gratification causes a pernicious future effect. We have practical experience in the Western countries that when the government informed the citizens that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, most people were unable to give up their smoking habit. Therefore, the Vedic literature prescribes a gradual process of purification in which the conditioned soul learns to offer the results of his material activities to the Supreme Lord, thus spiritualizing those activities. Material sense gratification is based on two organs, namely the tongue for tasting and the genitals for sex life. By offering palatable food to the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then enjoying the remnants as k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101dam and by accepting the rules and regulations for Vedic householder life and begetting of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious children, one can gradually bring the full range of material activities to the platform of pure devotional service. By offering the fruits of one\u2019s ordinary activities to the Supreme Lord, one gradually understands that the Lord Himself, and not material sense gratification, is the actual goal of life. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a warns in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that if people are prematurely encouraged to give up householder life or the sumptuous remnants of the Lord\u2019s pras\u0101dam, such artificial renunciation will have the opposite effect. There is a class of duplicitous men who misunderstand the transcendental purpose of the Vedas and falsely claim that material fruitive results such as promotion to heaven, which is offered in the agni\u1e63\u1e6doma sacrifice, constitute the ultimate goal of the Vedas. Such foolish men have been described by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u201cMen of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.\u201d (Bg. 2.42-43) To refute such a foolish understanding of the Vedic purpose, this verse uses the word ni\u1e25sa\u1e45ga\u1e25, which means \u201cwithout attachment to material results.\u201d The actual purpose of the Vedas is arpitam \u012b\u015bvare, to offer everything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The result is siddhim, or the perfection of life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The words rocan\u0101rth\u0101 phala-\u015bruti\u1e25 clearly indicate that the fruitive results promised in the Vedic literature are meant to stimulate a materialistic person to have faith in the Vedic injunctions. The example is given that a child may be offered candy-covered medicine. The child becomes enthusiastic to take the medicine because of the candy coating, whereas a mature person will be enthusiastic to take the medicine itself, knowing that such medicine is meant for his real self-interest. The mature platform of Vedic understanding is mentioned in the B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (4.4.22): tam eta\u1e41 ved\u0101nuvacanena br\u0101hma\u1e47\u0101 vividi\u1e63anti brahmacarye\u1e47a tapas\u0101 \u015braddhay\u0101 yaj\u00f1en\u0101n\u0101\u015bakena ca. \u201cBy the teaching of the Vedas and by celibacy, penances, faith and controlled eating, great br\u0101hma\u1e47as come to know the Supreme.\u201d The Supreme is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Although the prescribed rituals of the Vedas may sometimes resemble material fruitive work, the activity is spiritualized because the result is offered to the Supreme. Candy-covered medicine and ordinary candy may appear or taste the same. But the candy-covered medicine has a therapeutic effect not found in ordinary candy. Similarly, the words nai\u1e63karmya\u1e41 labhate siddhim in this verse indicate that a faithful follower of the Vedic injunctions will gradually be promoted to the highest perfection of life, pure love of Godhead, as stated by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu (prem\u0101 pum-artho mah\u0101n)."

        "translation": "One who desires to quickly cut the knot of false ego, which binds the spirit soul, should worship the Supreme Lord, Ke\u015bava, by the regulations found in Vedic literatures such as the tantras.",
        "purport": " The Vedic literatures contain mysterious descriptions of the Absolute Truth that stimulate philosophical speculation. The Vedas also offer heavenly rewards for the performance of ritualistic ceremonies. But as stated in verse 44 of this chapter such j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da and karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da sections of the Vedas are b\u0101l\u0101n\u0101m anu\u015b\u0101sanam; that is, because less intelligent or childish persons are addicted to mental speculation and fruitive activity, these sections of the Vedas are meant to attract such persons to take shelter of the Vedic injunctions for gradual promotion to the perfect stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Now that the path for those who are materialistic has been described in several verses, this verse describes the process for those who are vij\u00f1a\u1e25, or learned transcendentalists. Such learned transcendentalists are advised to follow the regulated worship described in such Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava tantras as \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra for pleasing the Supreme Lord directly. The words upacared deva\u1e41 tantroktena ca ke\u015bavam indicate that one should directly worship Ke\u015bava, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appears in many different incarnations to please His devotees. \u015ar\u012bla Jayadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has described the pastimes of the Lord in his song describing ten prominent incarnations of the Personality of Godhead, Ke\u015bava: Lord Fish, Lord Tortoise, Lord Boar, Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, Lord V\u0101mana, Lord Para\u015bur\u0101ma, Lord R\u0101macandra, Lord Balar\u0101ma, Lord Buddha and Lord Kalki. The words upacared devam indicate devotional service to the Personality of Godhead. And therefore the word tantroktena, or \u201cinjunctions of the tantras,\u201d should be understood to indicate vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-tantras such as \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, which give explicit and detailed instructions for worshiping Ke\u015bava. The Vedas are referred to by the term nigama. And the elaborate explanation of these nigamas is called \u0101gama, or tantra. When the transcendental living entity becomes perturbed by the obnoxious harassment of material bodily dualities, he becomes eager to hear from the Vedas about his transcendental situation. The word \u0101\u015bu in this verse indicates that those who are eager to put a quick end to material existence and situate themselves in the eternal blissful life of perfect knowledge should directly worship Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, bypassing the preliminary Vedic rituals described in the previous verses."

It is stated in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: A bona fide spiritual master must be a soul surrendered at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. In the Brahma-vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is stated: \u201cOne pollutes his own intelligence and exhibits severe weakness of character when he rejects his own spiritual master. Indeed, such a person has already rejected the Supreme Lord, Hari.\u201d The bona fide disciple should always remember that his entire understanding of Vedic knowledge is coming through the mercy of his bona fide spiritual master. If one superficially or whimsically accepts and rejects a bona fide Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava spiritual master, sometimes becoming attracted to another spiritual master, one commits a vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dha, a great offense against the devotees of the Lord. Sometimes a foolish neophyte mistakenly thinks that the relationship with the spiritual master is meant for the sense gratification of the disciple, and therefore in the name of spiritual aspirations such a fool gives up a bona fide Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava guru. One should understand oneself to be the eternal servant of the guru. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, however, has quoted this verse from the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra: \u201cOne who is initiated into a mantra by a non-Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava must go to hell. Therefore he should again be initiated properly, according to the prescribed method, by a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava guru.\u201d It is the duty of the bona fide spiritual master to examine carefully the qualification of the disciple, and the disciple should similarly approach a bona fide spiritual master. Otherwise, the foolish disciple and the indiscriminate guru may both be punished by the laws of nature. One should not artificially try to assimilate all of the apparently conflicting branches of Vedic knowledge. Vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. Conditioned souls have various conflicting natures, which are engaged by apparently conflicting Vedic injunctions called prav\u1e5btti and niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga. But the easiest path is simply to learn the process of regularly worshiping advaya-j\u00f1\u0101na, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. All the demigods mentioned in the Vedas are paraphernalia for the service of the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Whatever exists in the visible material world is also meant to be engaged in the Lord\u2019s service; otherwise, it has no value. If one artificially renounces material things useful in the service of the Supreme Lord, he loses his spiritual qualification of seeing everything as meant for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pleasure and will be forced to think of material objects as meant for his own sense enjoyment. In other words, material things should be accepted or rejected according to the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, one will fall down from the standard of pure devotional service. As stated in this verse, labdhv\u0101nugraha \u0101c\u0101ry\u0101t: such discrimination can be learned when one receives the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master, who reveals to the sincere disciple the practical application of Vedic knowledge."

The word \u015buci\u1e25 means that one should be internally and externally clean. \u015auci\u1e25 means that one should perform activities only for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If somehow or other one can remember the Supreme Lord constantly by chanting and hearing His holy name, one will come to the pure stage of life, as described in this Vedic mantra: \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that although one may mark the body with sacred tilaka, perform mudr\u0101s and chant mantras, if one is thinking within his mind of material sense gratification his worship of Lord \u015ar\u012b Hari is bogus. Therefore the word \u015buci\u1e25 here indicates that one should worship the Lord in a favorable frame of mind, considering the Lord to be sacred and one\u2019s self to be an insignificant servant of the Lord. Those who are not favorably inclined toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not like to worship the Deity in the temple, and they discourage people from going to the temple of the Lord by saying that since the Lord is omnipresent there is no need to do so. Such envious persons prefer the gymnastic exercises of ha\u1e6dha-yoga or the r\u0101ja-yoga system. But statements by the Lord Himself, such as v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti and m\u0101\u1e41 eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja, indicate that in mature transcendental realization one understands that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the source of everything and therefore the only worshipable object. Thus the devotees who worship the Deity of the Lord according to the pa\u00f1car\u0101tra system are not attracted by any yoga process except bhakti-yoga."

        "purport": " (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a) The Absolute Truth can never be understood by ordinary material sense perception. The conditioned souls engrossed in the vain pursuit of material sense gratification are completely indifferent to the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their materially conditioned minds are always impure and disturbed by the endless flow of material dualities, such as prosperity and poverty, winter and summer, fame and infamy, youth and old age. Such disturbed conditioned souls cannot recognize the personal presence of the Absolute Truth in the form of the Deity. The Lord\u2019s incarnation as arc\u0101-avat\u0101ra, the Deity form, is a special manifestation of the Lord\u2019s mercy toward the materialistic or neophyte devotees who are still under the influence of material designations. They are unable to perceive the Lord in His eternal abode, and therefore the Lord descends as the Deity form, manifesting the prak\u0101\u015ba incarnations and even the svaya\u1e41-prak\u0101\u015ba, or the original form of the Lord. The prak\u0101\u015ba incarnations exhibit various pastimes within this world, whereas svaya\u1e41-prak\u0101\u015ba, the Lord\u2019s original form, is the source of all avat\u0101ras. To one who sincerely worships the Deity, the Deity manifests Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are most unfortunate cannot even recognize the Supreme Lord in His merciful Deity expansion. They consider the Deity an ordinary material object. But by surrendering at the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master, who is a pure devotee of the Lord, one can learn to worship the Deity, as mentioned in this verse, and thus revive one\u2019s lost relationship with the Lord. One who considers such transcendental Deity worship to be equivalent to idol worship is grossly covered by the three modes of material nature. A person wearing rose-colored glasses sees the entire world to be rose colored. Similarly, those unfortunate living entities who are thickly covered by the material modes of nature see everything, including the Supreme Lord, as material due to their polluted vision."

One who is purified by worshiping the Deity form of the Lord can understand that he, the worshiper, is an eternal servant of the Lord and is qualitatively one with the Lord, being like a tiny spark of the original fire, the Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has stated in this regard: \u201cOne should think, \u2018I am an eternal servant of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and therefore, because I am His eternal part and parcel, I am eternally one with Him. But I am not Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Himself, because Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the supreme controller of everything.\u2019\u201d The basic principle of Deity worship is that one must understand oneself to be an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. One who is addicted to sexual gratification, foolishly identifying himself with the external material body, cannot change his conception of himself from that of an enjoyer to that of the enjoyed. Such a person interprets the word tan-mayam to mean that the worshiper is himself also the worshipable object. \u015ar\u012b J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b Prabhup\u0101da has written in his Durga-sa\u1e45gaman\u012b, his commentary on \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b Prabhu\u2019s Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu, that aha\u1e45grahop\u0101san\u0101, or the process of worshiping oneself as the Supreme, is a gross misidentification of one\u2019s own self with the Supreme, who is actually one\u2019s eternal shelter. The Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs have repeatedly clarified this point. But unintelligent persons within the pr\u0101k\u1e5bta-sahajiy\u0101 community become influenced by the bogus ideas of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers and thus display the deluded misconception that the worshiper becomes the supreme shelter. Such a hallucination is an apar\u0101dha, an offense against the Lord. Therefore the word tan-maya in this verse should not be offensively understood to mean that the worshiper becomes equal to his eternal worshipable object."
