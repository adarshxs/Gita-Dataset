Bathing should be done with water except if the Deity is made of clay, paint or wood, in which cases a thorough cleansing without water is enjoined.",
        "purport": " Various classes of devotees worship the Deity of the Personality of Godhead according to their various stages of faith in the Lord. An advanced devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a understands his eternal loving relationship with the Lord and, seeing the Deity as the Lord Himself, establishes an eternal relationship with the Deity based on loving servitude to Him. Understanding Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the eternal form of bliss and knowledge, a faithful devotee makes a permanent arrangement for Deity worship, installing the Lord\u2019s form made of, for example, stone, wood or marble. The \u015b\u0101lagr\u0101ma-\u015bil\u0101 is considered to be automatically installed even without the formal ceremony, and so it is forbidden to call the Deity with mantras or ask the Deity to leave. On the other hand, if one prepares a Deity form by drawing on sanctified ground or by constructing a sand image, one must call the Deity with mantras and then ask the Deity to leave the external form, which will soon be demolished by the natural elements. The general principle is that a pure devotee of the Lord understands his relationship with the Deity to be eternal. The more one surrenders in loving devotion to the Deity, the more one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a person, but He is the Supreme Person, possessing His own unique feelings. One can easily please the Lord by devotional service offered to His Deity form. By pleasing the Lord one can gradually progress in the mission of human life and eventually go back home, back to Godhead, where the Deity personally appears before the devotee and welcomes the devotee to His personal abode, known throughout the world as the kingdom of God."

In this world Ga\u1e47e\u015ba, the son of Lord \u015aiva, is famous for awarding financial success, and the goddess Durg\u0101, the wife of Lord \u015aiva, is famous as the external, illusory potency of the Supreme Lord. The personalities mentioned here, however, are eternally liberated associates of the Lord who reside in the spiritual sky, beyond the material manifestation. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b quotes from various Vedic literatures to prove that the name Durg\u0101 may also indicate the internal potency of the Lord, who is nondifferent from Him. The external, or covering, potency of the Lord expands from this original Durg\u0101. The Durg\u0101 of the material world, called Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, assumes the function of bewildering the living entities. Thus a devotee should not fear becoming polluted by worshiping the Durg\u0101 mentioned here, who has the same name as illusion, but rather the devotee must show respect to these eternal servitors of the Supreme Lord in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha."

        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped according to the faith of a particular worshiper. The Deity form, arc\u0101, is specifically mentioned here because Deity worship is essential for spiritual progress. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura mentions that inexperienced persons may think that the Deity is meant for the sense gratification of the worshiper, since superficially the Deity is made of external substances such as marble or brass. But through the process of installing the Deity by chanting of authorized mantras, one invites the Supreme Personality of Godhead to enter the Deity form. By regulated, faithful worship one gradually understands that the Deity is completely nondifferent from the Supreme Lord Himself. At that stage, on the strength of Deity worship, one rises to the second-class platform of devotional service. At this more developed stage one desires to make friendship with other devotees of the Lord, and as one becomes solidly established in the community of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, one completely gives up material life and gradually becomes perfect in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."
