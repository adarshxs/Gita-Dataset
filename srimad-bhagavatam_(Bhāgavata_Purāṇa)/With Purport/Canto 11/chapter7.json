        "purport": " Each and every demigod has his particular abode in the heavenly planets within the material universe. Although Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is sometimes counted among the demigods, His abode is in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, the spiritual sky. The demigods are universal controllers within the kingdom of m\u0101y\u0101, but Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Lord of the illusory potency and many other spiritual potencies. His exalted residence does not lie within the kingdom of His insignificant maidservant m\u0101y\u0101. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Personality of Godhead, is the Supreme Lord of all lords; the demigods are His separated parts and parcels. Being themselves minute j\u012bva souls, the demigods are under the influence of the potency of m\u0101y\u0101; but Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is always the supreme controller of m\u0101y\u0101. The Personality of Godhead is the reservoir and root of all existence, and the material world is just a dim reflection of the brilliant scenery of His eternal, spiritual abode, where everything is infinitely beautiful and pleasurable. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the supreme reality, and no living entity can ever be equal to or greater than Him. The Lord exists within His own unique category called vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All other prominent or extraordinary living entities owe their positions and potencies to the Lord. Ultimately Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Himself is a plenary expansion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the original source of all the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva and j\u012bva-tattva expansions. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the basis of everything."

Nevertheless, all external approaches to this transcendental city were covered by the ocean, and thus the Lord\u2019s abode remains inaccessible to foolish persons in Kali-yuga, as will be described later in this canto. By the Lord\u2019s mystic potency, called yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, He reveals His own form, abode, paraphernalia, pastimes, entourage, and so on, and at the suitable time He removes all of these from our mundane sight. Although bewildered conditioned souls may doubt the spiritual potency of the Lord, the pure devotees can directly perceive and relish His transcendental appearance and disappearance, which are described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as janma karma ca me divyam. If one faithfully accepts this perfect knowledge of the Lord\u2019s transcendental nature, then surely one will go back home, back to Godhead, and become an eternal companion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plan was to bring Uddhava back to His own eternal abode after a brief delay. Because of Uddhava\u2019s extraordinary spiritual qualities, the Lord wanted to engage him in propagating His message among other saintly persons who were not yet advanced to the stage of pure devotional service. However, the Lord assured Uddhava that he would not be bereft of the Lord\u2019s association for even a moment. Also, because Uddhava had become a perfect master of his senses, he would never be afflicted by the three modes of material nature. In this way, before bringing Uddhava back home, back to Godhead, the Lord empowered him to carry out a specific confidential mission. Wherever the supreme position of the Personality of Godhead is not recognized, useless mental speculation becomes very prominent, and the safe and sure path of hearing perfect Vedic knowledge becomes covered by the chaos of mental concoction. At the present time, especially in the Western countries, literally millions of books are being published on hundreds and thousands of subjects; yet despite this proliferation of mental concoction people remain totally in ignorance about the most fundamental issues of human life, namely, Who am I? Where have I come from? Where am I going? What is my soul? What is God? The Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the reservoir of innumerable enchanting pastimes, and thus He is the source of innumerable varieties of pleasure. In fact, He is the ocean of eternal pleasure. When the eternal soul is bereft of the constitutional pleasure that comes from loving service to the Lord, he is overwhelmed and bewildered by material nature. He helplessly chases after material sense gratification, thinking that one material object is good and another bad, and constantly changes his assessment of what is good and what is bad. Thus he derives no peace or pleasure, is in constant anxiety and is repeatedly thrashed by the cruel laws of nature in the form of birth, death, old age and disease. In this way the conditioned soul becomes a fit candidate to take birth in Kali-yuga, which is the epitome of misfortune. In Kali-yuga the living entities, who are already suffering so many tribulations, mercilessly turn against one another. Human society in Kali-yuga becomes savagely violent, and men open slaughterhouses to butcher hundreds of millions of innocent creatures. Large-scale wars are declared, and millions of human beings, even women and children, are quickly annihilated. Unless the living entity recognizes the authority of the Personality of Godhead, he remains a helpless victim in the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, or material illusion. He concocts different solutions to release himself from m\u0101y\u0101, but these solutions are themselves creations of m\u0101y\u0101 and thus cannot possibly release the conditioned soul. In fact, they only intensify his distress. In the next verse, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a specifically warns Uddhava to avoid Kali-yuga and go back home, back to Godhead. Those of us who have already taken birth in Kali-yuga should also heed this advice and immediately take all necessary steps to go back to the Lord\u2019s eternal abode for a blissful life of perfect knowledge. The material world is never a happy place, especially during the fearful days of Kali-yuga."

Heedless of the authority of the Personality of Godhead, the fallen souls of Kali-yuga become engulfed in bitter quarrel and cruelly harass one another. Because people in Kali-yuga are addicted to polluted, sinful activities, they are always angry, lusty and frustrated. In Kali-yuga the devotees of the Personality of Godhead, who are engaged in the ever-increasing loving service of the Lord, should never be attracted to living on the earth, the population of which is covered in the darkness of ignorance and devoid of any loving relationship with the Lord. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advised Uddhava not to remain on the earth in Kali-yuga. In fact, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord advises all living entities that they should never remain anywhere within the material universe \u2014 during any age. Therefore every living being should take advantage of the pressures of Kali-yuga to understand the overall useless nature of the material world and surrender himself at the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Following in the footsteps of \u015ar\u012b Uddhava, one should surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and go back home, back to Godhead."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bmad V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya has explained the concept of equal vision as follows: sama-d\u1e5bk sarvasya brahm\u0101tmakatv\u0101nusandh\u0101na-r\u016bpa-sama-d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dim\u0101n. \u201cOne who is on the path of self-realization should always endeavor to see the ultimate spiritual nature of all existence.\u201d The word mayi in this verse means param\u0101tmani. One should fix one\u2019s mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the source of everything. Thus as one passes one\u2019s life on the earth, using up one\u2019s allotted time, one should practice seeing all things and all people as part and parcel of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. Since all living entities are part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, ultimately they all have the same spiritual status. The material nature, also being an emanation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has a similar spiritual status, but although matter and spirit are both emanations from the Personality of Godhead, they do not exist exactly on the same level. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that the spirit soul is the superior energy of the Lord, whereas the material nature is His inferior energy. However, since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is equally present in all things, the word sama-d\u1e5bk in this verse indicates that one must ultimately see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within everything and everything within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus equal vision is compatible with mature knowledge of the varieties present within this world. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments as follows on this verse. \u201cAt the end of His manifest pastimes on the earth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, thought as follows within His mind: \u2018During My pastimes on the earth, I have satisfied the desires of all those devotees who anxiously desired to see Me. I have duly married many thousands of queens, headed by Rukmi\u1e47\u012b, whom I personally kidnapped, and I have killed innumerable demons in various places and by various means. I have attended meetings, reunions and ceremonies with many friends, relatives and well-wishers in cities such as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Mathur\u0101, Dv\u0101rak\u0101, Hastin\u0101pura and Mithil\u0101, and thus I have kept constantly busy coming and going in the performance of pastimes. \u201c\u2018I further arranged to give My personal association to great devotees who are situated below the earthly planet. In order to please My mother Devak\u012b and return her six deceased sons who were killed by Ka\u1e41sa, I descended to the planet Sutala and blessed My great devotee Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. In order to return the dead son of My spiritual master, S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni, I personally went to the court of Ravinandana, or Yamar\u0101ja, and thus he was able to see Me face to face. I even blessed the residents of heaven, such as mother Aditi and Ka\u015byapa Muni, with My personal association when I traveled there to steal the p\u0101rij\u0101ta flower for My wife Satyabh\u0101m\u0101. And in order to please the inhabitants of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s abode, such as Nanda, Sunanda and Sudar\u015bana, I traveled to Mah\u0101-Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka to recover the deceased children of a frustrated br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Thus, innumerable devotees who ardently desired to see Me have received the object of their prayers. \u201c\u2018Unfortunately Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u1e5a\u1e63i and the great paramaha\u1e41sa sages who live with Him in Badarik\u0101\u015brama, although most enthusiastic to see Me, never had their desire fulfilled. I have been on the earth for 125 years, and the scheduled time is now up. Being busily engaged in My pastimes, I did not have time to give My blessings to these great sages. Nevertheless, Uddhava is practically the same as Me. He is a great devotee and shares My own transcendental opulences. Thus, he is the right person for Me to send to Badarik\u0101\u015brama. I shall give Uddhava complete transcendental knowledge by which one becomes detached from the material world, and he in turn can deliver this knowledge, the science of transcending the kingdom of illusion, to the worthy sages at Badarik\u0101\u015brama. In this way he can teach them the method of rendering loving devotional service to My lotus feet. Such loving devotional service rendered to Me is the most valuable treasure, and by hearing such knowledge the desires of the great sages such as Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a will be completely fulfilled. \u201c\u2018Those great souls who have surrendered unto Me are always equipped with transcendental knowledge and detachment from the material world. Sometimes, being busy in their devotional service, they may appear to forget Me. However, a pure devotee who has achieved the platform of love for Me will always be protected by such sincere devotion. Even if such a devotee should suddenly give up his life while neglecting to fix his mind intensely on Me, such a devotee\u2019s loving feelings are so powerful that they afford him all protection. Even if there is a temporary moment of forgetfulness, such devotion will bring the devotee to My lotus feet, which are beyond the vision of ordinary, materialistic persons. Uddhava is My pure devotee. Knowledge of Me and detachment from this world have again been aroused in him because he can never give up My association.\u2019\u201d The sincere servants of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu are vigorously endeavoring to spread this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement for the pleasure of their spiritual master and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. At the present time thousands of devotees in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, in all parts of the world, are working long hours under difficult conditions to distribute transcendental literature and thus enlighten the general populace. In this effort the devotees have no personal motivation but are simply desirous of pleasing their spiritual master by distributing his books. The people who receive this literature usually have no previous experience of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, yet they are so impressed by the purity of the devotees they meet that they eagerly purchase the books and magazines. In order to execute the tremendous task of spreading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotees are tirelessly laboring day and night because they are on the platform of loving devotion. Although superficially such busy devotees may occasionally not think directly of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, such loving devotion will undoubtedly take them back to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet, and being pleased by their service, the Lord Himself will again arouse their unflinching meditation upon His personal form. This is the beauty of bhakti-yoga, which depends wholly and solely on the mercy of the all-merciful Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the only totally safe means of uprooting the deep desires for material enjoyment, attaining pure love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and going beyond the material universe to the kingdom of God. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.40): Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also advised Uddhava in this verse to give up the illusory attachment to so-called friends and family within this material world. One may not be able to physically give up association with family and friends, but one should understand that everyone and everything is part and parcel of God and is meant for the pleasure of God. As soon as one thinks, \u201cThis is my personal family,\u201d immediately one will see the material world as no more than a place for enjoying family life. As soon as one is attached to one\u2019s so-called family, false prestige and material possessiveness arise. Actually, everyone is part and parcel of God and therefore, on the spiritual platform, related to all other entities. This is called k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sambandha, or the constitutional relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is not possible to advance to the highest stage of spiritual awareness and at the same time maintain a petty material concept of society, friendship and love. One should experience all relationships on the higher, spiritual platform of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sambandha, which means seeing everything in relation to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. One who is situated in his constitutional relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can see all things in relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He thus gives up the mundane urges of the body, mind and speech and travels throughout the earth as a devotee of the Lord. Such a highly elevated personality is called gosv\u0101m\u012b, or the master of the senses. This stage is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54) by the words brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101: on the spiritual platform one attains complete satisfaction."

In fact, you should know that all of the objects of the material senses are temporary.",
        "purport": " The question may be raised that since we find good and bad qualities throughout the material world, how can Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advise Uddhava to see everything equally? In this verse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains that material good and evil are a creation of the illusory energy, just as the objects of a dream are a mental creation. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually everything because He is present within everything and everything is present within Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram, the Lord and proprietor of all worlds. To see anything separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is illusion, and attraction to any kind of material illusion, either good or bad, is ultimately useless since it obliges the living entity to continue wandering in the cycle of birth and death. Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching constitute the activities of the five knowledge-gathering senses. Similarly, the voice, the hands, the legs, the anus and the genitals constitute the five working senses. These ten senses are organized around the mind, which is the center of material activity. When the living entity desires to exploit matter, he is covered by the three modes of nature. Thus he concocts different philosophical, political and social explanations of reality but never understands the Absolute Truth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is beyond the contaminated perception of the material senses. One who is entangled in the network of material designations, such as race, nationality, sectarian religion, political affiliation, etc., is absorbed in the experience of combining his body and other bodies with material sense objects, thinking these sense objects to be sources of happiness and satisfaction. Unfortunately, the entire material world, along with the senses that experience it, is a temporary creation that will be annihilated by the time potency of the Supreme Lord. Despite our foolish hopes and dreams, there is no actual happiness on the material platform. The real truth is not material, nor is it temporary. The real truth is called \u0101tm\u0101, or the eternal soul, and among all eternal souls one is supreme. He is called the Personality of Godhead, and in His original form He is known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The knowledge-gathering process culminates in perception of the inconceivable, transcendental form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who is not perceiving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in everything and everything in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is undoubtedly on the platform of mental concoction. In this verse Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a warns Uddhava to remain clear of this illusory platform of existence."

        "translation": "One whose consciousness is bewildered by illusion perceives many differences in value and meaning among material objects. Thus one engages constantly on the platform of material good and evil and is bound by such conceptions. Absorbed in material duality, such a person contemplates the performance of compulsory duties, nonperformance of such duties and performance of forbidden activities.",
        "purport": " The illusory mental platform of existence is described in this verse. The word ayuktasya indicates the conditioned soul who does not fix his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is clearly described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and other Vedic literature that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Absolute Truth, is within everything, and everything is within the Lord. The example may be given that when a woman loves a man, she is most eager to see him, and she daily sees him dressed in different clothes. Actually the woman is interested not in the clothes but in the man. Similarly, within every material object is the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore one who has developed love of God is constantly seeing the Lord everywhere, and not just the superficial material objects that cover the Lord. The word ayuktasya in this verse indicates one who has not come to the stage of reality. Such a person, being deprived of loving devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, attempts to enjoy the innumerable forms and flavors of material experience. This temporary, illusory engagement is not the constitutional function of the bewildered living entity, who remains without any awareness of the ultimate reality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Within the world of matter there are undoubtedly varieties. Among dogs there are pedigree poodles and common mutts, and among horses there are thoroughbreds and old gray mares. Similarly, some human beings are beautiful and educated and others are dull and homely. Some are rich and some are poor. In nature we find fertile land and sterile land, lush forests and useless deserts, invaluable gems and colorless stones, flowing transparent rivers and stagnant dirty ponds. In human society we find happiness and distress, love and hate, victory and defeat, war and peace, life and death, and so on. However, we do not have any permanent relationship with any of these conditions, because we are eternal spirit souls, part and parcel of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic culture is arranged in such a way that everyone can become perfect in self-realization simply by performing his occupational duty for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sve sve karma\u1e47y abhirata\u1e25 sa\u1e41siddhi\u1e41 labhate nara\u1e25. Some conditioned souls, however, believe that complete perfection in life may be achieved by performing ordinary, nonspiritual duties on behalf of family, nation, humanity, and so on. Others are interested in neither service to God nor noble mundane activities, and there are others who actively pursue sinful life. Such sinful persons generally rise from bed late in the afternoon and stay awake all night, taking intoxicants and engaging in illicit sex. Such a dark, hellish existence is caused by attraction to tamo-gu\u1e47a, the mode of ignorance. Actions in the mode of ignorance are called vikarma, as mentioned in this verse. Unfortunately, neither the materially responsible person nor the materially irresponsible person nor the sinful person can achieve the real perfection of life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Although different societies and different individuals maintain different concepts of good and evil, all material things are ultimately useless in terms of our eternal self-interest, which is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This idea is expressed by the saintly King Citraketu in the Sixth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (6.17.20): \u201cThis material world resembles the waves of a constantly flowing river. Therefore, what is a curse and what is a favor? What are the heavenly planets and what are the hellish planets? What is actually happiness and what is actually distress? Because the waves flow constantly, none of them has an eternal effect.\u201d The argument may be given that since in the Vedas there are prescribed and forbidden activities, the Vedas also accept the concept of good and evil within the material world. The fact is, however, that it is not the Vedas themselves but the conditioned souls who are bound up in material duality. The function of Vedic literature is to engage each individual at the particular level on which he is presently situated and gradually elevate him to the perfection of life. The material mode of goodness is not itself spiritual, but it does not impede spiritual life. Since the material mode of goodness purifies one\u2019s consciousness and creates a hankering for higher knowledge, it is a favorable platform from which to pursue spiritual life, just as the airport is a favorable place from which to travel. If a man desires to travel from New York to London, the New York airport is certainly the most favorable place from which to travel. But if the man misses his plane, he is no closer to London than anyone in New York who did not go to the airport. In other words, the advantage of the airport is meaningful only if one catches his plane. Similarly, the material mode of goodness is the most favorable situation from which to move up to the spiritual platform. The Vedas prescribe and forbid various activities to lift the conditioned soul to the material mode of goodness, and from that point he should rise to the spiritual platform by transcendental knowledge. Therefore if one does not come to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his elevation to the material mode of goodness is useless, just as a trip to the airport is useless for one who misses his plane. In the Vedas there are injunctions and prohibitions that appear to accept good and evil among material things, but the ultimate purpose of the Vedic regulations is to create a favorable situation for spiritual life. If one can immediately take to spiritual life then there is no need to waste time with rituals within the modes of nature. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises Arjuna in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.45): \u201cThe Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self.\u201d In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted the following verses from Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata: \u201cWithin the material world, the conditioned souls consider residence on the heavenly planets and celestial pleasures, such as the pious enjoyment of beautiful women, to be good and desirable things. Similarly, painful or miserable conditions are considered to be evil or bad. However, all such perception of good and bad in the material world is undoubtedly based upon the fundamental mistake of considering oneself, and not the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be the ultimate doer or performer of all actions.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, a person who knows that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the actual controller of material nature, and that it is ultimately He who is moving everything, can free himself from the bondage of material existence. Such a person goes to the abode of the Lord.\u201d"

        "translation": "Therefore, bringing all your senses under control and thus subduing the mind, you should see the entire world as situated within the self, who is expanded everywhere, and you should also see this individual self within Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " The word vitatam, or \u201cwidely expanded,\u201d implies that the individual j\u012bva soul is present throughout the material universe. Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.24) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states, nitya\u1e25 sarva-gata\u1e25: the individual soul is eternal and is expanded everywhere throughout the material and spiritual worlds. This does not mean, however, that each individual soul is all-pervading, but that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has expanded His marginal potency everywhere. Thus, one should not blindly conclude that a minute living entity is all-pervading; rather, one should understand that God is great and expands His personal energy everywhere. In this verse, \u0101tman\u012bk\u1e63asva vitatam means that this material world is created to facilitate the sense gratification of the conditioned souls, who are trying to enjoy without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, their actual master. The living entities are busily trying to exploit the external energy of the Lord, but their jurisdiction over the material world is illusory. Both the material nature and the conditioned living being are energies of the Lord and thus exist within the Personality of Godhead and are under His supreme control. The individual living entity exists for the pleasure of the Personality of Godhead and is the Lord\u2019s eternal servant. As soon as the senses become absorbed in material gratification they lose their power to experience the Absolute Truth. The actual goal of sense activity is satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Lord, and all of the senses can experience infinite spiritual pleasure by perceiving and serving the Lord in His personal feature. Those who adopt the impersonal conception of God, however, try to stop all sense activity. But because the senses cannot remain permanently inactive they naturally return to activities in the realm of material illusion. If one engages the senses in the service of the Personality of Godhead, then one enjoys unlimited pleasure upon seeing the transcendental beauty of the Lord\u2019s form. But unless one qualifies himself by pure loving devotion to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord does not award him this exalted experience. Therefore, every conditioned soul should end his unnecessary separation from the Personality of Godhead by rejoining the Lord\u2019s blissful company. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally comes down to reopen the blind eyes of the conditioned souls, and thus the Lord is personally teaching Uddhava so that sincere souls in the future might take advantage of His instructions. Indeed, hundreds and millions of people even now derive spiritual enlightenment from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions to Arjuna in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."

The demigods themselves are humble servants of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as was amply demonstrated in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes on the earth. One who can experience the eternal soul within everyone\u2019s body certainly becomes dear to all living beings.

        "purport": " One who has developed transcendental knowledge never acts whimsically. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes two stages of devotional service: s\u0101dhana-bhakti and r\u0101g\u0101nuga-bhakti. R\u0101g\u0101nuga-bhakti is the stage of spontaneous love of Godhead, whereas s\u0101dhana-bhakti means the conscientious practice of the regulative principles of devotional service. In most cases, one who is now enjoying transcendental consciousness has rigidly practiced the rules and regulations of devotional service. Thus, due to previous practice, one spontaneously avoids sinful life and acts in accordance with the standards of ordinary piety. This does not mean that a self-realized soul is consciously avoiding sin and pursuing piety. Rather, due to his self-realized nature, he spontaneously engages in the most exalted spiritual activities, just as an innocent child may spontaneously exhibit good qualities such as kindness, tolerance, and so on. The spiritual platform is called \u015buddha-sattva, or purified goodness, to distinguish it from the material mode of goodness, which is always to some extent polluted by the lower modes of passion and ignorance. Thus if a man in material goodness appears to be most pious in the eyes of the world, we can only imagine the spotless character of a self-realized soul in purified spiritual goodness. Therefore it is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.18.12): If one is a pure devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will automatically exhibit all the exalted qualities of the demigods. Such manifestation of purity is spontaneous, as explained in this verse."

Thus You are the Supreme Soul who is realized through yoga, and it is You who are the origin of all mystic power. For my supreme benefit You have explained the procedure for giving up the material world through the process of sanny\u0101sa, or renunciation.",
        "purport": " The word yoge\u015ba here indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead awards the results of all yoga practices. Since all of the material and spiritual worlds emanate from the transcendental body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is nothing to be achieved by any yoga process except K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His potencies. And since the Lord remains eternally the master of His potencies, no one can achieve anything through yoga, or any other spiritual or material process, except by the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word yoga means \u201clinking up,\u201d and unless we link ourselves with the Absolute Truth, we remain covered by the darkness of ignorance. Thus, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the goal of yoga. In the material world we falsely try to link ourselves with the objects of the senses. Man wants to link with woman and woman with man, or one tries to link up with nationalism, socialism, capitalism or innumerable other creations of the illusory energy of the Lord. Since we are linking ourselves to temporary objects the relationships are temporary, the results are temporary, and at the time of death we become bewildered when all of our connections are suddenly cut off by m\u0101y\u0101. If we link ourselves to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, our relationship with Him will continue even after death. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that we develop in this life will continue to increase in our next life until we achieve the supreme goal of entering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s planet. Those who sincerely serve the mission of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, following the transcendental lifestyle prescribed by the Lord, will enter the Lord\u2019s abode at the end of this lifetime. One can never achieve a permanent situation by mental speculation, and what to speak of by ordinary material sense gratification. By the methods of ha\u1e6dha-yoga, karma-yoga, r\u0101ja-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, etc., one does not actually awaken his propensity for rendering eternal loving service to the Personality of Godhead. Thus, one is bereft of the transcendental tastes of spiritual enjoyment. Sometimes the conditioned soul, disgusted by his failure to gratify his senses, bitterly decides to renounce the material world and merge into an impersonal, painless transcendence. But our actual happy situation is to render loving service at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. All of the different yoga processes gradually lead one to love of Godhead, and it is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s aim to reestablish the conditioned souls in this happy position. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is making this perfection easily available through the chanting of the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme yoga process for this age."

Indeed, all of the demigods, headed by Lord Brahm\u0101, are bewildered by Your illusory potency.

        "purport": " All conditioned souls, from Lord Brahm\u0101 down to the insignificant ant, are declared by \u015ar\u012b Uddhava to be covered by material bodies produced by the illusory potency of the Lord. The demigods in heaven, being absorbed in universal management, constantly utilize their fabulous material potencies. They therefore gradually fix their minds upon their mystically empowered bodies and also upon their bodily expansions such as their celestial wives, children, co-workers and friends. In the course of life in the heavenly planets, the demigods become conditioned to think in terms of material good and bad, and thus they accept the immediate welfare of their bodies to be the highest goal of life. The demigods do, however, try to strictly follow the laws of God. And to help them do this, the Supreme Lord descends to remind the heavenly beings of His own supreme personality, which possesses powers infinitely exceeding theirs. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has an eternal body, full of bliss, knowledge and unlimited variegated potencies, whereas the demigods possess only deluxe material forms, subject to birth, death, old age and disease. Because the demigods are attached to ruling the created universe, their devotion to God is tinged with material desires. They are therefore attracted to those portions of Vedic knowledge that award the various material opulences necessary for perpetuating their celestial life. \u015ar\u012b Uddhava, however, being a pure devotee of the Lord, is determined to go back home, back to Godhead, for eternal life and is thus not at all interested in the sophisticated Vedic knowledge of the demigods. The material world is a gigantic prison, whose inmates are subjected to birth, death, old age and illusion, and a pure devotee has no desire to remain there even as a first-class prisoner, like the demigods. \u015ar\u012b Uddhava desires to return to the kingdom of God and for this reason directly approaches the Personality of Godhead. The Lord is sva-d\u1e5b\u015ba\u1e25, or one who reveals Himself to His devotee. Thus, only the Lord Himself or His pure devotee, who faithfully repeats the Lord\u2019s message, can take one beyond the material sky into the free atmosphere of the spiritual planets, where the liberated souls enjoy an eternal life of bliss and omniscience."

In fact, You are known as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the true friend of all living beings.",
        "purport": " No one can claim to be a self-made man, because everyone works with the body and mind awarded by material nature. By the laws of nature there is always anxiety in material existence, and terrible tragedies periodically harass the conditioned souls. Here Uddhava points out that only \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, is a proper master, friend and shelter for the conditioned souls. We may be attracted by the good qualities of a particular man or demigod, but we may later discover discrepancies in that person\u2019s behavior. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as anavadyam. There are no discrepancies in the personal conduct or character of the Personality of Godhead; He is eternally faultless. We may faithfully serve a master, father or demigod, but when it is time for us to receive our reward for faithful service, the master may die. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is here described as ananta-p\u0101ram, which indicates that He is not limited by time or space. The word anta indicates the termination of time, and p\u0101ra indicates a spatial termination; therefore ananta-p\u0101ram means that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not limited by time or space and thus will always dutifully reward His faithful servants. If we serve someone other than the Personality of Godhead, our so-called master may forget our service or become ungrateful. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described here as sarva-j\u00f1am, omniscient. He can never forget the service of His devotee, and therefore He is never ungrateful. In fact, it is said that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not remember the faults of His devotees but only the sincere service they have rendered. A further disadvantage in serving anyone besides K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is that when we are in danger our master may not be able to protect us. If we take shelter of our nation, that nation may be destroyed in war. If we take shelter of our family, they may also die. And as described in the Vedic literature, even the demigods are sometimes defeated by the demons. But since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described here as \u012b\u015bvara, or the supreme controller, there is no danger of His being overcome or even impeded by any other power. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s promise of protection to His devotee is eternally valid. If we do not serve the Personality of Godhead, we will not know the ultimate result of our service. But here Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as aku\u1e47\u1e6dha-viku\u1e47\u1e6dha-dhi\u1e63\u1e47yam. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has an eternal abode called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, and that abode is never disturbed by anything. The faithful servants of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will certainly go back to Godhead, back home, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in the personal abode of the Lord. However, since even the demigods, and what to speak of insignificant human beings, are subject sooner or later to annihilation, what ultimate benefit can be derived from serving them? Uddhava describes his personal situation as nirvi\u1e47\u1e47a-dh\u012b\u1e25 and v\u1e5bjin\u0101bhitapta\u1e25. In other words, \u015ar\u012b Uddhava states that he is exhausted and discouraged by the contradictions and anguish of material life. He has been forced, therefore, to become humble and surrender to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the personal friend of every living entity. In the material world a great man does not have time for insignificant men. But although the Lord is the greatest person, He sits in the heart of every living entity; thus He is the most merciful. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate shelter of even N\u0101ra, or the Lord\u2019s puru\u1e63a expansion who creates the material world. The living entity is called nara, and the source of his material situation is N\u0101ra, or Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The word n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a indicates that even Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u finds His shelter in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is certainly supreme. Although our consciousness is presently contaminated by sinful propensities, if we follow the example of \u015ar\u012b Uddhava and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, everything can be rectified. Taking shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means taking shelter of devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and obeying Him. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a demands this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and if we comply with the order of the Lord our life can become fully auspicious and successful. Sooner than we expect, we may, by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy, enter the kingdom of God for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012b Uddhava expressed to the Lord in the previous verses his fallen condition and his entanglement in the material concept of life. Now Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reassures Uddhava that even persons far less qualified than Uddhava are able to extricate themselves from the inauspicious life of material sense gratification. According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, even if one has not received the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, one can understand by direct and indirect analysis that the material world is not a place of enjoyment. Direct analysis means one\u2019s personal experience and indirect analysis means hearing and reading of the experience of others. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered Uddhava to be more intelligent than even the demigods in heaven. Uddhava, however, was feeling discouraged, thinking himself unqualified to render devotional service to the Lord. But Uddhava was actually perfectly situated because he had achieved Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his personal spiritual master. Similarly, the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement are guided by the instructions of the Society\u2019s founder-\u0101c\u0101rya, O\u1e41 Vi\u1e63\u1e47up\u0101da Paramaha\u1e41sa Parivr\u0101jak\u0101c\u0101rya A\u1e63\u1e6dottara-\u015bata \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bmad A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da. Therefore, a sincere member of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement should never feel discouraged but should rather count his blessings and do the needful to go back home, back to Godhead. Within the material world, certain activities are auspicious and produce happiness, whereas other activities, being sinful, are inauspicious and cause unlimited suffering. Even one who has not yet received the complete mercy of the bona fide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious spiritual master should conclude by sharp intelligence that there is no happiness in ordinary, material life and that real self-interest lies beyond the material platform. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya points out that even if one is expert not only in material knowledge but also in spiritual knowledge, one will enter into the darkness of ignorance if one neglects the association of the devotees of the Lord. Therefore, one should not misinterpret this verse in a way that minimizes the significance of the pure devotee spiritual master. One who is vicak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101\u1e25, or expert, will eventually come to understand the difference between matter and spirit. Such a person will certainly recognize and appreciate a genuine spiritual master. One who is advanced in knowledge undoubtedly becomes humble, and thus an expert advanced human will never neglect the lotus feet of the pure devotees of the Lord."

Thus, in human life the soul may speak realized knowledge, see the truth, know the future and also understand the reality both of this world and of the next. Taking advantage of the experience of mortal life, the soul in human form may endeavor for immortality, and the human body is fully equipped to achieve this end. In such an elevated state the soul is certainly well acquainted with the ordinary activities of animals, such as eating and drinking.\u201d The human form of life (puru\u1e63atve) is very significant because it affords us the opportunity to perfect our existence. The S\u0101\u1e45khya system mentioned here is best illustrated by the instructions of Lord Kapila to His mother, Devah\u016bti. Lord Kapila is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His mother approached Him, saying: \u201cI am very sick of the disturbance caused by my material senses, for because of this sense disturbance, my Lord, I have fallen into the abyss of ignorance.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.25.7) Lord Kapila delivered to His mother a highly analytical summary of all material and spiritual reality. It is significant that Lord Kapila did not discriminate against His mother because she was a woman, nor did He consider her incapable of understanding the most elaborate spiritual knowledge. Thus, in a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious society of liberated souls, any man, woman or child may become a great devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without discrimination. It is also significant that in the highly intellectual S\u0101\u1e45khya system enunciated by Lord Kapila, the solid conclusion is surrender to the lotus feet of the pure devotees and love of Godhead. In Lord Kapila\u2019s instructions in the Third Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, He emphasizes the need to take shelter of the pure devotees of the Lord. In the present verse Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga-vi\u015b\u0101rad\u0101\u1e25: those who are expert in taking shelter of the pure devotees and who can thus understand the actual situation of this world are able to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His personal form, along with His internal and external potencies. A spiritual master becomes bona fide by his full surrender to his spiritual master; but as explained in this chapter, one may also act as his own guru. This means that an intelligent and perceptive person can understand the nature of this world and his own limitations. Such a person then becomes very much inclined to associate with the pure devotees of the Lord and to receive the mercy of those who are advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga, as described here, refers to the rigorous intellectual progress of the j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga system, along with the devotion of bhakti-yoga, which emphasizes the mercy of the lotus feet of the pure devotees. Actually, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is a factor in the bhakti-yoga system, since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is j\u00f1\u0101na-gamya, or the goal of all knowledge. The Lord also says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10) that He personally enlightens a sincere devotee with all knowledge. In this chapter, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is training Uddhava to see the Lord\u2019s personal form in the course of his daily experiences in the material world. The Lord has already indicated to Uddhava that he will travel throughout the world in sam\u0101dhi, or trance, and now Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is preparing Uddhava to travel as a true sanny\u0101s\u012b seeing the Personality of Godhead everywhere."

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the word yukt\u0101\u1e25 in this verse indicates those engaged in the regulative practice of bhakti-yoga. The devotees of the Lord do not abandon their intelligence and become mindless fanatics, as some fools think. As indicated by the words anum\u0101nata\u1e25 and gu\u1e47air li\u1e45gai\u1e25, a devotee engaged in bhakti-yoga intensely searches out the Personality of Godhead through all of the rational faculties of the human brain. The word m\u1e5bgayanti, or \u201csearching,\u201d does not, however, indicate an unregulated or unauthorized process. If we are searching for the telephone number of a particular person, we look in the authorized telephone directory. Similarly, if we are searching for a particular product, we go to a specialized store where we are likely to find what we are looking for. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b points out that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not a product of the imagination, and thus we cannot whimsically imagine what the Lord might be. Therefore, to gain information about Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one must conduct a regulated search in the authorized Vedic scriptures. The word agr\u0101hyam in this verse indicates that no one can achieve or understand Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by ordinary speculation or through the activities of the material senses. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b states the following verse in the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.234): \u201cNo one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality and pastimes of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through his materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him.\u201d The words g\u1e5bhyam\u0101\u1e47air gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 indicate the rational and intellectual faculties of the human brain. All of these can be used to directly and indirectly perceive the Personality of Godhead. Indirectly one may experience the Lord through His creation. Since we are experiencing this world through our intelligence (and senses), we may conclude that our own intelligence must have a creator and that creator is therefore supremely intelligent. Thus, through simple logic any sane person can understand that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead who is controlling everything. One may also directly perceive the Lord through chanting and hearing His holy names and glories. \u015arava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 means that one should always chant and hear of the glories of the Lord. One who perfectly hears and chants will undoubtedly see the Lord face to face. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all-pervading, and one should search for Him everywhere. By the transcendental senses, purified by bhakti-yoga, one may directly perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As indicated by the word addh\u0101 in this verse, this perception is direct and not imaginary. This point has been elaborately explained by \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da in his purport to this verse from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.2.35): \u201cThe Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is in every living being along with the individual soul, and this fact is perceived and hypothesized in our acts of seeing and taking help from the intelligence.\u201d"

        "purport": " Ignorant persons often think that renounced spiritual life is meant for those who are impotent or homely or incompetent in practical worldly affairs. Sometimes foolish people say that religious life is a crutch for those who are not expert enough to achieve a high status in society. Therefore King Yadu has described the qualities of the mendicant br\u0101hma\u1e47a in order to show that the br\u0101hma\u1e47a has taken to renounced spiritual life in spite of great potential for worldly success. The avadh\u016bta br\u0101hma\u1e47a is described as being expert, learned, good-looking, eloquent and in every sense qualified to be a great material success. Still, the avadh\u016bta has renounced material life and taken to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Going back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge is the real work of a human being. The followers of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu simultaneously cultivate their own K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and strenuously endeavor in missionary work to help others become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Often foolish persons deride the devotees by saying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a job?\u201d They think that one who is sincerely endeavoring for spiritual enlightenment and who is also enlightening others is not doing anything practical. Foolish materialists will pay millions of dollars to extend their lives by a few weeks or months in a hospital, but they do not appreciate someone endeavoring for eternal life. There is no actual logic in material life. The act of trying to enjoy without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is in itself the culmination of irrationality, and thus we cannot expect to find anything ultimately rational or logical in a materialistic life devoid of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Many devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a come from wealthy, learned and influential families, and they take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in order to perfect their lives, and certainly not due to lack of opportunity for material advancement. Although sometimes persons in material distress approach the Supreme Lord for help in material life, a real devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a voluntarily gives up all types of material enjoyment, knowing that nothing but love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and service to His lotus feet are the actual perfection of life."

        "purport": " The natural result of transcendental bliss is described in this verse. The young br\u0101hma\u1e47a was physically very attractive, and his senses were full of potency for material enjoyment, yet he was not at all affected by material lust. This position is called mukti, or liberation. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that within the Ganges flow great currents of water, capable of extinguishing a blazing fire. If an elephant maddened by sex desire stands within the Ganges, its powerful, cooling currents extinguish his lust, and the elephant becomes pacified. Similarly, ordinary human beings trapped in the cycle of birth and death are constantly harassed by the enemies of lust and greed, which never allow the mind to be completely peaceful. But if, following the example of the elephant, one situates oneself within the cooling waves of transcendental bliss, then all material desire will soon be extinguished, and one will become \u015b\u0101nta, or peaceful. As described in \u015ar\u012b Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-bhakta ni\u1e63k\u0101ma ataeva \u015b\u0101nta. Thus, everyone should take to the movement of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and cleanse himself in the cooling waters of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, our real, eternal consciousness."

        "purport": " Great mountains bear unlimited quantities of earth, which in turn give sustenance to innumerable forms of life such as trees, grass, birds, animals, and so on. Mountains also pour forth unlimited quantities of crystalline water in the form of waterfalls and rivers, and this water gives life to all. By studying the example of mountains, one should learn the art of providing for the happiness of all living entities. Similarly, one may take excellent lessons from the pious trees, who offer innumerable benefits, such as fruits, flowers, cooling shade and medicinal extracts. Even when a tree is suddenly cut down and dragged away, the tree does not protest but continues to give service to others in the form of firewood. Thus, one should become the disciple of such magnanimous trees and learn from them the qualities of saintly conduct. According to \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, the word par\u0101rthaik\u0101nta-sambhava\u1e25 indicates that one should dedicate all of one\u2019s wealth and other assets to the welfare of others. By one\u2019s acquired opulence, one should especially try to please the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, the demigods, as well as all truly respectable superior personalities, will automatically be pleased. By developing saintly conduct, as described in this verse, one will become tolerant, and this will free one from the useless agitation of the material senses, which drive one to wander throughout the world searching in vain for material happiness. Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has also emphasized the tree\u2019s quality of tolerance: taror iva sahi\u1e63\u1e47un\u0101, k\u012brtan\u012bya\u1e25 sad\u0101 hari\u1e25. One who is as tolerant as a tree can chant the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constantly, finding ever-new satisfaction."

One must properly maintain one\u2019s body by regulated activities of eating, sleeping, cleansing, etc., otherwise the mind will become weak, and one\u2019s spiritual knowledge will fade away. If one eats too austerely, or if in the name of selflessness one accepts impure food, surely one loses control of the mind. On the other hand, if one eats food that is excessively fatty or rich there will be an unwanted increase in sleep and semen, and thus the mind and speech will be overwhelmed by the modes of passion and ignorance.

One should moderately and intelligently regulate all of one\u2019s bodily activities so that they are favorable for self-realization. This technique is taught by the bona fide spiritual master. If one is too austere or if one engages too much in sense gratification, self-realization is impossible. It is the duty of a devotee of the Lord to avoid seeing any object as separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because that is illusion. A gentleman will never try to enjoy the property of another gentleman. Similarly, if one sees everything in relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is no scope for material sense gratification. But if one sees material objects as separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then one\u2019s material enjoying propensity is immediately aroused. A human being must be intelligent enough to distinguish between preyas, or temporary gratification, and \u015breyas, permanent benefit. One may accept sense activity in a regulated, limited fashion so that one will be strong for serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but if one excessively indulges the material senses, one will lose one\u2019s gravity and seriousness in spiritual life and act like an ordinary materialist. The ultimate goal, as stated here, is j\u00f1\u0101nam, or steady consciousness of the Absolute Truth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "translation": "Even a transcendentalist is surrounded by innumerable material objects, which possess good and bad qualities. However, one who has transcended material good and evil should not become entangled even when in contact with the material objects; rather, he should act like the wind.",
        "purport": " The wind is the external manifestation of air, whereas pr\u0101\u1e47a is the internal manifestation. When the wind passes over waterfalls it carries sprinkles of clear water and thus becomes most refreshing. Sometimes the wind blows through a beautiful forest, carrying the fragrances of fruits and flowers; at other times the wind may fuel a fire that burns the same forest to ashes. The wind, however, being fixed in its own nature, remains neutral in both its auspicious and inauspicious activities. Similarly, within this material world we will inevitably face both pleasing and disgusting situations. If, however, we remain fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we will not be disturbed by the inauspicious, nor will we become attached to the materially auspicious. In the course of his spiritual duties, a devotee sometimes finds himself chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a beautiful country atmosphere, and sometimes he finds himself doing the same thing in a hellish city. In both cases the devotee fixes his mind upon Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and experiences transcendental bliss. Although the wind passes through the most dark and forbidding places, the wind is not frightened or disturbed. Similarly, a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should never be fearful or anxious, even when in the most difficult situation. One who is attached to materially pleasing forms, tastes, smells, sounds and touches will also be repelled by the opposite in each category. Thus finding himself surrounded by innumerable good and bad things, the materialist is constantly disturbed. When the wind blows in many directions at once, the atmosphere becomes agitated. Similarly, if the mind is constantly attracted and repelled by material objects there will be such mental disturbance that it will be impossible to think of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, one should learn from the blowing wind the art of moving throughout the material world without attachment."

Similarly, one should see that the spirit soul enters within all forms of life, both moving and nonmoving, and that the individual souls are thus all-pervading. The sage should further observe that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the Supersoul, is simultaneously present within all things. Both the individual soul and the Supersoul can be understood by comparing them to the nature of the sky: although the sky extends everywhere and everything rests within the sky, the sky does not mix with anything, nor can it be divided by anything.",
        "purport": " Although air exists within the sky, the sky, or space, is different from air. Even in the absence of air, space or sky is present. All material objects are situated within space, or within the vast material sky, but the sky remains undivided and, although accommodating all objects, never actually mixes with anything. In the same way one can understand the situation of both the individual soul and the Supersoul. The individual soul is all-pervading, because there are innumerable j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101s, which enter within all things; yet, as confirmed in Vedic literature, each individual \u0101tm\u0101 remains infinitesimal. The \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (5.9) states: \u201cWhen the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.\u201d The same is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: \u201cThere are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is all-pervading because He Himself is personally present everywhere. The Lord is known as advaita, or indivisible. Thus the same unique Personality of Godhead exists everywhere, just like the sky, and yet is not attached to anything, although everything is resting within Him. The Lord Himself has confirmed this analysis of His all-pervasiveness in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.6): \u201cAs the almighty wind, blowing everywhere, always rests in ethereal space, know that in the same manner all beings rest in Me.\u201d Therefore, although both the j\u012bva soul and the Supersoul are said to be all-pervading, it should be remembered that there are innumerable individual j\u012bva souls, whereas there is only one Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is always supreme, and one who is actually a thoughtful sage never doubts the supreme position of the Lord."

Similarly, although the material body and mind undergo innumerable changes, such as birth and death, happiness and distress, love and hate, the eternal living entity is merely the background for such activities. The spirit soul, being most subtle, is not actually affected; only due to misidentification with the superficial activities of the body and mind does the soul undergo terrible distress within the material world. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has pointed out that the individual living entity must struggle to revive his divine spiritual qualities. The living entity is part and parcel of the supreme entity, called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and as such the individual soul is also a reservoir of godly qualities. The Personality of Godhead, however, automatically manifests these qualities without any hindrance, whereas the conditioned soul must struggle to revive such qualities. Thus, although both the Personality of Godhead and the personality of the living entity are eternal and transcendental, the Personality of Godhead is always supreme.

Just by seeing, touching or hearing such a saintly person, the living entity is purified, just as one is cleansed by contact with pure water. Thus a saintly person, just like a holy place, purifies all those who contact him because he always chants the glories of the Lord.",
        "purport": " The words ap\u0101\u1e41 mitram, \u201cjust like water,\u201d can also be read as agh\u0101n mitram, which means that a saintly person purifies all living entities by accepting them as mitram, or his personal friends, and saves them from their sinful reactions (agh\u0101t). The conditioned living entity falsely identifies with his gross material body and subtle mind and thus falls from the platform of spiritual knowledge. A conditioned living being is always lusty for material sense gratification, and if he does not acquire it, he becomes angry. Sometimes he is so obsessed with fear of losing his material gratification that he enters a stage approaching madness. A saintly person, however, is like pure water, free from all contamination and capable of purifying all things. Just as pure water is transparent, a saintly person transparently manifests the Personality of Godhead within his heart. Such love of Godhead is the reservoir of all happiness. Water makes a most pleasing vibration as it flows and cascades, and similarly the sound vibration of the Lord\u2019s pure devotee, who is saturated with the glories of the Lord, is most charming and beautiful. Thus, by studying the nature of water one can understand the symptoms of a pure devotee of the Lord."

        "translation": "Even when reflected in various objects, the sun is never divided, nor does it merge into its reflection. Only those with dull brains would consider the sun in this way. Similarly, although the soul is reflected through different material bodies, the soul remains undivided and nonmaterial.",
        "purport": " The sun is reflected in many objects, such as windows, mirrors, shiny metal, oil, water, and so on, yet the sun remains one and indivisible. Similarly, the eternal spirit soul within the body is reflected through the screen of the material body. Thus the soul appears to be old or young, fat or skinny, happy or sad. The soul may appear to be American, Russian, African, Hindu or Christian; however, the eternal soul in its natural position is free of any material designation. The word sth\u016bla-matibhi\u1e25 in this verse indicates those whose intelligence is gross and dull. We have practical experience of a dog urinating on a valuable painting at an outdoor art show. Due to its dull intelligence, the dog could not appreciate the actual value of the painting. Similarly, unless one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one is grossly misusing the invaluable opportunity of human life. Human life is meant for self-realization, and we should not waste time bickering over material designations such as capitalist, communist, American, Russian, and so on. Instead, all people should take to the loving devotional service of God and realize their eternal, pure identity. One should understand the sun by observing its direct manifestation and not its distorted reflection on material objects. Similarly, one should consider every living being in terms of his pure spiritual identity beyond the distorted manifestation of material designations. The word \u0101tm\u0101 in this verse also refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as we tend to observe ordinary j\u012bva souls through the reflection of the material body, we tend to observe the Personality of Godhead through the distorting screen of our material mind. Thus, we imagine God to be impersonal or material or unknowable. When the sky is overcast, sunlight is the highest possible perception of the sun, which is covered by clouds. Similarly, when one\u2019s mind is fogged over with mental speculation one may take the light emanating from the transcendental body of God to be the highest spiritual truth. However, when the mind is spotlessly clear like a cloudless blue sky, one can see the actual form of the Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Absolute Truth cannot be perfectly understood by the covered mind of the conditioned soul; rather, one must see the Lord through the clear blue sky of pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is free from fruitive desires and mental speculation. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura sings: \u201cThe holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends into the darkness of the material world just to benedict the conditioned souls. The holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just like the sun that rises in the clear sky of the heart of the devotees.\u201d Such brilliant knowledge cannot be understood by those who are trying, in the name of either piety or atheism, to exploit the material creation of the Lord. One must become a pure devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and then his knowledge will illuminate everything in all directions: kasmin nu bhagavo vij\u00f1\u0101te sarvam ida\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 bhavat\u012bti (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.3)."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29), suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m: the Lord is the eternal well-wisher of every living being. The Lord is so affectionate that He sits in the heart of every conditioned soul and accompanies him throughout his endless wandering in the kingdom of m\u0101y\u0101, patiently waiting for the conditioned soul to come back home, back to Godhead. Thus the Lord makes all arrangements for the eternal happiness of every living entity. The best way for anyone to show compassion and affection for all living beings is to become a preacher on behalf of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and assist the Lord in reclaiming the fallen souls. If our affection or attachment for others is based on bodily sense gratification, in the name of society, friendship and love, that excessive, unwanted affection (ati-sneha) will cause burning pain at the time of the breaking or destruction of the relationship. Now the story of the foolish pigeon will be narrated.

Thus appealing to his noble sentiments, she efficiently engaged him as her faithful servant. The poor pigeon was ajitendriya, or one who cannot control his senses and whose heart is easily melted by the beauty of a woman. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a avadh\u016bta is giving valuable instructions by narrating this story of the two pigeons and the terrible distress they suffered by inevitable separation. If one\u2019s intelligence is not dedicated to serving H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the Supreme Lord of sense activity, undoubtedly one will plunge into the nescience of bodily gratification.
