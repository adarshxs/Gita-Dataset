        "translation": "My dear King, you should understand that the Supreme Lord\u2019s appearance and disappearance, which resemble those of embodied conditioned souls, are actually a show enacted by His illusory energy, just like the performance of an actor. After creating this universe He enters into it, plays within it for some time, and at last winds it up. Then the Lord remains situated in His own transcendental glory, having ceased from the functions of cosmic manifestation.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the so-called fight among the members of the Yadu dynasty was actually a display of the pastime potency of the Lord, since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal associates are never subject to ordinary birth and death like conditioned souls. This being the case, certainly the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself is transcendental to material birth and death, as clearly stated in this verse. The word na\u1e6dasya, \u201cof an actor or magician,\u201d is significant here. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura tells the following story of a certain magician who exhibits the trick of dying: \u201cIn front of a great king, a magician approaches a stack of valuable garments, jewels, coins and so forth, all placed there by the king. Taking a jeweled necklace, the magician tells the king, \u2018Now I am taking this necklace, and you can\u2019t have it,\u2019 and he makes the necklace disappear. \u2018Now I\u2019m taking this gold coin, and you can\u2019t have it,\u2019 he says, and makes the gold coin disappear. Next, challenging the king in the same way, the magician makes seven thousand horses disappear. Then the magician creates the illusion that the king\u2019s children, grandchildren, brothers and other family members have attacked each other and that nearly all are dead from the violent quarrel. The king hears the magician speaking and at the same time observes these things taking place before him as he sits in the great assembly hall. \u201cThen the magician says, \u2018O King, I no longer wish to live. Just as I have studied magic, so also, by the mercy of the lotus feet of my guru, I have learned the mystic meditation of yoga. One is supposed to give up one\u2019s body while meditating in a holy place, and since you have performed so many pious activities, you are a holy place yourself. Therefore I shall now give up my body.\u2019 \u201cThus speaking, the magician sits down in the proper yoga posture, fixes himself in pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na and sam\u0101dhi, and becomes silent. A moment later, a fire generated from his trance blazes forth out of his body and burns it to ashes. Then all the wives of the magician, distraught with lamentation, enter into that fire. \u201cThree or four days later, after the magician has returned to his own province, he sends one of his daughters to the king. The daughter tells him, \u2018O King, I have just come to your palace, bringing along with me, invisibly, all your sons, grandsons and brothers in good health \u2014 along with all the jewels and other items given by you. Please, therefore, give me whatever you consider fitting remuneration for the wisdom of the magic that has been exhibited before you.\u2019 In this way, even by ordinary magic one can simulate birth and death.\u201d It is not difficult to understand, therefore, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although transcendental to the laws of nature, exhibits His illusory potency so that ordinary fools will think the Lord has left His body like a human being. Actually, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a returned to His abode in His own eternal body, as confirmed throughout the Vedic literature."

        "translation": "Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a brought the son of His guru back from the planet of the lord of death in the boy\u2019s selfsame body, and as the ultimate giver of protection He saved you also when you were burned by the brahm\u0101stra of A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101. He conquered in battle even Lord \u015aiva, who deals death to the agents of death, and He sent the hunter Jar\u0101 directly to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha in his human body. How could such a personality be unable to protect His own Self?",
        "purport": " To mitigate his own and Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s distress at the narration of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s departure from this world, \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b here gives several clear examples proving that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is far beyond the influence of death. Although the son of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s spiritual master (S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni) had been taken by death, the Lord brought him back in his same body. Similarly, the power of Brahman cannot touch Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, since Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, though burned by the brahm\u0101stra weapon, was easily saved by the Lord. Lord \u015aiva was clearly defeated by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the battle with B\u0101\u1e47\u0101sura, and the hunter Jar\u0101 was sent to a Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet in his same human body. Death is an insignificant expansion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s external potency and cannot possibly act upon the Lord Himself. Those who actually understand the transcendental nature of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities will find convincing evidence in these examples."
