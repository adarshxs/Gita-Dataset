It is only in human life that one deeply considers one\u2019s ultimate benefit in life. Human birth is therefore more desirable than even that of the demigods.\u201d Within human life the position of a high-class br\u0101hma\u1e47a is certainly most desirable. If a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, however, gives up the devotional service of the Lord and works hard like a \u015b\u016bdra simply for the prestige of his community, he is certainly on the platform of material sense gratification. The special qualification of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as is the spiritual knowledge by which they recognize every living entity to be an eternal servant of the Lord. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a, free from false ego, thus feels himself lower than a blade of grass and tolerantly offers respect to all living entities. All human beings, and especially the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, should avoid becoming killers of their own self-interest by neglecting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the loving service of the Lord. Such neglect paves the way for future suffering."

The word bal\u012byas in this verse, meaning \u201cvery strong,\u201d indicates that the material mind becomes insensitive to intelligent advice. Even if we are informed that we are committing many sins and offenses in order to earn money, we may still think that money should be acquired at all costs, since without it one can neither perform religious ceremonies nor gratify the senses with beautiful women, mansions and vehicles. Once the money is achieved, one suffers further problems, but the stubborn mind will never heed good advice in this regard. One must therefore give up mental concoction and control the mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as exemplified here by the br\u0101hma\u1e47a from Avant\u012b."

Foolish conditioned souls endeavor to eliminate distress and enjoy happiness, but material happiness and distress are two sides of the same coin. One cannot relish bodily happiness without identifying oneself as the body. But as soon as such identification occurs, one is harassed by the innumerable pains and sufferings also inevitably present within the same body. Bodily happiness and distress are administered by the demigods, who can never be brought under our control; thus one remains subject to the whims of providence on the material platform. If, however, one surrenders to the Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the reservoir of all pleasure, one can reach the spiritual platform, where transcendental bliss enlivens the liberated souls without any interrupting anxiety or unhappiness."

According to this theory, nothing except the soul actually exists, and if we were to perceive something besides the soul, that would be illusion. Therefore, since happiness and distress do not actually exist in this concept, why become angry at oneself or others?",
        "purport": " Because a dead body does not feel pleasure or pain, our happiness and distress are due to our own consciousness, which is the nature of the soul. It is not, however, the original function of the soul to enjoy material happiness and suffer material distress. These are produced by ignorant material affection and enmity based on false ego. Our involvement in sense gratification drags our consciousness into the material body, where it is shocked by the inevitable bodily pains and problems. On the spiritual platform there is neither material happiness nor distress because there the living consciousness is fully engaged, without personal desire, in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. This is the actual position of happiness, aloof from false bodily identification. Rather than uselessly becoming enraged with others for one\u2019s own foolishness, one should take to self-realization and solve the problems of life."

The idea of material work arises when there is a spiritual actor who is conscious and a material body that undergoes the transformation of happiness and distress as a reaction to such work. Since the body has no life, it cannot be the actual recipient of happiness and distress, nor can the soul, who is ultimately completely spiritual and aloof from the material body. Since karma thus has no ultimate basis in either the body or the soul, at whom can one become angry?",
        "purport": " The material body is composed of earth, water, fire and air, just like bricks, stones and other objects. Our consciousness, falsely absorbed in the body, experiences happiness and distress, and fruitive work (karma) is performed when we falsely consider ourselves to be the enjoyers of the material world. False ego is thus the illusory combination within our minds of the self and the body, which are actually two separate objects. Since karma, or material work, is based on illusory consciousness, these activities are also illusory and have no factual basis in either the body or the soul. When a conditioned soul falsely considers himself to be the body, and consequently the enjoyer of the material world, he tries to find pleasure in illicit connection with women. Such sinful activity is based on his false concept of being the body and thus the enjoyer of women and of the world. Since he is not the body, his activity of enjoying a woman does not actually exist. There is merely the interaction of two machines, namely the two bodies, and the interaction of the illusory consciousness of the man and woman. The sensation of illicit sex occurs within the material body and is falsely assimilated by the false ego as its own experience. Thus the miserable or pleasurable reactions of karma ultimately act upon the false ego and not upon the body, which is composed of dull matter, nor upon the soul, which has nothing to do with matter. False ego is the illusory concoction of the mind; it is specifically this false ego that is suffering happiness and distress. The soul cannot become angry at others, since he is not personally enjoying or suffering. Rather, the false ego is doing this."

        "purport": " This verse is quoted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja in his Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya-l\u012bl\u0101 3.6). \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da comments as follows. \u201cIn connection with this verse, which is a quotation from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.23.57), \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that of the sixty-four items required for rendering devotional service, acceptance of the symbolic marks of sanny\u0101sa is a regulative principle. If one accepts the sanny\u0101sa order, his main business is to devote his life completely to the service of Mukunda, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one does not completely devote his mind and body to the service of the Lord, he does not actually become a sanny\u0101s\u012b. It is not simply a matter of changing dress. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.1) it is also stated, an\u0101\u015brita\u1e25 karma-phala\u1e41 k\u0101rya\u1e41 karma karoti ya\u1e25/ sa sanny\u0101s\u012b ca yog\u012b ca: one who works devotedly for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a sanny\u0101s\u012b. The dress is not sanny\u0101sa, but the attitude of service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. \u201cThe word par\u0101tma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 means being a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Par\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Person, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25. Those who are completely dedicated to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in service are actually sanny\u0101s\u012bs. As a matter of formality, the devotee accepts the sanny\u0101sa dress as previous \u0101c\u0101ryas did. He also accepts the three da\u1e47\u1e0das. Later Vi\u1e63\u1e47usv\u0101m\u012b considered that accepting the dress of a trida\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b was par\u0101tma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101. Therefore sincere devotees add another da\u1e47\u1e0da, the j\u012bva-da\u1e47\u1e0da, to the three existing da\u1e47\u1e0das. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012b is known as a trida\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012b. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012b accepts only one da\u1e47\u1e0da, not understanding the purpose of trida\u1e47\u1e0da. Later, many persons in the community of \u015aiva Sv\u0101m\u012b gave up the \u0101tma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 (devotional service) of the Lord and followed the path of \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya. Instead of accepting 108 names, those in the \u015aiva Sv\u0101m\u012b samprad\u0101ya follow the path of \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya and accept the ten names of sanny\u0101sa. Although \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu accepted the then-existing order of sanny\u0101sa (namely ekada\u1e47\u1e0da), He still recited a verse from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam about the trida\u1e47\u1e0da-sanny\u0101sa accepted by the br\u0101hma\u1e47a of Avant\u012bpura. Indirectly He declared that within that ekada\u1e47\u1e0da (one da\u1e47\u1e0da), four da\u1e47\u1e0das existed as one. Accepting ekada\u1e47\u1e0da sanny\u0101sa without par\u0101tma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 (devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) is not acceptable to \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. In addition, according to the exact regulative principles, one should add the j\u012bva-da\u1e47\u1e0da to the trida\u1e47\u1e0da. These four da\u1e47\u1e0das, bound together as one, are symbolic of unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. Because the ekada\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012bs of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da school are not devoted to the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they try to merge into the Brahman effulgence, which is a marginal position between material and spiritual existence. They accept this impersonal position as liberation. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, not knowing that \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was a trida\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b, think of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu as an ekada\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012b. This is due to their vivarta, bewilderment. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam there is no such thing as an ekada\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012b; indeed, the trida\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012b is accepted as the symbolic representation of the sanny\u0101sa order. By citing this verse from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu accepted the sanny\u0101sa order recommended in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, who are enamored of the external energy of the Lord, cannot understand the mind of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. \u201cTo date, all the devotees of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, following in His footsteps, accept the sanny\u0101sa order and keep the sacred thread and tuft of unshaved hair. The ekada\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012bs of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b school give up the sacred thread and do not keep any tuft of hair. Therefore they are unable to understand the purport of trida\u1e47\u1e0da-sanny\u0101sa, and as such they are not inclined to dedicate their lives to the service of Mukunda. They simply think of merging into the existence of Brahman because of their disgust with the material existence. The \u0101c\u0101ryas who advocate the daiva-var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama (the social order of c\u0101tur-var\u1e47yam mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101) do not accept the proposition of \u0101sura-var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama, which maintains that the social order of var\u1e47a is indicated by birth. \u201cThe most intimate devotee of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, namely Gad\u0101dhara Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, accepted the trida\u1e47\u1e0da-sanny\u0101sa and also accepted M\u0101dhava Up\u0101dhy\u0101ya as his trida\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012b disciple. It is said that from this M\u0101dhv\u0101c\u0101rya the samprad\u0101ya known in western India as the Vallabh\u0101c\u0101rya samprad\u0101ya has begun. \u015ar\u012bla Gop\u0101la Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Vasu, who is known as a sm\u1e5bty-\u0101c\u0101rya in the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava samprad\u0101ya, later accepted the trida\u1e47\u1e0da-sanny\u0101sa order from Trida\u1e47\u1e0dip\u0101da Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b. Although acceptance of trida\u1e47\u1e0da-sanny\u0101sa is not distinctly mentioned in the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava literature, the first verse of \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s Upade\u015b\u0101m\u1e5bta advocates that one should accept the trida\u1e47\u1e0da-sanny\u0101sa order by controlling the six forces: \u2018One who can control the forces of speech, mind, anger, belly, tongue and genitals is known as a gosv\u0101m\u012b and is competent to accept disciples all over the world.\u2019 The followers of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu never accepted the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da order of sanny\u0101sa, and for this they cannot be blamed. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu accepted \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, who was a trida\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012b, but the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, not understanding \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, sometimes think that \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b belonged to the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da ekada\u1e47\u1e0da-sanny\u0101sa community. Actually this was not the case.\u201d"

        "translation": "Anyone who listens to or recites to others this song of the sanny\u0101s\u012b, which presents scientific knowledge of the Absolute, and who thus meditates upon it with full attention, will never again be overwhelmed by the dualities of material happiness and distress.",
        "purport": " The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012b took shelter of the devotional service of the Lord and thus could overcome the illusory potency of his worshipable object, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He himself meditated upon and heard this song, and also taught it to others. Having received the Lord\u2019s mercy, he enlightened other conditioned souls with transcendental intelligence so that they could also follow in the footsteps of the devotees of the Lord. Religion actually means to become a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord in loving service. Those who are trying to enjoy the material world or merely renounce it to avoid personal inconvenience cannot actually understand love of Godhead, in which the only objective is the satisfaction of the Lord."
