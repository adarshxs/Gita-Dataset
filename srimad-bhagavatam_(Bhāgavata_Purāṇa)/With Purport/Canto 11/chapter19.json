        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: A self-realized person who has cultivated scriptural knowledge up to the point of enlightenment and who is free from impersonal speculation, understanding the material universe to be simply illusion, should surrender unto Me both that knowledge and the means by which he achieved it.",
        "purport": " M\u0101y\u0101-m\u0101tram ida\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 indicates knowledge that the eternal spirit soul and the eternal Personality of Godhead are completely separate from the temporary qualities of the material world. The word vidy\u0101-\u015bruta-sampanna means that one should cultivate Vedic knowledge for the purpose of enlightenment and not to make a show of mysticism, intellectuality or impersonal speculation. Having neutralized the illusory effects of m\u0101y\u0101, one should then transfer one\u2019s attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, surrendering the process of philosophical negation to the Lord Himself. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b gives the example that when there is danger the king may issue weapons to private citizens, but after military victory the individual citizens return the weapons to the king. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains this point of this verse as follows. Somehow or other the living entity has to free himself from material illusion, which has covered him since time immemorial. Cultivating desirelessness and renunciation by practice of the mystic yoga system, the living entity develops knowledge of illusion and may thus lift himself above the reach of material ignorance. However, once one is situated on the transcendental platform, both knowledge of illusion and the process of acquiring such knowledge have no further practical application. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura gives the example that a man may be haunted by the ghost of a snake or a tiger. As long as the man is possessed and thinks, \u201cI am a snake\u201d or \u201cI am a tiger,\u201d attempts will be made to counteract the ghostly influence by application of jewels, mantras and herbs. But when the man is freed from possession by ghosts, he again thinks, \u201cI am Mr. So-and-so, the son of Mr. So-and-so,\u201d and returns to his original nature. At that time the jewels, mantras and herbs have no further immediate application. The word vidy\u0101 in this verse thus indicates knowledge acquired through philosophical analysis, mystic yoga, austerities and renunciation. Such knowledge of the temporary, illusory nature of this world counteracts ignorance, and there are many Vedic scriptures that train the living entity in such knowledge. Gradually one gives up his false identification with the material body and mind and with those material objects that interact with the body and mind. Having realized such counteractive knowledge, one must engage in the loving service of the Personality of Godhead and become a pure devotee. When one is completely perfect in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is naturally little interest in the innumerable details of illusion, and gradually one is transferred to the spiritual world."

        "translation": "For learned, self-realized philosophers I am the only object of worship, the desired goal of life, the means for achieving that goal, and the settled conclusion of all knowledge. Indeed, because I am the cause of their happiness and their freedom from unhappiness, such learned souls have no effective purpose or dear object in life except Me.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stated that one should ultimately surrender unto Him that knowledge by which the material world is seen as illusion. Material attachments are certainly problems for the living entities, since they are diseases of the spirit soul. One who has contracted a skin disease that causes terrible itching gains only flickering relief by scratching the unbearable sores. If he does not scratch he suffers greatly, but by scratching, even though there is an instantaneous sensation of pleasure, unbearable misery follows as the itching increases. Real happiness is not found in scratching one\u2019s skin infections but rather in becoming free from such disease. Conditioned souls are harassed by many illusory desires, and in desperation they try to gratify their senses through the hopeless scratching processes of illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. They further try to gain relief through material society, friendship and love, but the result is unbearable suffering. Real happiness is to eliminate completely the itching disease of material desire. Since material desire is a disease of the soul, one must acquire knowledge to treat this disease and eliminate it. Such therapeutic knowledge is essential as long as one is diseased, but when one is fully healthy, such technical medical knowledge is no longer interesting to the healthy person, and he may leave such knowledge to the doctors. Similarly, in the advanced stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one need not think continually of one\u2019s personal problems but may rather think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, with love and devotion. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises in the previous verse that one should eliminate one\u2019s personal problems through technical knowledge of illusion. After giving up constant meditation on such problems, one can then become a lover of God. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a certainly guides each and every sincere devotee internally within the heart and externally through the bona fide spiritual master. In this way, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gradually trains His sincere devotees to give up their irrational attachment to dead matter. Once freedom has been achieved, a devotee begins to seriously cultivate his relationship with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the spiritual sky. One may falsely think that just as at a certain stage of advancement one ceases to concentrate on technical, analytic knowledge of illusion, so, at another stage one may give up loving devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To nullify such speculation Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here states in various ways that He is the supreme eternal goal of all truly learned human beings. Indeed, the most prominent scholars within the universe are the sages, such as the four Kum\u0101ras, who accept Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as their only worshipable object. Because they have discovered that they are eternal fragmental portions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they are not interested in fruitive activities and mental speculation. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a awards celestial bliss and freedom from anxiety to His sincere followers, who have no purpose or beloved object in life other than the Lord."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here refers to such great transcendental scholars as the four Kum\u0101ras, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura and \u015ar\u012bla A.C.

The Lord similarly states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.17-18): \u201cOf these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me through pure devotional service is the best. For I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me.\u201d \u201cAll these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me. Being engaged in My transcendental service, he attains Me.\u201d J\u00f1\u0101na refers to an authorized philosophical and analytic perception of reality, and when such knowledge is clearly realized through the sanctification of consciousness the resultant comprehensive experience is called vij\u00f1\u0101na. Speculative, impersonal knowledge does not actually purify the heart of the living entity but rather merges him ever deeper into forgetfulness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as a father is always proud of his son\u2019s education, similarly, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes very happy to see the living entities acquiring a sound spiritual education and thus making progress on the way back home, back to Godhead."

How is it possible, therefore, that the various stages of the body, namely birth, growth, reproduction, maintenance, dwindling and death, can have any relation to your eternal self? These phases relate only to the material body, which previously did not exist and ultimately will not exist. The body exists merely at the present moment.",
        "purport": " The example is given that a man walking in the forest may see a rope but consider it to be a snake. Such perception is m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, although the rope actually exists and a snake also exists in another place. Illusion thus refers to the false identification of one object with another. The material body exists briefly and then disappears. In the past the body did not exist, and in the future it will not exist; it enjoys a flickering, momentary existence in so-called present time. If we falsely identify ourselves as the material body or mind, we are creating an illusion. One who identifies himself as American, Russian, Chinese, Mexican, black or white, man or woman, communist or capitalist, and so on, accepting such designations as his permanent identity, is certainly in deep illusion. He can be compared to a sleeping man who sees himself acting in a different body while dreaming. In the previous verse Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told Uddhava that spiritual knowledge is the means of achieving the highest perfection, and now the Lord is explicitly describing such knowledge."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, recognizing Uddhava\u2019s highly intellectual nature, has repeatedly recommended to him that one should achieve perfection by cultivation of transcendental knowledge. But the Lord has also clearly demonstrated that such knowledge must bring one to the point of loving devotional service to Him, for otherwise it is useless. In this verse \u015ar\u012b Uddhava corroborates Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statements that actual happiness is obtained by surrendering to His lotus feet. When the incarnation of Godhead P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was crowned, the demigod V\u0101yu presented him with an umbrella that constantly sprayed fine particles of water. The Lord\u2019s two lotus feet are similarly compared here to a wonderful umbrella that produces a constant shower of delicious nectar, the bliss of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Normally, speculative analytic knowledge terminates in an impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth, but the so-called bliss of merging into impersonal spiritual existence can never be compared to the bliss of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as stated here by \u015ar\u012b Uddhava. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness thus automatically constitutes perfect knowledge, since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate shelter of all living entities. The words abhihatasya and abhivar\u1e63\u0101t are significant in this verse. Abhihatasya indicates one who is being defeated on all sides by the onslaught of material nature, whereas abhivar\u1e63\u0101t indicates a downpour of nectar that eliminates all of the problems of material existence. By our intelligence we should look beyond the dull material body and nonsensical material mind to observe the unlimited shower of blissful nectar coming from the two lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then our real good fortune will begin."

        "translation": "O almighty Lord, please be merciful and uplift this hopeless living entity who has fallen into the dark hole of material existence, where the snake of time has bitten him. In spite of such abominable conditions, this poor living entity has tremendous desire to relish the most insignificant material happiness. Please save me, my Lord, by pouring down the nectar of Your instructions, which awaken one to spiritual freedom.",
        "purport": " Material life, so much cherished by the nondevotees, is here compared to a dark hole filled with poisonous snakes. In material life there is certainly no clear understanding of one\u2019s ultimate identity, of God or of the universe. Everything is vague and dark. In material life the poisonous snake of time is always threatening, and at any moment our near and dear ones will be killed by the mortal fangs of the serpent. Ultimately, we ourselves will also be bitten and killed by the poisonous effects of time. The word sampatitam indicates that the falldown of the living entity is complete. In other words, he cannot get up again. \u015ar\u012b Uddhava therefore appeals to the Lord to be kind to these poor fallen souls, humbly represented by his own self. If one receives the Lord\u2019s mercy, then even without any further qualification one can go back home, back to Godhead; and without the mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the most learned, austere, powerful, wealthy or beautiful man will be pathetically crushed by the material world\u2019s machinery of illusion. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, as described here, is mah\u0101nubh\u0101va, or the greatest, most powerful and most merciful personality, whose influence extends everywhere. The Lord\u2019s mercy is manifest in the form of His nectarean instructions such as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and the Uddhava-g\u012bt\u0101, being spoken here. The word k\u1e63udra-sukhoru-tar\u1e63am reveals the irony of material existence. Although material happiness is k\u1e63udra, or ridiculous and insignificant, our desire to enjoy it is uru, tremendous. Our disproportionate hankering to enjoy dead matter is certainly an illusory state of mind, and it gives us constant distress, keeping us bound up in the dark hole of material existence. Every living entity should put aside his false prestige based on ephemeral bodily qualifications and appeal sincerely to the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for His mercy. The Lord hears every sincere appeal, from even the most fallen soul, and the effects of the Lord\u2019s mercy are wonderful. Although j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, yog\u012bs and fruitive workers are laboriously endeavoring to achieve their respective goals, their position is precarious and uncertain. Simply by achieving the mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, one can very easily attain the highest perfection of life. If even one who is not a great or pure devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sincerely appeals to the Lord for His mercy, the Lord is sure to give it generously."

        "purport": " The difference between j\u00f1\u0101na (ordinary Vedic knowledge) and vij\u00f1\u0101na (self-realization) can be understood as follows. A conditioned soul, although cultivating Vedic knowledge, continues to identify himself to some extent with the material body and mind and consequently with the material universe. In trying to understand the world he lives in, the conditioned soul learns through Vedic knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the one supreme cause of all material manifestations. He comes to understand the world around him, which he accepts more or less as his world. As he progresses in spiritual realization, breaking through the barrier of bodily identification, and realizes the existence of the eternal soul, he gradually identifies himself as part and parcel of the spiritual world, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. At that time he is no longer interested in the Personality of Godhead merely as the supreme explanation of the material world; rather, he begins to reorient his entire mode of consciousness so that the central object of his attention is the Personality of Godhead. Such a reorientation is required, since the Supreme Lord is the factual center and cause of everything. A self-realized soul in the stage of vij\u00f1\u0101na thus experiences the Personality of Godhead not merely as the creator of the material world but as the supreme living entity existing blissfully in His own eternal context. As one progresses in one\u2019s realization of the Supreme Lord in His own abode in the spiritual sky, one gradually becomes disinterested in the material universe and ceases to define the Supreme Lord in terms of His temporary manifestations. A self-realized soul in the stage of vij\u00f1\u0101na is not at all attracted by objects that are created, maintained and ultimately destroyed. The stage of j\u00f1\u0101na is the preliminary stage of knowledge for those still identifying themselves in terms of the material universe, whereas vij\u00f1\u0101na is the mature stage of knowledge for those who see themselves as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord."

        "purport": " The Lord here reiterates that the one Supreme Personality of Godhead is the basis of unlimited material variety. Material activity is a chain of cause-and-effect relationships by which innumerable objects are produced. A particular material effect is converted into a subsequent cause, and when the causal phase is terminated, the effect disappears. Fire causes firewood to burn to ashes, and when the causal function of fire is finished, fire itself, which was the effect of a previous cause, is also terminated. The simple fact is that all material objects are created, maintained and ultimately annihilated by the supreme potency of the Lord. And when the entire field of material cause and effect is withdrawn, so that all cause-effect relationships vanish, the Personality of Godhead remains in His own abode. Therefore, although innumerable objects may function as causes, they are not the ultimate or supreme cause. Only the Personality of Godhead is the absolute cause. Similarly, although material things may exist, they do not always exist. The Personality of Godhead alone has absolute existence. By the process of j\u00f1\u0101na, or knowledge, one should understand the supreme position of the Lord."

        "purport": " In the \u015bruti, or Vedic literature, it is clearly stated that everything emanates from the Absolute Truth, is maintained by the Absolute Truth and at the end is conserved within the Absolute Truth. Similarly, by direct experience we can observe the creation and destruction of great empires, cities, buildings, bodies and so on. Furthermore, we find all around the world traditional wisdom warning people that things in this world cannot last. Finally, by logical induction we can easily conclude that nothing in this world is permanent. Material sense gratification \u2014 up to the highest possible living standard found in the heavenly planets or down to the lowest conditions in the most repugnant precincts of hell \u2014 is always unsteady and prone to collapse at any moment. One should therefore develop vair\u0101gya, detachment, as stated here. Another meaning of this verse is that the four types of evidence cited here are often mutually contradictory in their description of the highest truth. One should therefore be detached from the duality of mundane evidence, including the portions of the Vedas that deal with the material world. Instead, one should accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the actual authority. Both in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and here in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is personally speaking, and thus there is no need to enter into the bewildering network of competing systems of mundane logic. One can directly hear from the Absolute Truth Himself and immediately acquire perfect knowledge. One thereby becomes detached from inferior systems of knowledge, which cause one to hover on the material mental platform."

What other purpose or goal could remain for My devotee?",
        "purport": " The words mad-bhakta-p\u016bj\u0101bhyadhik\u0101 are significant in this verse. Abhyadhik\u0101 indicates \u201csuperior quality.\u201d The Lord is extremely satisfied with those who offer worship to His pure devotees, and He rewards them accordingly. Because of the Lord\u2019s generous appraisal of His pure devotees, worship of the pure devotees is described as superior to worship of the Lord Himself. The words mad-arthe\u1e63v a\u1e45ga-ce\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 state that ordinary, bodily activities such as brushing the teeth, taking bath, eating, etc., should all be offered to the Supreme Lord as devotional service. The words vacas\u0101 mad-gu\u1e47era\u1e47am indicate that whether one speaks in ordinary, crude language or with learned poetic eloquence, one should describe the glories of the Personality of Godhead. The words mad-arthe\u00a0\u2019rtha-parity\u0101ga\u1e25 indicate that one should spend one\u2019s money for festivals glorifying the Personality of Godhead, such as Ratha-y\u0101tr\u0101, Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b and Gaura-p\u016br\u1e47im\u0101. Also, one is herein instructed to spend money to assist the mission of one\u2019s spiritual master and other Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Wealth that cannot be used properly in the Lord\u2019s service and is thus an impediment to one\u2019s clear consciousness should be given up entirely. The word bhogasya refers to sense gratification, headed by sex enjoyment, and sukhasya refers to sentimental material happiness, such as excessive family attachment. The words datta\u1e41 hutam indicate that one should offer to br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas first-class foods cooked in ghee. One should offer the vibration sv\u0101h\u0101 to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in an authorized sacrificial fire along with grains and ghee. The word japtam indicates that one should constantly chant the holy names of the Lord."

One who is not a pure devotee of the Lord, however, but whose devotion is mixed with a fascination for mystic knowledge, is strengthened by the material mode of goodness. Through his meditation on the Lord he achieves the lesser results of dharma (piety in the mode of goodness), j\u00f1\u0101na (knowledge of spirit and matter) and vair\u0101gya (detachment from the lower modes of nature). Ultimately, one should be a pure devotee of the Lord, since even the best the material world has to offer is most insignificant compared to the kingdom of God."

Also, my Lord, tell me what is mental equilibrium, what is self-control, and what is the actual meaning of tolerance and steadfastness. What are charity, austerity and heroism, and how are reality and truth to be described? What is renunciation, and what is wealth? What is desirable, what is sacrifice, and what is religious remuneration? My dear Ke\u015bava, O most fortunate one, how am I to understand the strength, opulence and profit of a particular person? What is the best education, what is actual humility, and what is real beauty? What are happiness and unhappiness? Who is learned, and who is a fool? What are the true and the false paths in life, and what are heaven and hell? Who is indeed a true friend, and what is one\u2019s real home? Who is a rich man, and who is a poor man? Who is wretched, and who is an actual controller? O Lord of the devotees, kindly explain these matters to me, along with their opposites.",

        "translation": "Absorbing the intelligence in Me constitutes mental equilibrium, and complete discipline of the senses is self-control. Tolerance means patiently enduring unhappiness, and steadfastness occurs when one conquers the tongue and genitals. The greatest charity is to give up all aggression toward others, and renunciation of lust is understood to be real austerity. Real heroism is to conquer one\u2019s natural tendency to enjoy material life, and reality is seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead everywhere. Truthfulness means to speak the truth in a pleasing way, as declared by great sages. Cleanliness is detachment in fruitive activities, whereas renunciation is the sanny\u0101sa order of life. The true desirable wealth for human beings is religiousness, and I, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, am sacrifice. Religious remuneration is devotion to the \u0101c\u0101rya with the purpose of acquiring spiritual instruction, and the greatest strength is the pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma system of breath control.",
        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here describes those qualities that are desirable for persons advancing in human life. \u015aama, or \u201cmental equilibrium,\u201d means to fix the intelligence in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mere peacefulness without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a dull and useless state of mind. Dama, or \u201cdiscipline,\u201d means first to control one\u2019s own senses. If one wants to discipline one\u2019s children, disciples or followers without controlling one\u2019s own senses, one becomes a mere laughingstock. Tolerance means to patiently endure unhappiness, such as that provoked by the insults or negligence of others. One must also sometimes accept material inconvenience to carry out the injunctions of scriptures, and that unhappiness must also be patiently endured. If one is not tolerant of the insults and abuse of others, nor tolerant of the inconveniences that may arise from following authorized religious scriptures, it is simply foolishness for him to make a whimsical show of tolerating extreme heat, cold and pain and so on, just to impress others. Concerning steadfastness, if one does not control the tongue and genitals, then any other steadfastness is useless. Real charity means to renounce all aggression toward others. If one gives money to charitable causes but at the same time engages in exploitative business enterprises or abusive political tactics, one\u2019s charity is worth nothing at all. Austerity means to give up lust and sense gratification and to observe prescribed vows such as Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b; it does not mean inventing whimsical methods of torturing the material body. Real heroism is to conquer one\u2019s lower nature. Certainly everyone likes to propagate his own fame as a brilliant person, but everyone is also subject to lust, anger, greed and so forth. Therefore, if one can conquer these lower characteristics generated from the modes of passion and ignorance, one is a greater hero than those who merely destroy their political opponents through intrigue and violence. One can develop equal vision by giving up jealousy and envy and by recognizing the existence of the soul within every material body. This attitude pleases the Supreme Lord, who then reveals Himself, solidifying forever one\u2019s equal vision. Merely describing things that exist does not constitute the last word in the perception of reality. One must also see the true spiritual equality of all living entities and all situations. Truthfulness means that one should speak in a pleasing way so that there will be a beneficial effect. If one becomes attached to pointing out the faults of others in the name of truth, then such faultfinding will not be appreciated by saintly persons. The bona fide spiritual master speaks the truth in such a way that people can elevate themselves to the spiritual platform, and one should learn this art of truthfulness. If one is attached to material things, his body and mind are understood to be always polluted. Cleanliness therefore means to give up material attachment, not merely to frequently rinse one\u2019s skin with water. Real renunciation is giving up one\u2019s false sense of proprietorship over one\u2019s relatives and wife, and not just giving away material objects, while real wealth is to be religious. Sacrifice is the Personality of Godhead Himself, because the performer of sacrifice, to be successful, must absorb his consciousness in the Personality of Godhead and not in temporary, material rewards that may accrue from sacrifice. Real religious remuneration means that one should serve saintly persons who can enlighten one with spiritual knowledge. One may offer remuneration to his spiritual master, who has enlightened him, by distributing the same knowledge to others, thereby pleasing the \u0101c\u0101rya. Preaching work thus constitutes the highest form of remuneration. By performing the pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma system of respiratory control, one can easily subdue the mind, and one who can in this way perfectly control the restless mind is the most powerful person."

        "translation": "Actual opulence is My own nature as the Personality of Godhead, through which I exhibit the six unlimited opulences. The supreme gain in life is devotional service to Me, and actual education is nullifying the false perception of duality within the soul. Real modesty is to be disgusted with improper activities, and beauty is to possess good qualities such as detachment. Real happiness is to transcend material happiness and unhappiness, and real misery is to be implicated in searching for sex pleasure. A wise man is one who knows the process of freedom from bondage, and a fool is one who identifies with his material body and mind. The real path in life is that which leads to Me, and the wrong path is sense gratification, by which consciousness is bewildered. Actual heaven is the predominance of the mode of goodness, whereas hell is the predominance of ignorance. I am everyone\u2019s true friend, acting as the spiritual master of the entire universe, and one\u2019s home is the human body. My dear friend Uddhava, one who is enriched with good qualities is actually said to be rich, and one who is unsatisfied in life is actually poor. A wretched person is one who cannot control his senses, whereas one who is not attached to sense gratification is a real controller. One who attaches himself to sense gratification is the opposite, a slave. Thus, Uddhava, I have elucidated all of the matters about which you inquired. There is no need for a more elaborate description of these good and bad qualities, since to constantly see good and bad is itself a bad quality. The best quality is to transcend material good and evil.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is naturally full of six opulences, namely unlimited beauty, wealth, fame, knowledge, strength and renunciation. Therefore the greatest profit in life is to achieve personal loving service to the Lord, who is naturally the reservoir of all pleasure. Real education means to give up the false idea that anything is separate from the Lord, the source of all potencies. Similarly, one should not falsely consider the individual soul to be different or separate from the Supreme Soul. Mere bashfulness does not constitute modesty. One should spontaneously withdraw in disgust from sinful activities; then one is actually modest or humble. One who is satisfied in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thus does not seek material pleasure or suffer material unhappiness is considered to be actually situated in happiness. The most wretched person is one addicted to sex pleasure, and a wise man is one who knows the process of freedom from such material bondage. A fool is one who gives up his eternal friendship with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and instead identifies himself with his own temporary material body, mind, society, community and family. The real path in life is not simply a modern interstate highway or, in more simple cultures, a footpath free of thorns and mud. It is that path that leads to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The wrong path in life is not simply a road having many thieves or tollbooths; it is that path that leads one to utter confusion in material sense gratification. A heavenly situation is that in which the mode of goodness predominates, rather than that found on the planet of Indra, where passion and ignorance sometimes disturb the celestial atmosphere. Hell is anywhere the mode of ignorance is predominant, and not merely the hellish planets, where, according to Lord \u015aiva, a pure devotee can think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and remain happy. Our actual friend in life is the bona fide spiritual master, who saves us from all dangers. Among all gurus, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Himself the jagad-guru, or spiritual master of the entire universe. In material life our own material body is our immediate home, rather than some structure of bricks, cement, stone and wood. A rich man is one who possesses innumerable good qualities; he is not a neurotic fool with a large bank account. A poor man is one who is unsatisfied, which is self-explanatory. One who cannot control his senses is certainly wretched and miserable in life, whereas one who detaches himself from material life is actually a lord or controller. In modern times there are remnants of aristocracy in Europe and other countries, but such so-called lords often display the habits of lower forms of life. A real lord is one who conquers material existence by rising to the spiritual platform. A person who is attached to material life will undoubtedly manifest the opposites of all the good qualities mentioned here, and he is thus the symbol of going backward in life. The Lord concludes His analysis by stating that there is no need for further elaboration of these good and bad qualities. Indeed, the purpose of life is to transcend materially good and bad qualities and come to the liberated platform of pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This point will be further explained in the following chapter."
