Otherwise, the violent waves of sense gratification and mental speculation will undoubtedly sweep one away from one\u2019s eternal, constitutional position as the loving servitor of the Supreme Lord, and one will then fall down into the stringent bondage described here as uru-p\u0101\u015b\u0101t, \u201ca very powerful illusory network.\u201d"

        "purport": " The word durvibh\u0101vyam is significant here. The ultimate cause of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world is certainly inconceivable even for the greatest mundane scientists, who waste their lives in useless and fruitless speculation. Yet Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is the secondary expansion of an expansion of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, sees the entire cosmos to be like an insignificant atom. So what hope is there for foolish so-called scientists who try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by their ridiculous experimental power? Thus the word anavadya is used. No one can find fault or discrepancy in the body, character, activities or instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is never materially ignorant; therefore He never exhibits cruelty, laziness, foolishness, blindness or material intoxication. Similarly, because the Lord is never polluted by material passion, He never exhibits material pride, lamentation, yearning or violence. And since the Lord is free from material goodness, He never attempts to peacefully enjoy the material world with a sublime materialistic mentality. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as stated here (sve sukhe\u00a0\u2019vyavahite\u00a0\u2019bhirata\u1e25), is eternally busy, day and night, in His transcendental abode, relishing the inconceivable loving devotion of His innumerable associates. The Lord is being embraced and is embracing. He is joking and is hearing the joking of His loved ones. The Lord is walking through forests full of fruits and flowers, playing in the nectarean river Yamun\u0101 and taking part in His most confidential transcendental loving affairs with the cowherd girls of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. These pastimes in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka and on other Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are eternal, faultless and an ocean of spiritual happiness. The Lord never descends to the dry platform of relative material happiness. The infinite Personality of Godhead has nothing to gain from anyone; thus fruitive activity cannot possibly exist within the Lord."

Thus, they meditate upon Your Lordship in Your quadruple expansion. Your lotus feet are just like a blazing fire that burns to ashes all the inauspicious desires for material sense gratification.",
        "purport": " The conditioned living entity can purify his existence simply by having firm faith in the transcendental glories of the Personality of Godhead. What then can be said of the extraordinary good fortune of the demigods, who were directly seeing Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet? Although we are presently afflicted by innumerable material desires, these desires are temporary. The eternal living entity is meant to experience a loving relationship with the supreme living entity, the Personality of Godhead; and by rendering pure devotional service to the Lord, the heart of the living entity is completely satisfied. The word dh\u016bmaketu in this verse indicates a flaming comet or fire, which represents Lord \u015aiva. Lord \u015aiva is the master of the mode of ignorance, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet are compared to the comet, a symbol of the potency of \u015aiva, which can destroy all ignorance within the heart. The word sama-vibh\u016btaye (\u201cfor achieving equal opulence\u201d) indicates that the pure devotees go back home, back to Godhead, and enjoy the infinite bliss of the spiritual world. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is endowed with unlimited opulent paraphernalia for enjoyment, and a liberated soul who goes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode is awarded all opulence for serving the Lord. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the word vy\u016bhe in this verse indicates the three puru\u1e63a incarnations, namely Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, as well as V\u0101sudeva. If we can scientifically understand how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expands Himself to create the material world, we shall immediately experience that everything is the property of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thus become free from the desire to exploit it for our own selfish purposes. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord, the master of everyone and the reservoir of all opulences, and one should remember His lotus feet in the morning, at noon and in the evening. One who always remembers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and never forgets Him will experience real, blissful life beyond the pale shadow of material illusion."

The mystic yog\u012bs (adhy\u0101tma-yoga uta yogibhi\u1e25) are eager to acquire knowledge of the Lord\u2019s mystic potencies, whereas the pure devotees (parama-bh\u0101gavatai\u1e25) are eager to cross beyond the kingdom of illusion so that they can serve Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet in pure loving ecstasy. In any case, everyone is interested in the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The atheistic material scientists are also fascinated by the external material potency of the Lord, and the gross sense gratifiers are attracted by the physical body, which is also \u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101, or an expansion of the Lord\u2019s potency. Although all of the Lord\u2019s potencies are qualitatively one with the Lord, and therefore with each other, the blissful spiritual potency is nevertheless supreme because it establishes relationships between the Lord and the pure living entities on the platform of eternal happiness. Every living entity is originally a loving servitor of the Lord, and the spiritual energy of the Lord engages the living entity in his pure constitutional position beyond illusion. Our dreaming and waking experiences are both activities of the mind; however, the activities we perform while awake are more valuable because they establish us in our permanent situation. Similarly, at every moment every living entity is experiencing one of the innumerable potencies of the Supreme Lord. However, the experience of the spiritual potency is more significant because it establishes the living entity in his eternal, constitutional position as a faithful servitor of the Personality of Godhead. The demigods are glorifying the Lord\u2019s lotus feet because they are personally very eager to be purified by contact with those feet (tav\u0101\u1e45ghrir asm\u0101kam a\u015bubh\u0101\u015baya-dh\u016bmaketu\u1e25 sy\u0101t). When a sincere devotee eagerly desires to attain the shelter of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, the Lord brings him to His personal abode, just as the demigods were brought to Dv\u0101rak\u0101 by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s arrangement."

Since the goddess of fortune makes her abode on Your transcendental chest, she will undoubtedly become agitated, like a jealous co-wife, upon seeing our offering also dwelling there. Yet You are so merciful that You neglect Your eternal consort Lak\u1e63m\u012b and accept our offering as most excellent worship. O merciful Lord, may Your lotus feet always act as a blazing fire to consume the inauspicious desires within our hearts.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26) it is stated: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gratefully and happily accepts even the most meager offering from His loving devotee. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is conquered by the love of His pure devotees, just as a father is easily conquered by the most insignificant gift offered by his loving child. Unless a transcendentalist completely gives up the impersonal conception of life, he cannot make such a loving offering to the Lord. The process of meditation upon the Supersoul within the heart, called dhy\u0101na-yoga, is not as pleasing to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, because in dhy\u0101na, or meditation, the yog\u012b is trying to satisfy himself (and not the Lord) by attaining mystic powers. Similarly, in order to acquire material benefits from the Lord, ordinary people worship God in temples, churches and mosques. But one who desires actual spiritual perfection must be enlivened to always chant and hear the glories of the Lord. Such devotional enthusiasm is motivated by love of Godhead and is devoid of any selfish expectation. The Lord is so kind that He neglects His own eternal consort, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, and gives preference to His humble devotee, just as a man will neglect the loving embrace of his wife when his affectionate child approaches him with a gift. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has pointed out that any garland worn by the Lord cannot be faded because all of the Lord\u2019s personal paraphernalia is completely transcendental and spiritually opulent. Similarly, there is no possibility that mundane jealousy could appear in the character of the goddess of fortune, who is as transcendental as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Therefore the statements of the demigods are to be understood as humorous words inspired by intense love of Godhead. The demigods enjoy the protection of Lak\u1e63m\u012b and, ultimately, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and due to their confidence in their loving relationship with the Lord and His consort they feel free to speak in a joking way."

One may argue that all this has nothing to do with the Personality of Godhead since it is based on nothing more than the interaction of opposing living entities. But every living entity is, however, strictly under the control of the Personality of Godhead, and victory and defeat are always in the hands of the Lord.\u201d This does not contradict the fact of the living entity\u2019s free will, since the Lord awards victory and defeat according to the merit of the living entities. In a legal battle neither the prosecution nor the defense can act independently of the legal system presided over by the authorized judge. Victory and defeat in the court are awarded by the judge, but the judge is acting according to the laws, which do not favor or discriminate against either side. Similarly, the Personality of Godhead is awarding us the results of our previous activities. In order to discredit God, materialists frequently give the argument that oftentimes innocent people suffer whereas impious rogues enjoy life unimpeded. The fact is, however, that the Personality of Godhead is not a fool, as are the materialistic persons who place such arguments. The Lord can see our many previous lives; therefore He may allow one to enjoy or suffer in this life not only as a result of one\u2019s present activities, but also as a result of one\u2019s previous activities. For example, by working very hard a man may accumulate a fortune. If such a newly rich man then gives up his work and takes to a degenerate life, his fortune does not immediately disappear. On the other hand, one who is destined to become rich may now be working very hard, with discipline and austerity, and yet be without spending money. So a superficial observer might well be confused upon seeing the moral, hard-working man without funds and the degenerate, lazy man in possession of riches. Similarly, a materialistic fool without knowledge of past, present and future is unable to understand the perfect justice of the Personality of Godhead. The example given in this verse to explain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s controlling power is appropriate. Although a bull is extremely powerful, he is easily controlled by a slight tug on a rope strung through his pierced nose. Similarly, even the most powerful politicians, scholars, demigods, etc., may immediately be put into an unbearable situation by the omnipotent Personality of Godhead. Therefore the demigods have not come to Dv\u0101rak\u0101 to proudly display their universal political and intellectual powers but to humbly surrender at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead."

We observe that by the laws of nature all material things, including our own bodies, gradually disintegrate. Although we can perceive the long-term results of this aging process, we cannot experience the process itself. For example, no one can feel how his hair or fingernails are growing. We perceive the cumulative result of their growth, but from moment to moment we cannot experience it. Similarly, a house gradually decays until it is demolished. From moment to moment we cannot perceive exactly how this is happening, but in the course of longer intervals of time we can actually see the deterioration of the house. In other words, we can experience the results or manifestations of aging and deterioration, but as it is taking place the process itself is imperceptible. This is the wonderful potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of time. The word tri-\u1e47\u0101bhi\u1e25 indicates that according to astrological calculation of the sun\u2019s movements, the year can be divided into three sections: those represented by Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer; Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio; and Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.

        "translation": "My Lord, You are living with sixteen thousand exquisitely beautiful, aristocratic wives. By their irresistible coy and smiling glances and by their lovely arching eyebrows, they send You messages of eager conjugal love. But they are completely unable to disturb the mind and senses of Your Lordship.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse it was clearly stated that no material object can attract the senses of the Lord. Now in this verse it is demonstrated that the Lord has no desire to enjoy even spiritual sense gratification. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is complete in Himself. He is the reservoir of all pleasure, and He does not lust after anything material or spiritual. The argument may be given that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in order to please His wife Satyabh\u0101m\u0101, stole a p\u0101rij\u0101ta flower from heaven and thus appeared to be a henpecked husband under the control of His loving wife. But although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sometimes conquered by the love of His devotees, He is never influenced by the desire to enjoy like an ordinary, lusty materialistic person. The nondevotees cannot understand the overwhelming loving feelings exchanged between the Lord and His pure devotees. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may be conquered by our intense love for Him, and thus pure devotees can control the Lord. For example, the elderly gop\u012bs in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana would clap their hands in different rhythms to make K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a dance, and in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 Satyabh\u0101m\u0101 ordered K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to bring her a flower as proof of His love for her. As stated in \u015ar\u012bniv\u0101sa \u0100c\u0101rya\u2019s song to the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, gop\u012b-bh\u0101va-ras\u0101m\u1e5bt\u0101bdhi-lahar\u012b-kallola-magnau muhu\u1e25: the love between the Lord and His pure devotee is an ocean of spiritual bliss. But at the same time, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remains completely self-satisfied. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indifferently gave up the company of the incomparable young damsels of Vraja-bh\u016bmi, the gop\u012bs, and went to Mathur\u0101 at the request of His uncle, Akr\u016bra. Thus neither the gop\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana nor the queens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 could arouse an enjoying spirit in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When all is said and done, pleasure in this world means sex. But this mundane sexual attraction is simply a perverted reflection of the transcendental loving affairs between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His eternal associates in the spiritual world. The gop\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are unsophisticated village girls, whereas the queens in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 are aristocratic young ladies. But both the gop\u012bs and the queens are overwhelmed with love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a displays the highest perfection of beauty, strength, wealth, fame, knowledge and renunciation and is thus completely satisfied by His own supreme position. He reciprocates spiritual loving affairs with the gop\u012bs and queens simply for their sake. Only fools think that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could be attracted by the perverted illusory pleasures to which we poor conditioned souls are so blindly attached. Therefore everyone should recognize the supreme transcendental position of the Personality of Godhead and surrender to Him. That is the clear implication of this statement by the demigods."

Those who are striving for purification associate with the holy narrations of Your glories by hearing them with their ears, and they associate with the holy rivers flowing from Your lotus feet by physically bathing in them.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura states, \u0101nu\u015brava\u1e41 guror ucc\u0101ra\u1e47am anu\u015br\u016byante: \u201cOne should hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by hearing from the spiritual master.\u201d The bona fide spiritual master describes the pastimes, potencies and incarnations of the Personality of Godhead to his disciple. If the spiritual master is bona fide and if the disciple is sincere and obedient, then the communication between guru and disciple is just like nectar, both for the guru and the disciple. Ordinary persons cannot even imagine the special pleasure experienced by the devotees of the Lord. Such nectarean speaking and hearing destroys all contamination within the heart of a conditioned soul, the primary contamination being the desire to live without serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The other nectar described here is cara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta, the nectarean waters that bathe the Lord\u2019s feet. Lord V\u0101manadeva bathed His own lotus foot by kicking a hole in the universal covering so that the sacred Ganges water washed His toes and fell into the universe. The Yamun\u0101 River also washed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet when the Lord appeared on this planet five thousand years ago. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sported daily with His boyfriends and girlfriends in the Yamun\u0101 River, and consequently that river is also cara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta. One should therefore try to take bath in the Ganges or Yamun\u0101. Every morning in ISKCON temples, the lotus feet of the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are bathed, and the water thus sanctified is also called cara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta, the nectar of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da taught his disciples and followers to come before the Deities each morning and drink three drops of the cara\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bta from the Deities\u2019 bathing. In all these ways one can purify his heart and relish spiritual bliss. When one is fixed on the platform of spiritual bliss, then one does not take another birth in the material world. In this verse the word \u015buci-\u1e63ada\u1e25 is significant: one must engage in the purified activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One must learn to serve the Lord from the bona fide spiritual master, whose instructions one should accept without speculation. Those who are attached to the phantasmagoria of this world sometimes concoct their own whimsical concepts of God. But only from the bona fide spiritual master can we get perfect and pure knowledge about the Supreme Personality of Godhead and devotional service to Him. Such knowledge may be found in all the books of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da."

        "purport": " Unfortunately, in Kali-yuga many persons are not attracted to the authorized Vedic literatures. Minimizing the transcendental process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Personality of Godhead, they prefer to listen to useless and whimsical vibrations on the radio and television, in newspapers and magazines, and so on. Rather than hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the bona fide spiritual master, they endlessly give their own opinions about everything, until they are dragged away by the force of time. After studying the temporary, limited forms of the material world, they impatiently conclude that the Absolute Truth is formless. Such persons are actually worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s illusory energy, m\u0101y\u0101, who has been authorized to kick their stubborn heads. If instead people hear directly about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the bona fide sources, they will very easily solve all the problems of their lives. In Kali-yuga people are constantly suffering from many psychological, social, economic, historical, political and existential problems. But all these nightmarish problems can be removed as soon as one awakens to the transcendental reality of the Personality of Godhead, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge and beyond the bewildering manifestations of the material energy. The Lord appears within this universe so that people can observe, hear about and glorify His actual activities. In this difficult Age of Kali we should all seriously take advantage of this opportunity."

        "purport": " Just as a tidal wave overwhelms the boundary of the shore and wreaks havoc on innocent people, similarly, there was imminent danger that the powerful Yadu dynasty might expand beyond all boundaries of social and political control. The members of the Yadu dynasty had become proud because of their apparent familial relationship with the Personality of Godhead. Although they were very religious and devoted to brahminical culture, they had become, as indicated by the word d\u1e5bpt\u0101n\u0101m, affected by pride due to their relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Furthermore, due to their intense love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they would certainly feel such intense separation after the Lord\u2019s departure to the spiritual world that they would become maddened and thus become an unbearable burden on the earth. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out, however, that the earth herself, due to attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, would never consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s own family members to be anything but a welcome burden. Still, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to remove this burden. The example is given that for the pleasure of her husband a beautiful young wife may decorate herself with many golden ornaments. These ornaments constitute a painful burden for the delicate wife, but although she is willing to bear this burden, the loving husband removes the ornaments for the pleasure of his wife. So the Lord, desiring to apply the wisdom of \u201cAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\u201d took precautions to remove from the earth the burden of the Yadu dynasty."

When the Lord had completed His earthly pastimes He wanted to send these demigods back to their previous service in universal administration. Each demigod was to return to his respective planet. The transcendental city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 is so auspicious that whoever dies there immediately goes back home, back to Godhead, but because the demigod members of the Yadu dynasty, in many cases, were not yet prepared to go back to Godhead, they had to die outside the city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, pretending to be an ordinary living being, said, \u201cWe are all in danger. Let us all immediately go to Prabh\u0101sa.\u201d In this way, by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a bewildered such demigod members of the Yadu dynasty and led them away to the holy place Prabh\u0101sa. Since Dv\u0101rak\u0101 is parama-ma\u1e45gala, the most auspicious place, not even an imitation of inauspiciousness can take place there. Actually, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastime of removing the Yadu dynasty is ultimately auspicious, but since it outwardly appeared inauspicious, it could not take place in Dv\u0101rak\u0101; therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a led the Yadus away from Dv\u0101rak\u0101. After having sent the demigods back to their planets, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a planned to return to the spiritual world, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, in His original form and remain in the eternal city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has made the following important comments on this verse. Prabh\u0101sa is a famous holy place located near the Veraval railway station, within the region of Junagarah. In Chapter Thirty of the Eleventh Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is written that after hearing the words of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Y\u0101davas went to the mainland from the island city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 by means of boats and then traveled to Prabh\u0101sa in chariots. At Prabh\u0101sa-k\u1e63etra they drank a beverage called maireya and became engaged in a mutual quarrel. A great battle ensued, and killing each other with hard stalks of cane, the members of the Yadu dynasty acted out the pastime of their own annihilation. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, manifesting His four-armed form, sat down under a pippala tree, placing His left foot, the heel of which was colored red like the red koka-nada lotus, upon His right thigh. A hunter named Jar\u0101, watching from the shore of the ocean at Prabh\u0101sa, mistook the Lord\u2019s red-colored foot to be the face of a deer and shot his arrow at it. At the base of that same pippala tree under which Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had sat there is now a temple. One mile away from the tree, on the seashore, is the V\u012bra-prabha\u00f1jana Ma\u1e6dha, and it is said that from this point the hunter Jar\u0101 fired his arrow. In the conclusion to his work Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata-t\u0101tparya-nir\u1e47aya, \u015ar\u012b Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya-p\u0101da has written the following purport to the mau\u1e63ala-l\u012bl\u0101. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in order to bewilder the demons and ensure that the word of His own devotees and of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as be maintained, created a body of material energy into which the arrow was shot. But the Lord\u2019s actual four-armed form was never touched by the arrow of Jar\u0101, who is actually the Lord\u2019s devotee Bh\u1e5bgu \u1e5a\u1e63i. In a previous age Bh\u1e5bgu Muni had placed his foot on the chest of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In order to counteract the offense of improperly placing his foot on the Lord\u2019s chest, Bh\u1e5bgu had to take birth as a degraded hunter. But even though a great devotee willingly accepts such a low birth, the Personality of Godhead cannot tolerate seeing His devotee in such a fallen condition. Thus the Personality of Godhead arranged that at the end of Dv\u0101para-yuga, when the Lord was winding up His manifest pastimes, His devotee Bh\u1e5bgu, in the form of the hunter Jar\u0101, would cast the arrow into a material body created by the Lord\u2019s illusory energy. Thus the hunter would become remorseful, gain release from his degraded birth and go back to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-loka. Therefore, to please His devotee Bh\u1e5bgu and to confuse the demons, the Supreme Lord manifested His mau\u1e63ala-l\u012bl\u0101 at Prabh\u0101sa, but it should be understood that this is an illusory pastime. The Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, from His very appearance on the earth, did not manifest any of the material qualities of ordinary human beings. The Lord did not appear from the womb of His mother. Rather, by His inconceivable power He descended into the maternity room. At the time of His giving up this mortal world, He similarly manifested an illusory situation for the sake of bewildering the demons. To bewilder the nondevotees, the Lord created an illusory body out of His material energy while simultaneously remaining personally in His own sac-cid-\u0101nanda body, and thus He manifested the downfall of an illusory material form. This pretense effectively bewilders foolish demons, but Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s actual transcendental, eternal body of bliss never experiences death. Also at Prabh\u0101sa-k\u1e63etra there is the holy place known as Bh\u1e5bgu-t\u012brtha, which was manifested by Lord Para\u015bur\u0101ma. The place at which the two rivers Sarasvat\u012b and Hira\u1e47y\u0101 flow together into the ocean is named Bh\u1e5bgu-t\u012brtha, and there the hunter cast his arrow. There is an elaborate description of Prabh\u0101sa-t\u012brtha in the Prabh\u0101sa-kha\u1e47\u1e0da of the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a. There are also many phala-\u015brutis given within the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata in connection with Prabh\u0101sa-t\u012brtha. Phala-\u015brutis are scriptural statements that promise various auspicious results for one who performs a particular pious activity. In the following verses the Lord Himself will explain the particular benefits to be derived from visiting Prabh\u0101sa-k\u1e63etra and performing religious activities there."

My Lord, it appears that You will now withdraw Your dynasty, and thus You Yourself will finally give up Your pastimes within this universe. You are the supreme controller and the master of all mystic power. But although You are fully capable of counteracting the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 curse against Your dynasty, You are not doing so, and Your disappearance is imminent.",
        "purport": " As previously mentioned, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s own dynasty can never be destroyed; therefore the word sa\u1e41h\u1e5btya means that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was taking the Y\u0101davas with Him as He left this material world. However, in the eyes of ordinary, unenlightened persons the withdrawal of the Yadu dynasty appears to be its destruction. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has very nicely explained the statement of Uddhava as follows. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is addressed as deva-deva, or the supreme God among the gods, because He expertly solved all of the problems of the demigods by His incarnation within the universe. The Lord rid the world of demons and firmly established both His devotees and religious principles. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is addressed here as yoge\u015ba because He not only performed work on behalf of the demigods, but also revealed His beautiful, transcendental form, full of transcendental qualities and ecstasies, for the pleasure of His pure devotees. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana because when by His internal mystic potency He exhibited His humanlike activities, the Lord stimulated the writing of innumerable Vedic scriptures about His pastimes. Thus persons who would be born in the future, like ourselves, would be able to hear and chant about the Lord\u2019s activities and also go back home, back to Godhead. Having insured the transcendental bliss and liberation of all of His devotees, even those who would be born in the future, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a decided the time had come for Him to leave this material universe. Uddhava could understand the Lord\u2019s desire and said to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cYou have instructed the Y\u0101davas to counteract the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 curse by taking bath at Prabh\u0101sak\u1e63etra, but how could mere bathing in a holy place be of greater value than seeing You, the Personality of Godhead, face to face? Since the Y\u0101davas are always seeing Your transcendental form, and since You are the Supreme Lord, what is the use of their taking bath in a so-called holy place? Therefore You obviously have some other purpose. If You actually wanted to counteract the curse, You could simply say, \u2018Let this curse not act,\u2019 and the curse would immediately be neutralized. Therefore You must be preparing to leave this universe, and that is why You have not counteracted the curse.\u201d"

        "purport": " Uddhava understood that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was going to withdraw the Yadu dynasty, and thus he begged the Lord to take him along to the Lord\u2019s abode. He had no desire to merge into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s impersonal effulgence; instead he wanted to go to the Lord\u2019s spiritual abode and continue associating with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as His dearmost friend. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Personality of Godhead and can do whatever He likes, but the devotee begs the Lord for the chance to serve Him. Although the Lord manifests within the material world His various abodes, such as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Dv\u0101rak\u0101 and Mathur\u0101, and although these are certainly nondifferent from their counterparts in the spiritual world, the most advanced devotees, overwhelmed with desire to personally serve the Lord, are very eager to go to the Lord\u2019s original spiritual planet. As stated by Lord Kapila in the Third Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the pure devotees have no desire for liberation. Because of their eagerness to render service, they urge the Lord to appear before them. The six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, due to their intense eagerness to serve R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, urgently searched after Them, calling out Their names in the forests of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Similarly, Uddhava is urging the Lord to take him to His own abode so that Uddhava\u2019s personal service to the Lord\u2019s lotus feet will not be interrupted even for a moment. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that immature conditioned souls think that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary j\u012bva soul engaged in material activities and was thus unable to protect His own dynasty from the curse of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Uddhava\u2019s statement corrects such unfortunate persons. It is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself who awarded pious living entities birth in brahminical families, and then Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a further awarded them the potency to curse His dynasty. And finally, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally kept the curse intact, although He was capable of neutralizing it. Therefore in the beginning, middle and end, directly and indirectly, in the past, present and future, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is completely transcendental to even the slightest touch of material illusion or impotence."

Also it is stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam, \u0101ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25/ patanty adho\u00a0\u2019n\u0101d\u1e5bta-yu\u1e63mad-a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25. K\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a: with great struggle and trouble the yog\u012bs climb their way up into the impersonal effulgence called brahmajyoti, but again they slip out of the jyoti and fall back into the material world because they do not take shelter of the Personality of Godhead. Envious fools object to the \u201cpaternalism\u201d of the Personality of Godhead, but these fools cannot take credit for the creation of their own body, brain or energy, nor can they claim credit for the air, rain, vegetables, fruits, sun, moon, and so on. In other words, they are totally dependent on the mercy of God at every second, and yet they arrogantly state that they do not want to accept the shelter of the Lord, because they are self-sufficient. In fact, some bewildered living entities even think that they themselves are God, although they cannot explain why \u201cGod\u201d has to struggle and toil to achieve meager success in the yoga system. Therefore Uddhava is pointing out that, unlike the impersonalists and meditators, the pure devotees very easily cross over the illusory energy because they are totally attached to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always transcendental, and if one is firmly attached to the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, then he is also transcendental. The causeless mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is more valuable than millions and billions of years of one\u2019s own struggling and straining. One should try to get the Lord\u2019s mercy, and then everything will become very easy on the path of spiritual realization. In this age one can achieve the mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by constantly chanting His holy name, as recommended in the \u015b\u0101stra: If one constantly chants Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s holy names, avoiding offenses against the names, then surely one will achieve the same result as Uddhava. Uddhava was not interested in so-called Brahman realization, but rather he wanted to go on drinking the maddening nectar of the beautiful smiling of the Lord\u2019s moonlike face."

We ecstatically recall Your amorous pastimes with Your confidential conjugal devotees and how You boldly smile and move about while engaged in such youthful pastimes.

Still, Uddhava is confident that he will certainly cross over the illusory energy because he is addicted to chanting and remembering the glorious activities and words of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated: Although one may outwardly appear to be involved in this material world, if one is always engaged, twenty-four hours a day, in the service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then one is considered to be a liberated soul. Uddhava states here that hearing and chanting the holy name and pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is infinitely more effective than becoming a naked yog\u012b in the forest and running the constant risk of becoming, due to lusty desires and sex indulgence, a naked monkey in the forest. Uddhava is begging the Lord for the mercy of His Sudar\u015bana cakra, whose effulgence is represented by the process of remembering and chanting the pastimes of the Lord. One who absorbs himself in the incomparable bliss of thinking of the Lord\u2019s abode easily becomes free from all lamentation, illusion and fear. That is the recommendation of \u015ar\u012b Uddhava."
