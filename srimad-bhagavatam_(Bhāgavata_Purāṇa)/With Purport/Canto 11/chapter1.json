        "translation": "\u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b said: Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, accompanied by Balar\u0101ma and surrounded by the Yadu dynasty, executed the killing of many demons. Then, further to remove the burden of the earth, the Lord arranged for the great Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, which suddenly erupted in violence between the Kurus and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas.",
        "purport": " The Eleventh Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam begins with a reference to the pastimes executed by Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the Tenth Canto. The beginning of the Tenth Canto describes that when the earth was overburdened by demoniac rulers, the personified earth, Bh\u016bmi, approached Lord Brahm\u0101 with tears in her eyes, begging for relief, and Brahm\u0101 immediately went with the demigods to approach the Supreme Lord in His form of K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. As the demigods waited respectfully on the shore of the Milk Ocean, the Supreme Lord announced through Brahm\u0101 that He would soon incarnate on earth and that the demigods should also descend to assist in His pastimes. Thus from the very beginning of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance it was understood that He would descend to the earth to remove the demons. As \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da states in his commentary to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.6), those who agree to obey the injunctions of revealed scriptures are known as demigods, whereas those who defy the orders of Vedic scriptures are known as asuras, or demons. The Vedic literatures are presented within the universe for the guidance of the conditioned souls, who are trapped under the three modes of material nature and who are therefore rotating in a continuous cycle of birth and death. By strictly adhering to the Vedic injunctions, we can easily satisfy our material needs and at the same time make tangible progress on the path back home, back to Godhead. Thus we can achieve an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in the Lord\u2019s own abode simply by obeying the Lord\u2019s instructions as they are presented in Vedic literatures such as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The demons, however, minimize or even mock the absolute authority of the Supreme Lord and His teachings. Because these asuras envy the sovereign status of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they minimize the importance of the Vedic scriptures, which emanate directly from the breathing of the Lord. The demons establish a society governed by their own concocted whims and inevitably create chaos and misery, especially for pious living entities who sincerely desire to follow the will of God. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that when there is a predominance of such chaotic, irreligious societies on the earth, He personally descends to rectify the imbalance. Thus from the very beginning of His transcendental infancy, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a systematically killed the powerful asuras, or demons, who were an intolerable burden for the earth. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was assisted by His brother, Balar\u0101ma, who is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although God is one, He can expand Himself to enjoy in many forms at once. That is His omnipotence. And the first such expansion is Balar\u0101ma, or Baladeva. Balar\u0101ma killed many noteworthy demons, including Dhenuk\u0101sura, Dvivida and the envious Rukm\u012b. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was also accompanied by the members of the Yadu dynasty, many of whom were demigods who had descended to assist the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, however, has revealed that although many demigods had taken birth in the Yadu dynasty to assist the Lord, some members of the Yadu dynasty were actually inimical toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Because of their mundane vision of the Lord, they considered themselves to be on the same level as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Having taken birth in the family of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, they had inconceivable strength, and thus they misunderstood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme position. Having forgotten that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they would constitute a great burden, and consequently it was necessary for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to remove them from the earth. There is a popular saying that familiarity breeds contempt. To destroy the contemptuous members of His own dynasty, the Lord caused a quarrel among them. For this purpose, He arranged for N\u0101rada and other sages to display anger against the K\u0101r\u1e63\u1e47as, the members of His family. Although many Yadus who were devoted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were apparently killed in this fratricidal war, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a actually returned them to their original positions as universal directors, or demigods. It is the Lord\u2019s promise in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that He will always protect those who are favorable to His service. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, in his commentary on this verse, has given a summary of the entire Eleventh Canto as follows. Chapter One describes the beginning of the mau\u1e63ala-l\u012bl\u0101, or the prelude to the destruction of the Yadu dynasty. Chapters Two through Five describe the conversations between the nine Yogendras and King Nimi. Chapter Six describes the prayers of Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and other residents of heaven. Chapters Seven through Twenty-nine present the conversation between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Uddhava that is known as the Uddhava-g\u012bt\u0101. Chapter Thirty describes the withdrawal of the Yadu dynasty from the earth. The final chapter describes the disappearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

On the pretext of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a arranged for all the kings who were burdening the earth to assemble with their armies on opposite sides of the battlefield, and when the Lord killed them through the agency of war, the earth was relieved of its burden.",
        "purport": " The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were repeatedly harassed by their enemies, such as Duryodhana and Du\u1e25\u015b\u0101sana. As innocent young princes, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas had no enemy, but Duryodhana was constantly plotting against his helpless cousins. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were sent to a house of lac, which was later burned to the ground. They were administered poison, and their chaste wife Draupad\u012b was publicly insulted when her hair was pulled and an attempt was made to strip her naked. Throughout these dangers, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constantly protected the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were fully surrendered to Him and who knew no shelter other than Him. In this verse the word itaretarata\u1e25 is significant. Previous to the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had personally killed many demons, including P\u016btan\u0101, Ke\u015b\u012b, Agh\u0101sura and Ka\u1e41sa. Now, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to complete His mission of removing the earth\u2019s burden by killing the remaining impious persons. But as stated here, k\u1e5btv\u0101 nimittam: the Lord did not personally kill, but empowered His devotees Arjuna and the other P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas to remove the impious kings. Thus acting personally and through His immediate expansion Balar\u0101ma, as well as by empowering His pure devotees such as the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fully displayed the pastimes of the yug\u0101vat\u0101ra by reestablishing religious principles and ridding the world of demons. Although the general purpose of the Kuruk\u1e63etra battle was to kill the demons, by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s arrangement some great devotees such as Bh\u012b\u1e63ma also appeared to be inimical toward the Lord. But as described in the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.9.39) by the words hat\u0101 gat\u0101\u1e25 svar\u016bpam, many great devotees played with the Lord as enemies and upon being killed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a returned immediately to His abode in the spiritual sky in their original spiritual bodies. Because God is absolute, by His killing He simultaneously removes the demons from the earth and encourages His pure devotees."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead used the Yadu dynasty, which was protected by His own arms, to eliminate the kings who with their armies had been the burden of this earth. Then the unfathomable Lord thought to Himself, \u201cAlthough some may say that the earth\u2019s burden is now gone, in My opinion it is not yet gone, because there still remains the Y\u0101dava dynasty itself, whose strength is unbearable for the earth.\u201d",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has remarked in this regard that although ordinary people might think that the Lord had now removed the burden of the earth by killing the demons, reestablishing dharma, and so on, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself could detect that there was further danger from the irreligious activities of His own family members who were acting improperly. It is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that a just king will refuse to punish his own enemy if his enemy is innocent but will punish his own son if his son actually deserves punishment. Thus although in the eyes of the world the members of the Lord\u2019s own dynasty are always worshipable, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a detected that by their intimate association with Him some members of the Yadu dynasty had become indifferent to His will. Since such whimsical members of the Yadu dynasty could act freely, being relatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they would surely cause great misfortune for the world, and foolish persons would take such whimsical behavior to be the will of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the Lord, whose desires are inconceivable, began to consider the need to annihilate the indifferent, contemptuous members of the Yadu family. From the viewpoint of ordinary persons, all the demons had been killed by the Supreme Lord\u2019s pastimes in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 and Mathur\u0101, as well as by the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and the earth was now free of its burden. Nevertheless, to free the earth from the remaining burden of His own puffed-up family members, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a transferred them away from the earth by causing a fratricidal quarrel among them. In this way He prepared for His own disappearance from the earth. \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has pointed out that the word b\u0101hubhi\u1e25, \u201cby His arms,\u201d is used in the plural (rather than the dual) to indicate that the Lord caused the destruction of the Yadu dynasty in His four-armed form. The original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Govinda is two-armed, but it was by the plenary portion of the four-armed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a that the Lord killed all the demons on the earth and ultimately removed the burdensome members of His own family. It may be asked, If certain members of the Yadu family had become indifferent to the will of the Lord, why didn\u2019t they oppose the Lord in His plan to remove them from the earth? Therefore the word aprameya\u1e25 is used, which indicates that it is impossible for anyone, even the Lord\u2019s own family members, to understand His will completely. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has given another reason for the destruction of the Yadu dynasty. He emphasizes that the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead should never be taken to be ordinary material activities. Nor are the Lord\u2019s associates ordinary persons. Although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a apparently incarnates within this world for some time and then goes away, it should be understood that the Supreme Lord is eternally situated with His entourage in His various abodes in the spiritual sky, such as \u015ar\u012b Gokula, Mathur\u0101 and Dv\u0101rak\u0101. The members of the Yadu dynasty are eternal associates of the Lord, and therefore they cannot bear to be separated from the Lord. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was preparing to give up His earthly pastimes, if He were to leave the Yadu dynasty on the earth they would surely become so disturbed by His absence that in their highly agitated state of mind they would trample and destroy the earth. Therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a arranged the disappearance of the Yadu dynasty prior to His own disappearance. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b concludes that ultimately the members of the Yadu dynasty are never to be considered irreligious. Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas have mentioned that the story of the disappearance of the Yadu dynasty is especially meant to help the conditioned souls achieve liberation from the bondage of materialistic life. Within the three worlds there were none as powerful and opulent as the Yadu dynasty. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the possessor of unlimited opulences \u2014 beauty, strength, knowledge, fame and so on \u2014 and the members of the Yadu dynasty, being the personal associates of the Lord, were also endowed with inconceivable opulences. Therefore, when we see how a fratricidal war suddenly deprived the members of the Yadu dynasty of all of their earthly possessions and even their lives, we can understand that there is no permanent position within this material world. In other words, although the members of the Yadu dynasty are eternal associates of the Lord and were immediately transferred to another planet where the Lord was appearing, their sudden disappearance through fratricidal war is meant to impress upon the conditioned souls the temporary nature of this world. Therefore, the apparent indifference or enmity of certain members of the Yadu dynasty toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should not be taken to be actual irreligion on their part. The entire situation was arranged by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to teach a lesson to the conditioned souls. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has cited several verses from the Bh\u0101gavatam to prove that the members of the Yadu dynasty achieved their exalted birth in the Lord\u2019s own family by innumerable pious activities and by complete absorption in thought of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In fact it is said that in sleeping, sitting, walking and speaking, they were unable to remember their own selves, because they were simply thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.15.33), \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has commented as follows on the disappearance of the Yadu dynasty: \u201cThe setting of the sun does not mean the end of the sun. It means that the sun is out of our sight. Similarly, the end of the mission of the Lord on a particular planet or universe only means that He is out of our sight. The end of the Yadu dynasty also does not mean that it is annihilated. It disappears along with the Lord, out of our sight.\u201d"

        "translation": "Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thought, \u201cNo outside force could ever bring about the defeat of this family, the Yadu dynasty, whose members have always been fully surrendered to Me and are unrestricted in their opulence. But if I inspire a quarrel within the dynasty, that quarrel will act just like a fire created from the friction of bamboo in a grove, and then I shall achieve My real purpose and return to My eternal abode.\u201d",
        "purport": " Even though Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to arrange for the disappearance of the members of the Yadu dynasty, He could not personally kill them, as He had killed many demons, because the Yadu dynasty was His own family. One might ask why Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not arrange for them to be killed by others. Therefore it is stated in this verse, naiv\u0101nyata\u1e25 paribhavo\u00a0\u2019sya bhavet katha\u00f1cit: because the Yadu dynasty was the Lord\u2019s own family, no one within the universe was capable of killing them, not even the demigods. In fact, Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura points out that no one within the universe was capable of even insulting the members of the Yadu dynasty, what to speak of defeating or killing them. The reason is given here by the words mat-sa\u1e41\u015brayasya. The members of the Yadu dynasty had fully taken shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore they were always under the personal protection of the Lord. It is stated, m\u0101re k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a r\u0101khe ke, r\u0101khe k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a m\u0101re ke: If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a protects someone, no one can kill him, and if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants to kill someone, no one can save him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had originally requested all of His associates, along with the demigods, to appear on the earth to assist Him in His pastimes. Now that His pastimes were coming to an end on this particular planet and would be transferred to another planet in another universe, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to remove all of His associates from the earth so that in His absence they would not constitute a burden. Since the powerful Yadu dynasty, being the Lord\u2019s personal family and army, could not possibly be defeated by anyone, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a arranged an internal quarrel, just as the wind in a bamboo forest sometimes rubs the bamboos together and creates a fire that consumes the entire forest. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b has pointed out that ordinary people, hearing of the adventures of the Yadu family, might think that the heroes of the Yadu dynasty are as worshipable as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or that they are independent controllers. In other words, people polluted by M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy might see the Yadu dynasty as being on the same level as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, to establish that even the most powerful living entity can never equal or surpass the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a arranged for the destruction of the Yadu dynasty."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has made a very important comment on this verse. He states that since the intentions of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47acandra, are always perfect, it was certainly in consideration of the greatest benefit for the entire world that He destroyed His own family on the pretext of a curse by br\u0101hma\u1e47as. In this connection, Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has shown a parallel in the pastimes of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself appearing as His own devotee. Lord Caitanya appeared along with His first plenary expansion, known as Lord Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu, and with Lord Advaita Prabhu. All three personalities \u2014 Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu and Advaita Prabhu \u2014 are accepted by Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas to be in the category of vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, the full status of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These three Personalities of Godhead perceived that in the future Their so-called seminal descendants would get undue recognition and thus, being puffed up, would commit grave offenses against those who were actually Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava gurus or representatives of the Lord. Every living being is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25). Every living entity is originally a son of God, yet to execute His pastimes the Lord selects certain highly qualified living entities whom He allows to take birth as His personal relatives. But those living entities who appear as descendants of the Lord\u2019s personal family may undoubtedly become proud of such a position and thus abuse the great adulation they receive from ordinary people. In this way such persons may artificially get undue attention and divert people from the actual principle of spiritual advancement, which is to surrender to the pure devotee who represents the Lord. The last eight verses of the Twelfth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 give a description of the pure devotees the Lord permits to act as \u0101c\u0101ryas, or spiritual leaders of mankind. In other words, simply to take birth in the personal family of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not the qualification for being a spiritual master, since according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, pit\u0101ham asya jagata\u1e25: every living entity is eternally a member of the Lord\u2019s family. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, samo\u00a0\u2019ha\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u na me dve\u1e63yo\u00a0\u2019sti na priya\u1e25: \u201cI am equal to everyone. No one is My enemy, and no one is My special friend.\u201d If the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears to have a special family, such as the Yadu dynasty, such a so-called family is a special arrangement of the Lord\u2019s pastimes in order to attract the conditioned souls. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends, He acts as if He were an ordinary person in order to attract the living entities to His pastimes. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a acted as though the Yadu dynasty was His personal family, although in fact every living entity is a member of His family. Ordinary people, however, not understanding the higher principles of spiritual knowledge, easily forget the actual qualifications of a bona fide spiritual master and instead give undue importance to people born in the Lord\u2019s so-called family. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, therefore, avoided this impediment on the path of spiritual enlightenment by leaving behind no children. Although Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu married twice, He was childless. Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu, who is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, did not accept any of the natural sons born of His own son, \u015ar\u012b V\u012brabhadra. Similarly, Lord Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya divested of His association all of His sons except Acyut\u0101nanda and two others. Acyut\u0101nanda, the chief faithful son of Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya, had no seminal progeny, and the remaining three of the six sons of Lord Advaita fell from the path of devotion to the Lord and are known as rejected sons. In other words, the appearance of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu allowed little facility for continuing a so-called seminal family to create confusion. The respect shown to the conception of seminal lineage in deference to the ideas of the sm\u0101rtas is unfit to be accepted by one who actually understands the supreme truth from Vedic authority. Other \u0101c\u0101ryas, or spiritual masters, have also demonstrated this point in their own families. His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da, our own beloved spiritual master, who is the mighty author of this \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam series, was born in a family of pure devotees, and he himself exhibited all the symptoms of pure devotional service from his very childhood. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da eventually came to the Western countries and exhibited unprecedented spiritual potency in establishing the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement all over the world. In a few short years, he translated more than fifty large volumes of Vedic philosophy. By his practical activities he is certainly understood to be a most empowered representative of the Lord. Nonetheless, his own family members, although devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, did not at all come up to the proper standard of devotional service and are therefore not given attention by the members of ISKCON. The natural tendency for the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness would be to offer all reverence and worship to the members of \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da\u2019s immediate family. But since by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s arrangement these family members are not at all on the platform of pure devotional service, the members of ISKCON give them hardly any attention but instead worship those who actually exhibit the qualities of highly advanced Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, regardless of their so-called birth. In other words, birth cannot constitute the qualification for a respectable person, even when one is born in the Lord\u2019s own family or in the \u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s family, what to speak of an ordinary wealthy or learned family. In India there is a class of men known as nity\u0101nanda-va\u1e41\u015ba, who claim to be direct descendants of Lord Nity\u0101nanda and therefore worthy of the highest respect for their position in devotional service. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has written in The Nectar of Devotion, \u201cIn the Middle Ages, after the disappearance of Lord Caitanya\u2019s great associate Lord Nity\u0101nanda, a class of priestly persons claimed to be the descendants of Nity\u0101nanda, calling themselves the gosv\u0101m\u012b caste. They further claimed that the practice and spreading of devotional service belonged only to their particular class, which was known as nity\u0101nanda-va\u1e41\u015ba. In this way they exercised their artificial power for some time, until \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the powerful \u0101c\u0101rya of the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava samprad\u0101ya, completely smashed their idea. There was a great hard struggle for some time, but it has turned out successful, and it is now correctly and practically established that devotional service is not restricted to a particular class of men. Besides that, anyone who is engaged in devotional service is already a high-class br\u0101hma\u1e47a. So \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura\u2019s struggle for this movement has come out successful. It is on the basis of his position that anyone, from any part of the universe, can become a Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava.\u201d In other words, the essence of spiritual knowledge is that every living being, regardless of his present status in life, is originally a servant of the Supreme Lord, and it is the mission of the Lord to reclaim all of these fallen living entities. Despite his past situation, any living being who is willing to surrender again at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord or His bona fide representative can purify himself by strictly adhering to the rules and regulations of bhakti-yoga and thus act as a high-class br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Nonetheless, the seminal descendants of the Lord think themselves to have acquired their ancestor\u2019s character and position. Thus the Supreme Lord, who is the well-wisher of the entire universe and especially of His devotees, bewilders the discriminatory power of His own descendants in such a contradictory way that these seminal descendants become recognized as deviant and the actual qualification to be a representative of the Lord, namely unalloyed surrender to the will of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, remains prominent."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the reservoir of all beauty. All beautiful things emanate from Him, and His personal form is so attractive that it steals the eyes away from all other objects, which then seem devoid of beauty in comparison to Him. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was on the earth, He attracted the eyes of all people. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke, His words attracted the minds of all who remembered them. By seeing the footsteps of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, people became attracted to Him, and thus they wanted to offer their bodily activities to the Lord as His followers. In this way K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very easily spread His glories, which are sung throughout the world by the most sublime and essential Vedic verses. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered that simply by hearing and chanting those glories, conditioned souls born in the future would cross beyond the darkness of ignorance. Being satisfied with this arrangement, He left for His desired destination.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, these two verses indicate that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, having achieved all the purposes for which He had descended, went back to His spiritual kingdom. It is natural that people in the material world hanker to see a beautiful object. In materialistic life, however, our consciousness is polluted by the influence of the three modes of nature, and therefore we hanker for material objects of beauty and pleasure. The materialistic process of sense gratification is imperfect, because the laws of material nature will not allow us to be happy or satisfied in materialistic life. The living entity is constitutionally an eternal servant of God and is meant to appreciate the infinite beauty and pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Absolute Truth and the reservoir of all beauty and pleasure. By serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a we can also share in His ocean of beauty and pleasure, and thus our desire to see beautiful things and enjoy life will be fully satisfied. The example is given that the hand cannot enjoy food independently but can assimilate it indirectly by giving it to the stomach. Similarly, by serving Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the living entity, who is part and parcel of the Lord, will derive unlimited happiness. The inconceivable Supreme Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by displaying His own true form, freed the living entities from falsely seeking forms of beauty other than His form, which is itself the source of all beautiful things. Simply by seeing His lotus feet, fortunate living beings could distinguish between the ungodly endeavors of the karm\u012bs, who seek gross enjoyment for their own sense gratification, and the practice of dovetailing one\u2019s activities with the service of the Lord. Although philosophers perpetually speculate about the nature of God, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly liberated the j\u012bva souls from all speculative misunderstandings about Him by displaying His actual transcendental form and activities. Superficially, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal form, words and activities resemble those of ordinary conditioned souls. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that this apparent resemblance between the Lord\u2019s activities and those of the living entities is a merciful concession by the Lord so that the conditioned souls will be attracted to Him and become eligible to return to His kingdom for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. By showing His own spiritual form and kingdom to the living entities in a way tangible for them, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a drove away their false enjoying attitude and removed their long-standing indifference to His personality. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, if one can understand the position of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one will never again fall into the network of material illusion. Such a falldown can be avoided if one constantly hears about the unique transcendental form and beauty of the Lord from authorized Vedic literatures. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.42-43): \u201cMen of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.\u201d On the other hand, certain parts of Vedic literature are specifically meant to award material sense gratification to the conditioned soul and at the same time gradually condition him to obey the Vedic injunctions. The portions of the Vedas that recommend fruitive activities for regulated sense gratification are themselves dangerous, because the living being who engages in such activities becomes easily entangled in the material enjoyment offered and neglects the ultimate purpose of the Vedas. The ultimate purpose of Vedic literature is to bring the living entity back to his original consciousness, in which he acts as an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By rendering service to the Lord, the living entity can enjoy unlimited spiritual bliss in the association of the Lord in His own kingdom. Thus, one who seriously desires to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should specifically hear the Vedic literature that deals with pure devotional service to the Lord. One should hear from those who are highly advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and avoid interpretations that stimulate materialistic desires for enjoyment. When the tiny living entity is finally able to see the difference between the temporary affairs of this world and the transcendental activities of Lord Trivikrama, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he devotes himself to the Lord and removes from his heart the dark covering of matter, no longer desiring sense gratification, which is enjoyed under the two headings sin and piety. In other words, although people within this world are considered sinful or pious, on the material platform both sin and piety are performed for one\u2019s personal gratification. If one can understand that his real happiness lies in giving pleasure to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a takes such a fortunate living being back to His own abode, which is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. According to Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the Lord first gives a sincere soul the opportunity to hear about His pastimes. When the devotee has advanced in his spontaneous attraction to such narrations, the Lord gives him the opportunity to take part in His spiritual pastimes as they appear within this world. By taking part in the pastimes of the Lord within a particular universe, the living being becomes completely detached from the material world, and ultimately the Lord brings him to His personal abode in the spiritual sky. Foolish people cannot understand this substantial benefit offered by the Lord, but Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a acts for the benefit of such foolish people by saving them from their absorption in the temporary world of false enjoyment. The Lord does this by personally displaying His own superlative transcendental beauty, transcendental words and transcendental activities. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has pointed out that the words tamo\u00a0\u2019nay\u0101 tari\u1e63yanti indicate that although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared five thousand years ago, one who hears and chants about the activities, form and words of the Lord will get exactly the same benefit as those who personally experienced these things as contemporaries of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, he will also cross over the darkness of material existence and achieve the Lord\u2019s abode. Thus \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b concludes that if such an exalted destination is available to all living beings, it must certainly have been awarded to the Y\u0101davas, who were personal associates of the Lord. It is stated in this verse that by His beauty K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stole away the vision of people who saw Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s speaking was so attractive that those who heard Him became speechless. Since generally those who cannot speak are also deaf, the Lord\u2019s words also stole away the ears of those who heard Him, since they were no longer interested in hearing sounds other than the Lord\u2019s speaking. By displaying the beauty of His footsteps, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stole away from those who saw them the power to perform materialistic activities. Thus by His appearance in this world K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took away the senses of mankind. In other words, He made people blind, dumb, deaf, mad and otherwise invalid. Therefore Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura asks, \u201cSince He took away everything people possessed, who would properly call Him merciful? Rather, He is just a thief.\u201d In this way, he indirectly offers the highest praise to the beauty of the Lord. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also points out that although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave liberation to the demons by destroying them, to those who were attracted to Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave pure love of God and drowned them in the ocean of His own beauty. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not like a person who gives charity without discrimination. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so merciful that not only did He give the highest benediction to the inhabitants of the earth, but He empowered great saintly persons such as Vy\u0101sadeva to describe His pastimes with beautiful poetic verses. Thus people born on the earth in the future could easily cross over the ocean of birth and death by those glories, which are compared to a strong boat. In fact, those of us who are now enjoying the glories of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through the transparent medium of the Bhaktivedanta purports to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, by the mercy of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da, are the fortunate recipients of the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was merciful even to persons yet to be born. Quoting from the Amara-ko\u015ba dictionary, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b has also stated, pada\u1e41 vyavasita-tr\u0101\u1e47a-sth\u0101na-lak\u1e63my-a\u1e45ghri-vastu\u1e63u: the possible definitions for padam are \u201cthat which has been decided,\u201d \u201cplace of deliverance,\u201d \u201cfortune,\u201d \u201cfoot\u201d or \u201cobject.\u201d Thus he translates the word padam as also meaning vyavasita, \u201cthat which has been decided.\u201d In other words, the statement ag\u0101t sva\u1e41 padam \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 indicates not only that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to His abode, but that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a realized His determined desire. If we say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a returned to His eternal abode, we imply that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had been absent from His abode and was now returning. Therefore, Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura points out that it is incorrect to say in a normal sense that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u201cwent back to His abode.\u201d According to the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is always present in His eternal abode in the spiritual sky. Yet by His causeless mercy He also manifests Himself from time to time within the material world. In other words, God is all-pervading. Even when present before us He is simultaneously in His abode. The ordinary soul, or j\u012bva, is not all-pervading like the Supersoul, and therefore by his presence in the material world he is absent from the spiritual world. In fact, we are suffering due to that absence from the spiritual world, or Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is all-pervading, and therefore Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura translates the words ag\u0101t sva\u1e41 padam to mean that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a achieved exactly what He desired. The Lord is all-pervading and self-sufficient in fulfilling His perfect desires. His appearance and disappearance in this world should never be compared to ordinary material activities. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b has quoted a statement by Uddhava at the beginning of the Third Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.2.7) wherein Uddhava compares the disappearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to the setting of the sun. In his purport to this verse, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has written: \u201cThe comparison of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to the sun is very appropriate. As soon as the sun sets, darkness automatically appears. But the darkness experienced by the common man does not affect the sun itself either at the time of sunrise or at sunset. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance and disappearance are exactly like that of the sun. He appears and disappears in innumerable universes, and as long as He is present in a particular universe there is all transcendental light in that universe, but the universe from which He passes away is put into darkness. His pastimes, however, are everlasting. The Lord is always present in some universe, just as the sun is present in either the Eastern or Western Hemisphere. The sun is always present either in India or America, but when the sun is present in India the American land is in darkness, and when the sun is present in America the Indian hemisphere is in darkness.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has quoted a verse from the end of the Eleventh Canto that further clarifies that the abode of the Lord is as eternal as the Lord Himself: \u201cThe ocean immediately swallowed Dv\u0101rak\u0101, O Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, taking away the Lord\u2019s personal abode, which the Lord had abandoned. The Supreme Lord, Madhus\u016bdana, is always present in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, which merely by being remembered takes away everything unfavorable. It is the most auspicious of auspicious places.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.31.23-24) Just as the sun appears to be swallowed by the night, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His abode or His dynasty seems to disappear, but actually the Lord and all of His paraphernalia, including His abode and dynasty, are eternal, in the same way as the sun is always in the sky. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da says in this connection, \u201cAs the sun appears in the morning and gradually rises to the meridian and then again sets in one hemisphere while simultaneously rising in the other, so Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s disappearance in one universe and the beginning of His different pastimes in another take place simultaneously. As soon as one pastime is finished here, it is manifested in another universe. And thus His nitya-l\u012bl\u0101, or eternal pastimes, are going on without ending.\u201d"

Further, even if the br\u0101hma\u1e47as became angry, why would they curse members of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s own family? Since the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were well learned, they must have known that it is offensive to oppose personal associates of the Supreme Lord. The Yadu dynasty is specifically described here as v\u1e5b\u1e63n\u012bn\u0101m and k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-cetas\u0101m. In other words, they were Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s own men, and they were always absorbed in thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, even if somehow or other the br\u0101hma\u1e47as had cursed them, how could that curse have had any effect? These are the questions of Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Although the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is are described in this verse as k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-cetas\u0101m, always absorbed in thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is clearly indicated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desired that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as become angry and curse the Yadu dynasty. The Supreme Lord desired to remove His personal dynasty from the earth, and therefore uncustomary offensive behavior was exhibited by the young boys of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s own family. It is to be understood from this incident that when a man displays envy and ridicule of devotees of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, his brahma\u1e47yat\u0101, or high spiritual qualifications, along with his reverence for \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are all destroyed. Contempt and ridicule directed toward respectable persons and true br\u0101hma\u1e47as vanquish all good qualities. If there is a break in etiquette toward His devotees, the Supreme Lord will become ill-disposed even to His own relatives and friends and thus arrange to destroy those who oppose His devotees. If foolish persons in the guise of members of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal family express enmity toward Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, such offenders cannot properly be called offspring of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s dynasty. That is the supreme equality of the Personality of Godhead."

Residing in His abode and enjoying life, the Lord, whose glorification is in itself magnanimous, now wanted to annihilate His dynasty, as there still remained some small part of His duty to be carried out.",
        "purport": " This verse answers Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s question as to how the powerful members of the Yadu dynasty could be cursed by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and thus destroy themselves in a fratricidal war. By the words sa\u1e41hartum aicchata kulam it is clearly stated that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself desired to withdraw His dynasty and therefore engaged the br\u0101hma\u1e47as as His agent. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks here that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had clearly demonstrated the insurpassable beauty and strength of His personal form, pastimes and pleasures to all the residents of the earth. Thus His incarnation to kill the demons, save the devotees and reestablish religious principles had been completely successful. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a noticed that His mission was now complete, everything having been done perfectly, He desired to return to His transcendental abode, along with the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is. Thus the Lord personally arranged for the Yadu dynasty to be cursed by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. According to Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, \u0101pta-k\u0101ma\u1e25 means that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always self-satisfied, and yet in order to execute His transcendental pastimes He arranged to destroy His own dynasty for three specific purposes, namely, to reestablish in the heavenly planets those demigods who had taken birth among the Yadus to assist Him, to reestablish His plenary Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions in Their abodes, such as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, \u015avetadv\u012bpa and Badarik\u0101\u015brama, and to remove Himself from the vision of the material world, along with His eternal associates. In this connection, Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b has made several important remarks about the destruction of the Yadu dynasty. He states that many so-called religious persons have fallen down by committing the second offense against chanting the holy name, namely vi\u1e63\u1e47au sarve\u015bvare\u015be tad-itara-sama-dh\u012b\u1e25, considering another living entity to be equal to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is the Lord of lords. One who is captured by the impersonal tendency of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy falsely thinks that the external, material energy of the Lord is equal to His internal, spiritual potency. In this way, one equates ordinary living entities with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, taking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be another aspect of m\u0101y\u0101. This is a most unfortunate misconception, for it spoils one\u2019s opportunity to understand God as He actually is. Persons inclined toward this illusory conception of life would undoubtedly consider the members of the Yadu dynasty equal in all respects to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and worship the future descendants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s family as being equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Thus the continued presence of the Yadu dynasty on the earth would certainly constitute a great impediment on the path of spiritual understanding and a great burden on the earth. To counteract the danger to the world from the offense of equating Vi\u1e63\u1e47u with the family of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Lord decided to crush the Yadu family. The Supreme Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is always affectionate to His devotees, but whenever the familial descendants of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a become inimical or indifferent to Him, not loving His pure devotees or making friendship with His servants, such so-called family members of the Lord become impediments to His will. There is a tangible danger that ignorant living beings will worship such inimical persons, revering them as close associates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. For example, to consider Ka\u1e41sa the maternal uncle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and therefore a faithful servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would be a completely erroneous conclusion. By such a misconception, evil men who oppose the Lord may be accepted as His intimate associates, and persons inimical to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may be thought of as His surrendered dependents appearing in His own family. The purpose of the destruction of the Yadu dynasty was to eradicate the false logic of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs who desire to see everything as one in all respects and who therefore improperly reason that the enemies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees can be His intimate family members."

On the other hand, activities such as caring for one\u2019s children give immediate pleasure in the present only, whereas rituals performed as atonement take away sinful reactions. But the religious activities mentioned in verse 11, which are indicated by the words karm\u0101\u1e47i pu\u1e47ya-nivah\u0101ni su-ma\u1e45gal\u0101ni g\u0101yaj-jagat-kali-mal\u0101pahar\u0101\u1e47i, were pious in all respects. They produced abundant pious results and great joy and were so potent that merely glorifying these rituals relieves one from all the sinful reactions of Kali-yuga. The sages called to Vasudeva\u2019s house to perform such auspicious religious activities were satisfied with proper gifts and then sent by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Pi\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101raka, a nearby holy place situated about two miles from the Arabian Sea on the coast of Gujarat. Its current name is still Pi\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101raka. Significantly, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is mentioned here as k\u0101l\u0101tman\u0101, the form of time, or the Supersoul. In the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Supreme Personality of Godhead reveals Himself to Arjuna as time personified, appearing on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra to destroy all the kings and armies who constitute a burden to the earth. Similarly, k\u0101l\u0101tman\u0101 nivasat\u0101 yadu-deva-gehe: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was staying in the home of His father Vasudeva as time personified, thus indicating that the time was approaching for the destruction of His own dynasty according to His desire."

Playfully approaching the great sages gathered there, the boys grabbed hold of the sages\u2019 feet and impudently asked them with feigned humility, \u201cO learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as, this black-eyed pregnant woman has something to ask you. She is too embarrassed to inquire for herself. She is just about to give birth and is very desirous of having a son. Since all of you are great sages with infallible vision, please tell us whether her child will be a boy or a girl.\u201d",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b has made the following comment: \u201cThe impudent behavior of the young Yadus toward the sages headed by N\u0101rada, who were all br\u0101hma\u1e47as and devotees of the Lord, was a display of deviation from the path of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, although the pr\u0101k\u1e5bta-sahajiy\u0101s think of themselves as intimate associates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supremely merciful Lord\u2019s determination is perfectly correct in working to finish such false devotees. Such impostors actually never accept real service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The yadu-kum\u0101ras\u2019 deception is termed \u2018seemingly humble,\u2019 meaning that in fact they were anything but humble. Therefore, the ridiculing of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas by the Lord\u2019s family resulted in a great offense against the devotees of the Lord.\u201d A similar incident occurred during the pastimes of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu when His own mother offended \u015ar\u012b Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu personally rectified this offense against a great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, and thus the Lord showed His magnanimity. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastime of destroying the Yadu dynasty is also a demonstration of His mercy to His devotees. Believing the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and \u1e5b\u1e63is to be foolishly lacking knowledge in material affairs of sense gratification, the yadu-kum\u0101ras dressed S\u0101mba, the son of J\u0101mbavat\u012b, as a woman and tried to mock the saintly assembly. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to teach that such an offense committed against great devotees by His associate S\u0101mba would be the cause of the Yadu dynasty\u2019s destruction, all as part of His l\u012bl\u0101. In modern times such misbehavior has also manifested itself within the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava community. Unauthorized persons have initiated the process of deceitfully bestowing a woman\u2019s dress on their followers. This process is to be counted as a variety of apar\u0101dha, or offense against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such an attempt to cheapen and ridicule devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is certainly caused by envy toward the real Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, who are faithfully engaged in devotional service according to the rules and regulations of the Vedic literature. Thus R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has said: \u201cIf one wants to demonstrate his great devotion to the Supreme Lord but his process of devotional service violates the standard rules of revealed scriptures such as \u015bruti, sm\u1e5bti, Pur\u0101\u1e47as and N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, then his alleged love of Godhead will simply disturb society by misleading people from the auspicious path of spiritual advancement.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.101) The taking of a woman\u2019s clothing by a man in k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-l\u012bl\u0101 was intended to point out this fact. Such an act amounts to cheating and ridicule of the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. S\u0101mba is a personal associate of the Lord, but acting as a harbinger of the future misfortune to be created in Kali-yuga by bogus followers of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, S\u0101mba displayed this didactic pastime to help the living entities be blessed on the correct path of devotional service. The boys said to the sages, \u201cO \u1e5b\u1e63is, O br\u0101hma\u1e47as, O N\u0101rada and other great personalities, can you tell us whether it will be a son or a daughter that will be born from this pregnant woman\u2019s womb?\u201d By addressing pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas in this way, they anticipated the fraudulent samprad\u0101yas of the modern age in their practice of sakh\u012b-bheka, or dressing men as female associates of the gop\u012bs. This unauthorized activity constitutes contempt and mockery of the pure devotees of the Lord. Many false yog\u012bs, imagining they are distributing first-class devotion on the liberated platform, attempt to award the status of \u201cpure devotee\u201d to candidates totally ignorant of the transcendental tastes of madhura-rati, or the Lord\u2019s conjugal love in the spiritual world. Even though they know that the general populace is unfit to imitate the liberated associates of the Lord, they artificially decorate ordinary persons with the ornaments of spiritual perfection, such as tears, a melted heart, and the standing on end of the bodily hairs. Thus these bogus yog\u012bs introduce a process that misleads the world. Because \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu understood that the great misfortune caused by such false yog\u012bs, or kuyog\u012bs, was impossible to forestall in the Kali-yuga, He infected them with insane desires for material objects of lust so that ordinary persons can easily identify such false yog\u012bs as deviated from the path of pure devotional service. The mockery of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas by the young boys of the Yadu dynasty who dressed S\u0101mba in woman\u2019s garb, and the resultant destruction of the Yadu dynasty, conclusively demonstrate the uselessness of the sahajiy\u0101samprad\u0101yas. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has confirmed that the lack of humility shown by the sons of the Yadu dynasty was an arrangement by the Lord Himself. In other words, the members of the Yadu dynasty are ultimately associates of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and to facilitate the instructive pastimes of the Lord they acted in apparently unethical ways."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, arranged for the young members of His own family, the Yadu dynasty, to exhibit the dangerous lower propensities of mankind. Thus the Y\u0101dava boys imitated the activities of the followers of a pseudodevotional cult. Just before His disappearance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desired that the sages become angry at the young members of the Yadu dynasty, in order to teach that Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas cannot be thought of as foolish, ignorant or mundane and to reduce the false pride of His own family members. Sometimes misguided persons assume the roles of pseudodevotees and blaspheme the actual process of pure devotional service and the pure devotees who are surrendered to preaching the mission of the Lord. Such foolish pseudodevotees think that their hatred or envy of the actual preaching mission of the Lord constitutes bhakti, but in fact it constitutes the cause of all trouble both for them and for the unfortunate people who follow them. The preachers of pure devotional service expose the pernicious attempts of pseudodevotees, and similarly the sages headed by N\u0101rada, who were all exalted devotees of the Lord, addressed the young boys of the Yadu dynasty as bewildered fools and told them, \u201cWithin this false womb or false dress of a s\u0101dhu, a club will take birth that will be the source of your dynasty\u2019s destruction.\u201d Especially in India, but now also in the Western countries, there is a class of polluted sense enjoyers who also call themselves Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and pretend to exhibit the highest state of prema-bhakti. They declare that they are on the highest stage of devotion and therefore concerned only with the most intimate affairs of m\u0101dhurya-l\u012bl\u0101, as exhibited in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Sometimes they even dress as gop\u012bs, making a false show of entering into the pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without actually following the standard regulations. In the name of prema-bhakti, they sometimes commit grievous offenses against the pure devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By this incident concerning the iron club from the so-called womb of S\u0101mba, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself taught the dangerous results of such pseudodevotion."

This example shows that in a polluted society the club of duplicity can never bring the peace found in the society of devotees. Rather, such duplicity smashes all the nondevotional activities and whimsical doctrines of the pseudodevotees. The Yadu boys were wary about jeopardizing their advanced position and indeed had been thinking that as long as they kept their trickery concealed, others would never be able to detect such sophisticated cheating. Nonetheless, they were unable to protect their family from the reaction of their grievous offense against the devotees of the Lord."

It is also mentioned, k\u0101la-r\u016bp\u012b: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gladly gave His sanction to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 curse in the form of time. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Prabhup\u0101da has commented that the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47acandra, decided to maintain the curse intact in order to protect the actual principles of religion and destroy the unbecoming offense of the deceitful members of the K\u0101r\u1e63\u1e47a dynasty. It is clearly explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the whole purpose of the Lord\u2019s descent into the material world is to reestablish the authentic principles of religion by which the conditioned souls who are suffering intensely under the laws of material nature can regain their original existential status as eternally liberated servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The living entity comes to this material world with a desire to lord it over material nature, although the living entity is in fact not a lord but an eternal servant. Due to this perverted tendency to exploit the entire world for his sense gratification, the living entity is also prone to try to pervert the principles of spiritual life so that the eternal religious principles become appropriate to his own material sense gratification. Religion, however, is meant for pleasing the Supreme Lord by obeying His laws. And therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself personally comes from time to time to revive and enliven the correct method of devotional service to His lotus feet. In the Eleventh Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is clearly stated that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had completed the vast majority of His pastimes on the earth and was now making the final arrangements for His departure. Therefore, He wished to leave behind a vivid lesson for the living entities of this age that any so-called religious person, even if he is so exalted as to take birth in the Lord\u2019s personal family, cannot violate the respect and reverence which is due to the pure devotees of the Lord, such as N\u0101rada Muni. The principle of serving the pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so essential for spiritual advancement that the Lord exhibited the inconceivable pastime of causing the destruction of His entire dynasty just to impress this point upon the conditioned souls of Kali-yuga. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam hints at the great misfortunes that would come after the disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such misfortunes also occurred after the disappearance of Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who is accepted by Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Through various instructions, the Bh\u0101gavatam provides for eliminating the cheating pseudoreligion that comes forth in human society after the departure of the Lord. Lord Caitanya, exhibiting His magnanimous pastimes, drove away from South India all the false doctrines of the apasamprad\u0101yas, or so-called disciplic traditions of pseudodevotees, who had gained great influence by resorting to the atheistic theories of the Buddhists and Jains. Thus He turned all of India toward the devotional service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, so that due to the extensive preaching of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and His followers there remained no topic of discussion in the world other than devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Trida\u1e47\u1e0dip\u0101da Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b has elaborated on this in his verse str\u012b-putr\u0101di-kath\u0101\u1e41 jahur vi\u1e63ayi\u1e47a\u1e25. \u015ar\u012b Narahari Sarak\u0101ra \u1e6ch\u0101kura, in his book K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-bhajan\u0101m\u1e5bta, has corrected the improper statements of the gaur\u0101\u1e45ga-n\u0101gar\u012b-v\u0101d\u012bs, sakh\u012bbheka-v\u0101d\u012bs, and others of the eleven pseudodisciplic chains that claim to follow \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. These unauthorized persons present cheating in the guise of religion and advertise their duplicity as kath\u0101, or pure worship of the Lord. Just as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a brought about a furious quarrel to destroy His own family, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu arranged for the world to be flooded by varieties of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da and karma-v\u0101da philosophies just after His disappearance. He did this to destroy persons who belonged to the eleven apasamprad\u0101yas, or unauthorized disciplic traditions, as well as the many other apasamprad\u0101yas that would appear in the future and presume to call themselves devotees of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu or pretend to be descendants in His family line. At the same time, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu arranged for His own men to be kept away from the pseudodevotion of these cheaters. The devotees of Lord Gaurasundara, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, can discern the mysteries of His pastimes that manifest in the pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The activities of the transcendental body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be understood in any ordinary mundane way. That is the essential meaning of this chapter."
