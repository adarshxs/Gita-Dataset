        "translation": "When many people live together in one place there will undoubtedly be quarreling. And even if only two people live together there will be frivolous conversation and disagreement. Therefore, to avoid conflict, one should live alone, as we learn from the example of the bracelet of the young girl.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has given a nice example in this regard. Because the young girl mentioned in this story had no husband, she had to fulfill her duties as a host by removing her bracelets so that each wrist held one bracelet only. In the same way, the process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, or spiritual advancement by philosophical speculation, demands that the speculating sages live alone, without any other association. Since j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs have dedicated their lives to speculation, there will undoubtedly be endless argument and quarreling on technical points if many j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs live together. Therefore, to keep a peaceful atmosphere they must live alone. On the other hand, a king\u2019s daughter who has been duly married to an aristocratic prince fulfills her duties to her husband by dressing herself attractively with innumerable ornaments and approaching him for love. Similarly, the goddess of devotion, Bhaktidev\u012b, decorates herself with the innumerable ornaments of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, who come together to relish the sweet sound of the holy name of the Lord. Because pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas do not intimately associate with nondevotees, it may be said that they reside alone, and thus they also fulfill the purpose of this verse. There cannot be any quarrel among pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, because they are on the real platform of desirelessness, not wanting even salvation or mystic powers, what to speak of sense gratification. Because they are all devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they may freely associate with one another for glorifying the Lord. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.25.34): \u201cA pure devotee, who is attached to the activities of devotional service and who always engages in the service of My lotus feet, never desires to become one with Me. Such a devotee, who is unflinchingly engaged, always glorifies My pastimes and activities.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has commented on this verse as follows: \u201cThe young girl in the story kept only one bracelet on each wrist so that there would be no noisy conflict among the bracelets. Similarly, one should give up the association of those who are not devoted to the Supreme Lord.\u201d This is the actual lesson to be learned. A real Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always pure and faultless in character. However, in those places where nondevotees congregate there will undoubtedly be envious criticism of the devotional service of the Lord, and those who falsely attempt to analyze reality without the Supreme Personality of Godhead will create much disturbing noise in the name of philosophy. Therefore, one should remain in those places where the Supreme Lord is properly worshiped according to the Vedic standard. If everyone is dedicated to glorifying the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there will not be any impediment in mutual association. However, in a place where people have many different purposes besides the pleasure of the Supreme Lord, social dealings will certainly be disrupted. One should therefore avoid the association of those who are inimical to devotional service; otherwise one will be frustrated in achieving the spiritual purpose of life. One who always keeps himself in the company of the devotees of the Lord is actually living alone. If one lives in a community where the only consideration is the pleasure of the Lord, then one can avoid the contradictory situations caused by many persons competing to satisfy their own material desires. This is the lesson intelligently understood by the br\u0101hma\u1e47a from the bracelets of the young girl. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya quotes the following: \u201cOne should not under any circumstances live with those who are not devotees of the Lord. On the other hand, one should stay with many devotees, because such association awards liberation.\u201d"

        "purport": " One should develop vair\u0101gya, or detachment, by observing that all material things are doomed. Thus one should take to the regulated practice of yoga, which in this age means the process of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the avadh\u016bta br\u0101hma\u1e47a is recommending bhakti-mi\u015bra a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, or the eightfold mystic yoga process performed as an offering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The desire to enjoy the material world is so strong that the mind wanders here and there uncontrollably. Therefore it is stated, dhriyam\u0101\u1e47am: the mind must be fixed in the goal of life, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the perfect stage of mental concentration called sam\u0101dhi there is no longer any distinction between internal and external vision, since one can see the Absolute Truth everywhere. In the mystic yoga process one must sit properly, and then it is possible to control the different airs within the body. When the breathing process is controlled, the mind, which is dependent upon the actions of the bodily airs, is easily fixed in higher consciousness. But although the mind may be momentarily controlled, if one is overcome by desire for sense gratification the mind will again be lost. Thus, this verse emphasizes vair\u0101gya, detachment from material illusion. This is attained by abhy\u0101sa-yoga, the regulated practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is the highest yoga system, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.47): \u201cAnd of all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\u201d"

If one can free oneself from the influence of the material modes of passion and ignorance, then life becomes very auspicious.

        "translation": "Thus, when one\u2019s consciousness is completely fixed on the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one no longer sees duality, or internal and external reality. The example is given of the arrow maker who was so absorbed in making a straight arrow that he did not even see or notice the king himself, who was passing right next to him.",
        "purport": " It is understood that when a king moves on a public street he is heralded by kettledrums and other musical instruments and is accompanied by soldiers and other members of his retinue. Thus, despite this royal extravaganza passing right by his workshop, the arrow maker did not even notice because he was completely absorbed in his prescribed duty of making an arrow straight and sharp. One who is completely absorbed in loving devotional service to the Absolute Truth, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, no longer pays attention to material illusion. In this verse the word bahis, \u201cexternal,\u201d refers to the innumerable objects of material sense gratification, such as food, drink, sex, and so on, which drag the senses of the conditioned soul into material duality. The word antaram, or \u201cinternal,\u201d refers to memory of previous sense gratification or hopes and dreams for future materialistic situations. One who is seeing everywhere the Absolute Truth, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, categorically rejects both internal and external illusion. This is called mukti-pada, or the status of liberation. On this platform there is neither attraction nor aversion to sense objects; rather, there is loving absorption in the Absolute Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and an overwhelming desire to please Him by devotional service. One who gives up the reality of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be forced to wander uselessly in the kingdom of mental speculation. One who cannot see that the Absolute Truth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the background and basis of everything that exists will be bewildered by the false concept that there is something that is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Everything emanates from the Lord, and He is the Lord of everything. This simple understanding is the actual existential situation."

        "purport": " The previous narration concerning the shell bracelets of the young girl demonstrates that even saintly persons engaged in ordinary yoga processes should remain alone to avoid conflict or disturbance. In other words, persons engaged in ordinary yoga processes should not even associate with each other. This verse indirectly refers to the serpent, who, fearing attack from human beings, keeps himself secluded. From this example we learn that a saintly person should not associate with ordinary materialistic people. He should also avoid having a fixed residence and should wander unnoticed by others. Our engagement in material existence is the cause of our unhappiness. Such engagement destroys the real purpose of our life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Somehow or other one must give up the deep-rooted attachment to material society, friendship and love. One must practice detachment, and by surrender to the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one\u2019s auspicious life will begin. By organizing one\u2019s life according to the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system one can take the first step in self-realization. In other words, one should accept an honest occupation and regulate his sex life, either by giving it up entirely as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b or sanny\u0101s\u012b or by living as a married householder. Without regulating one\u2019s occupation and personal life, there will be chaos, and it will be very difficult to make spiritual advancement. The attachments to material society, friendship and love are based on a long previous experience in the material world. They are great obstacles in the path of transcendental understanding, and if one maintains them, spiritual progress will be most difficult. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu taught by His example and precept what a devotee should and should not do, and obedience to such principles brings one to the path of supreme perfection. Thus, one has to rise above ordinary social custom, which directs the living entity toward useless sense gratification."

Thus he does not entangle himself in the labor of home building. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura points out that although materialistic persons take unlimited pains to invent and mass-produce electricity, automobiles, airplanes, etc., ultimately these things are meant for the convenience of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas who are preaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The karm\u012bs will always go to such trouble, and the devotees will always offer such laborious productions to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by engaging them in His loving service. The devotees, being concerned with the ultimate perfection of life, do not personally struggle for material advancement. On the other hand, there is no need for the devotees to artificially imitate the austere lifestyle of ancient times. A devotee\u2019s goal is simply to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as nicely as possible; therefore the devotees willingly accept beautiful mansions and all types of material opulences, not with any personal attachment, but only so that these things can be engaged in the loving service of the Lord. If one engages such things with a desire to enjoy them, one falls down from the platform of pure devotional service. Materialistic persons are only interested in exploiting their so-called yoga practice in order to rejuvenate their sexual potency or to vainly remember their previous conditioned lives. Thus, applying mysticism to the endless search for sense gratification, they do not understand the actual goal of human life."

Less intelligent persons accept the illogical doctrine that the Lord is transformed into His creation and maintains no separate, individual existence. They falsely imagine that they can merge their individuality into the universal oneness and become exactly equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, in the opinion of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam the Personality of Godhead is not impersonal but is instead full of all transcendental qualities. The three modes of material nature constitute His inferior energy, and the omnipotent time factor, upon which the modes rest, is the personal expansion of the Lord. Thus, the Lord creates, maintains and annihilates the material manifestation and yet remains completely apart from it. The conditioned souls who desire to exploit the Lord\u2019s inferior creation are impelled by the Personality of Godhead to do so, and thus they become imitation enjoyers in the temporary world of matter. But when one gains practical experience that the gross and subtle material bodies are simply coverings of the eternal soul, one gives up the foolishness of material attachment and becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He realizes that his constitutional position is neither to enjoy matter nor merge into the Lord\u2019s existence. His real nature is that he is a servant of God. Service rendered to the Lord is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, and by the potency of such service one becomes liberated and his activities become glorious. Such service is eternal and gradually promotes one to the platform of keval\u0101nubhav\u0101nanda-sandoha, or merging into the ocean of bliss by seeing the transcendental personal form of the Lord."

        "purport": " The word kevala means \u201cpure\u201d and indicates that the Lord\u2019s k\u0101la\u015bakti, or time potency, is a transcendental energy nondifferent from His personal body. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a addresses King Yadu here as arindama, subduer of the enemies. This indicates that although the topic of m\u0101y\u0101, or illusory creation, is being discussed, the King need not worry, because as a staunch devotee of the Lord, he is able to subdue the real enemies of life, namely lust, anger and greed, which make one a prisoner in m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s kingdom. The word s\u016btram indicates the mahat-tattva, on which many material creations rest, just like jewels rest on a thread. In the state of pradh\u0101na, or material equilibrium, the modes of nature do not interact. In the Third Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Lord Kapila explains in His S\u0101\u1e45khya teachings that the Supreme Personality of Godhead agitates the neutral state of nature and thus creation takes place. The created manifest form of nature in which fruitive activities are stimulated is called mahat-tattva, as indicated in this verse. If one tries to renounce the illusory creation of the Lord by taking shelter of impersonal Ved\u0101nta philosophy, thus artificially equating the infinite consciousness of the Lord and the infinitesimal consciousness of the conditioned soul, one\u2019s analysis will fall far short of reality. The word sva-m\u0101y\u0101m in this verse indicates that the illusory potency that covers the conditioned souls is always subordinate to the Lord, whose consciousness is infallible and infinite and who is always a person."

Due to extreme fear the smaller insect was absorbed in the characteristics and activities of the large wasp and thus entered into the existence of the wasp. Due to such meditation, he actually took the body of a wasp in his next life. Similarly, although we are conditioned souls, if we absorb our consciousness in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a we can become liberated even before giving up our present body. If our intelligence becomes steady on the spiritual platform by understanding that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everything, then we can give up unnecessary consciousness of the external body and absorb ourselves in the spiritual pastimes of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha.

He does all this for the gratification of his own body. As a tree before dying produces the seed of a future tree, the dying body manifests the seed of one\u2019s next material body in the form of one\u2019s accumulated karma. Thus assuring the continuation of material existence, the material body sinks down and dies.",
        "purport": " One might argue, \u201cAmong all the gurus mentioned thus far, the material body is certainly the best, since it awards the detachment and fine intelligence that enable one to engage in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus, we should serve the body, although it is temporary, with great attachment, or risk the offense of ungratefulness. How can detachment from the body be recommended when the body is endowed with so many wonderful qualities?\u201d The answer is given in this verse. The body does not award detachment and knowledge in the manner of some benevolent teacher; rather, it causes so much pain and misery that any commonsense person cannot help being convinced of the uselessness of material life. Just as a tree produces the seeds of the next tree and then dies, the body\u2019s lusty desires induce the conditioned soul to create a further chain of karma. Finally the body, having paved the way for unlimited suffering in material existence, drops dead. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, deha indicates both the gross body and the subtle, mental body. Those who do not clearly understand the difference between body and soul falsely think that body and soul are identical and that one can find perfect happiness in bodily sense gratification. But those who foolishly accept the temporary body as all-important cannot be compared with self-realized souls who intelligently understand the superiority of the eternal soul."

If one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the Supreme Lord personally feels happiness and gradually reveals Himself to His devotee. The Lord\u2019s material creation consists of the living entities and dead matter, which the less intelligent try to enjoy. The Lord, however, is not satisfied by those species that blindly strive for sense gratification without understanding spiritual nature. We are suffering due to our forgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the blissful situation of His abode. If we accept the Lord as protector and shelter and execute His order, we can easily revive our eternal, blissful nature as parts and parcels of the Personality of Godhead. It is for this purpose that the Lord has created human life."

Even ordinary houseflies have a busy sex life and thus multiply rapidly. Human life, however, enables one to understand the Absolute Truth and is therefore full of grave responsibility. Since the valuable human life is not eternal, we should do the needful to achieve the highest perfection, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Before death appears, we should seriously cultivate our real self-interest. One can experience K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the association of devotees of the Lord. Without their association, one is in danger of being attracted to an impersonal conception of life, which causes one to fall away from devotional service to the Absolute Truth. Or, being discouraged by one\u2019s failure to understand the Absolute Truth, one may return to the false platform of sense gratification. In conclusion, human life is meant for cultivating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the guidance of the experienced, self-realized devotees of the Lord."

        "translation": "Although the Absolute Truth is one without a second, the sages have described Him in many different ways. Therefore one may not be able to acquire very firm or complete knowledge from one spiritual master.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b comments on this verse as follows. \u201cThe statement that one requires many spiritual masters certainly needs explanation, since practically all great saintly persons of the past did not take shelter of many spiritual masters, but rather accepted one. The words g\u012byate bahudhar\u1e63ibhi\u1e25, \u2018the Absolute Truth is glorified in many ways by the sages,\u2019 indicate the personal and impersonal understandings of the Absolute Truth. In other words, some sages describe only the Lord\u2019s impersonal effulgence, which is without spiritual variety, whereas others describe the Lord\u2019s manifest form as the Personality of Godhead. Thus, merely by hearing from many different authorities, one cannot actually learn the highest perfection of life. The proliferation of differing spiritual authorities is useful only to counteract the living entities\u2019 tendency to be grossly materialistic. Different spiritual philosophers create faith in the existence of the soul and may be accepted at that level. But as will be clarified in later verses, the spiritual master who ultimately gives perfect knowledge is one.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b comments as follows on this verse. \u201cSince it is commonly understood that one is to accept a single spiritual master, why is it recommended that one learn from many so-called spiritual masters appearing in the forms of ordinary material objects? The explanation is that one\u2019s worshipable spiritual master will instruct one in many departments of knowledge by giving lessons gleaned from ordinary objects. As recommended by the br\u0101hma\u1e47a avadh\u016bta, one can strengthen the teachings received from one\u2019s \u0101c\u0101rya and avoid transgressing his orders by observing ordinary things in nature. One should not mechanically receive the teachings of one\u2019s guru. The disciple should be thoughtful and with his own intelligence realize in practice what he has heard from his spiritual master by observing the world around him. In this sense one may accept many gurus, though not those who preach against the knowledge received from the bona fide spiritual master. In other words, one should not hear from persons like the atheist Kapila.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also comments on this verse, as follows. \u201cIt is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, tasm\u0101d guru\u1e41 prapadyeta jij\u00f1\u0101su\u1e25 \u015breya uttamam: \u2018Therefore one should approach a bona fide spiritual master if one actually desires to achieve the highest perfection in life.\u2019 Similarly, in Chapter Ten, verse 5 of this canto, the Personality of Godhead Himself states, mad-abhij\u00f1a\u1e41 guru\u1e41 \u015b\u0101ntam up\u0101s\u012bta mad-\u0101tmakam: \u2018One must serve a bona fide spiritual master who is in full knowledge of My personality and who is not different from Me.\u2019 There are many similar verses in Vedic literature indicating that one must take shelter of a single bona fide spiritual master. We also have the examples of innumerable great saintly persons who did not accept more than one spiritual master. Thus, it is a fact that we should accept one bona fide spiritual master and receive from him the particular mantra that one is to chant. I myself certainly follow this principle and worship my bona fide spiritual master. However, in worshiping one\u2019s \u0101c\u0101rya, one may take help from good and bad examples. By observing examples of good behavior one will be strengthened in devotional service, and in seeing negative examples one will be forewarned and avoid danger. In this way, one may accept many ordinary material objects as one\u2019s spiritual masters, considering them as \u015bik\u1e63\u0101-gurus, or gurus who give important lessons for spiritual advancement.\u201d Thus in the Lord\u2019s own words, mad-abhij\u00f1a\u1e41 guru\u1e41 \u015b\u0101ntam up\u0101s\u012bta mad-\u0101tmakam: one should approach a single bona fide spiritual master who is in full knowledge of the Lord\u2019s personality and sincerely worship him, considering him to be mad-\u0101tmakam, or nondifferent from the Lord Himself. This statement does not contradict what the Lord has presented in the teachings of the avadh\u016bta br\u0101hma\u1e47a. If one receives the teachings of one\u2019s \u0101c\u0101rya but keeps them locked up in his brain as theoretical dogma, one will make little advancement. To develop steady, complete knowledge one must see the teachings of one\u2019s \u0101c\u0101rya everywhere; thus a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava offers all respects to anyone or anything that gives him further enlightenment in the path of worshiping his bona fide \u0101c\u0101rya, who is nondifferent from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Among the many gurus mentioned by the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, some give positive instructions and others give negative instructions. Pi\u1e45gal\u0101 the prostitute and the young girl who took off her bracelets provide examples of proper conduct, whereas the hapless pigeons and the foolish honeybee provide examples of behavior to be avoided. In both cases one\u2019s spiritual knowledge is enriched. Thus, one should not misunderstand the meaning of this verse in a way contradictory to the Lord\u2019s statement mad-abhij\u00f1a\u1e41 guru\u1e41 \u015b\u0101ntam up\u0101s\u012bta mad-\u0101tmakam (Bh\u0101g. 11.10.5)."

King Yadu was enlightened by Datt\u0101treya in the form of an avadh\u016bta br\u0101hma\u1e47a who taught the King to fix his consciousness on the spiritual platform of detachment by simply observing the creation of God."
