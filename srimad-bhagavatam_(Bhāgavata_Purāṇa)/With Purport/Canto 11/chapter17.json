My dear lotus-eyed Lord, now please explain to me how all human beings can achieve loving service unto You by the execution of their prescribed duties.",
        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has already elaborately explained the process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, bhakti-yoga and a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga. Now Uddhava inquires how those inclined toward karma-yoga can achieve the perfection of life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a describes that He is personally the creator of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system. C\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25. Therefore the ultimate goal of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system is to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, one should become a devotee of the Lord and learn the process of pure devotional service. The easiest method of achieving pure devotional service is by the association of pure devotees of the Lord. If one submissively and faithfully associates with pure devotees, one can immediately achieve the perfection of life. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is not required to execute all the formalities of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, because a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, absorbed in love of Godhead, automatically gives up all sense gratification and mental speculation. Those human beings who do not follow the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system are here referred to as dvi-pad\u0101m, or two-legged. In other words, one who does not follow the religious path of life is known to be human only by the possession of two legs. Even ordinary animals and insects are eagerly engaged in eating, sleeping, mating and defending; the human being, however, is distinguished from such lower forms of life by his capacity to become religious and, ultimately, to love God in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " It is understood from this verse that the supreme religious principle is unalloyed surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Satya-yuga there is no influence of the lower modes of nature, and therefore all human beings belong to the highest social order, called ha\u1e41sa, in which one comes under the direct supervision of the Personality of Godhead. In the modern age people are crying out for social equality, but unless all human beings are situated in the mode of goodness, which is the position of purity and unalloyed devotion, social equality is not possible. As the lower modes of nature become prominent, secondary religious principles arise, by which people may be gradually elevated to the pure stage of unalloyed surrender to God. In Satya-yuga there are no inferior human beings, and thus there is no need of secondary religious principles. Everyone directly takes to the unalloyed service of the Lord, fulfilling perfectly all religious obligations. In Sanskrit, one who perfectly executes all duties is called k\u1e5bta-k\u1e5btya, as mentioned in this verse. Therefore Satya-yuga is called K\u1e5bta-yuga, or the age of perfect religious action. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the word \u0101dau (\u201cin the beginning\u201d) refers to the moment of universal creation. In other words, the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system is not a recent concoction but naturally arises at the time of creation and should therefore be accepted by all intelligent human beings."

In Europe and America, we have practically observed that the standards of cleanliness are abominable even among so-called educated persons. Going without bathing and the use of indecent language are common. In the modern age people whimsically speak whatever they like, dispensing with all authority, and there is therefore very little truthfulness or true wisdom. Similarly, in both the capitalistic and communistic countries, everyone is busily engaged in stealing and robbing from everyone else in the name of business, taxation or outright crime. People are not confident of the kingdom of God nor of their own eternal nature, and thus their faith is very weak. Moreover, since modern human beings are not very interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness they constantly quarrel, bicker and fight over completely insignificant issues relating to the material body. Thus at the slightest provocation there are huge wars and massacres. Lust, anger and hankering have become practically unlimited in Kali-yuga. The symptoms and characteristics mentioned here can be abundantly observed throughout the world, wherever people have fallen away from the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system. Because of sinful habits such as animal killing, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling, the great majority of human beings have become ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las, or untouchables."

        "purport": " The term dvija, or \u201ctwice-born,\u201d here indicates the three superior classes, namely br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas, who all receive the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra, which signifies their second birth through spiritual initiation. One\u2019s first birth is biological, or seminal, and does not necessarily indicate that one is intelligent or enlightened. A young br\u0101hma\u1e47a boy, if qualified, may be initiated with G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra at the age of twelve, and k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas a few years later. In order to become enlightened with spiritual knowledge, the boy resides within the gurukula, or \u0101\u015brama of the spiritual master. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness has established similar gurukulas all over the world and is issuing a great call to civilized human beings to arrange for the proper education of their children. Every young boy and girl should learn to be self-controlled and should become enlightened through study of authorized Vedic literatures. In this way, unlike ordinary animals, insects, fish and birds, etc., an enlightened human being may take birth twice and thus become perfect in the knowledge that leads to ultimate liberation. The word \u0101nup\u016brvy\u0101t in this verse indicates the system of sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras, or purificatory rites, beginning with garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, or the purification of the sexual act. Generally, \u015b\u016bdras and those who do not follow the Vedic system are not attracted to such purificatory ceremonies; therefore they remain ignorant of spiritual life and envious of the bona fide spiritual master. Those whose character has been civilized by a systematic cleansing process give up the tendency to be argumentative and whimsical and instead become submissive and eager to learn in the presence of a bona fide spiritual master."

        "purport": " This verse appears in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 1.46). His Divine Grace O\u1e41 Vi\u1e63\u1e47up\u0101da Paramaha\u1e41sa Parivr\u0101jak\u0101c\u0101rya A\u1e63\u1e6dottara-\u015bata \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bmad A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da has commented on this verse as follows. \u201cThis is a verse from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.17.27) spoken by Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when He was questioned by Uddhava regarding the four social and spiritual orders of society. He was specifically instructing how a brahmac\u0101r\u012b should behave under the care of a spiritual master. A spiritual master is not an enjoyer of facilities offered by his disciples. He is like a parent. Without the attentive service of his parents, a child cannot grow to manhood; similarly, without the care of the spiritual master one cannot rise to the plane of transcendental service. \u201cThe spiritual master is also called \u0101c\u0101rya, or a transcendental professor of spiritual science. Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (2.140) explains the duties of an \u0101c\u0101rya, describing that a bona fide spiritual maser accepts charge of disciples, teaches them the Vedic knowledge with all its intricacies, and gives them their second birth. The ceremony performed to initiate a disciple into the study of spiritual science is called upan\u012bti, or the function that brings one nearer to the spiritual master. One who cannot be brought nearer to a spiritual master cannot have a sacred thread, and thus he is indicated to be a \u015b\u016bdra. The sacred thread worn on the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya or vai\u015bya is a symbol of initiation by the spiritual master; it is worth nothing if worn merely to boast of high parentage. The duty of the spiritual master is to initiate a disciple with the sacred thread ceremony, and after this sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, or purificatory process, the spiritual master actually begins to teach the disciple about the Vedas. A person born a \u015b\u016bdra is not barred from such spiritual initiation, provided he is approved by the spiritual master, who is duly authorized to award a disciple the right to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a if he finds him perfectly qualified. In the V\u0101yu Pur\u0101\u1e47a an \u0101c\u0101rya is defined as one who knows the import of all the Vedic literatures, explains the purpose of the Vedas, abides by their rules and regulations, and teaches his disciples to act in the same way. \u201cOnly out of His immense compassion does the Personality of Godhead reveal Himself as the spiritual master. Therefore in the dealings of an \u0101c\u0101rya there are no activities but those of transcendental loving service to the Lord. He is the Supreme Personality of Servitor Godhead. It is worthwhile to take shelter of such a steady devotee, who is called \u0101\u015braya-vigraha, or the manifestation or form of the Lord of whom one must take shelter. \u201cIf one poses himself as an \u0101c\u0101rya but does not have an attitude of servitorship to the Lord, he must be considered an offender, and this offensive attitude disqualifies him from being an \u0101c\u0101rya. The bona fide spiritual master always engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By this test he is known to be a direct manifestation of the Lord and a genuine representative of \u015ar\u012b Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu. Such a spiritual master is known as \u0101c\u0101ryadeva. Influenced by an envious temperament and dissatisfied because of an attitude of sense gratification, mundaners criticize a real \u0101c\u0101rya. In fact, however, a bona fide \u0101c\u0101rya is nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead, and therefore to envy such an \u0101c\u0101rya is to envy the Personality of Godhead Himself. This will produce an effect subversive to transcendental realization. \u201cAs mentioned previously, a disciple should always respect the spiritual master as a manifestation of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but at the same time one should always remember that a spiritual master is never authorized to imitate the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. False spiritual masters pose themselves as identical with \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in every respect, to exploit the sentiments of their disciples, but such impersonalists can only mislead their disciples, for their ultimate aim is to become one with the Lord. This is against the principles of the devotional cult. \u201cThe real Vedic philosophy is acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva, which establishes everything to be simultaneously one with and different from the Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b confirms that this is the real position of a bona fide spiritual master and says that one should always think of the spiritual master in terms of his intimate relationship with Mukunda (\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a). \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, in his Bhakti-sandarbha (213), has clearly defined that a pure devotee\u2019s observation of the spiritual master and Lord \u015aiva as one with the Personality of Godhead exists in terms of their being very dear to the Lord, not identical with Him in all respects. Following in the footsteps of \u015ar\u012bla Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, later \u0101c\u0101ryas like \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura have confirmed the same truths. In his prayers to the spiritual master, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura confirms that all the revealed scriptures accept the spiritual master to be identical with the Personality of Godhead because he is a very dear and confidential servant of the Lord. Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas therefore worship \u015ar\u012bla Gurudeva (the spiritual master) in the light of his being the servitor of the Personality of Godhead. In all the ancient literatures of devotional service and in the more recent songs of \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura and other unalloyed Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, the spiritual master is always considered to be either one of the confidential associates of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b or a manifested representation of \u015ar\u012bla Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu.\u201d"

Every living entity must ultimately be trained to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but until one has become expert in the techniques of spiritual service one should offer everything to the spiritual master, who is completely realized in the process of worshiping the Lord. When the spiritual master sees that the disciple is advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he then engages the disciple in directly worshiping the Personality of Godhead. A bona fide spiritual master does not use anything for his personal sense gratification and entrusts to his disciple only as much material opulence as the disciple can properly offer to the lotus feet of the Lord. The example may be given that when an ordinary father tries to train his son in business and other material activities, he entrusts to the son only as much wealth as the son can intelligently engage in profitable enterprises without foolishly wasting the father\u2019s hard-earned money. Similarly, the bona fide spiritual master teaches his disciple to worship the Lord, and an immature disciple must simply deliver everything to the lotus feet of the guru, just as an immature child does not keep a personal bank account but rather receives his maintenance from the father, who trains the son to be responsible. If one cheats oneself by defying the order of a bona fide spiritual master or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one certainly becomes a nondevotee, or sense enjoyer, and falls from the spiritual path. Therefore, one should be trained to serve a bona fide spiritual master and thus become mature in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

The spirit soul is more brilliant than the sun, and as the process of spiritual purification gradually takes effect, even the external form of a devotee becomes effulgent. The glowing fire of spiritual knowledge burns to ashes the mentality of sense gratification, and one naturally becomes austere and disinterested in mundane enjoyment. Among all austerities, the best is celibacy, by which the shackles of material life immediately become slackened. One who is amala, free from material desire, is known as a pure devotee of the Lord. On the paths of j\u00f1\u0101na, karma and yoga the mind retains the concept of personal interest, but on the path of pure devotion the mind is trained to see only the interests of the Personality of Godhead.

        "purport": " This verse describes the process called sam\u0101vartana, or returning to one\u2019s home after finishing Vedic education in the \u0101\u015brama of the spiritual master. One who cannot concentrate all of his desires in the devotional service of the Lord is attracted to householder life, and if this attraction is not regulated, one will fall down. Being covered by the ignorance of fruitive activities and mental speculation, a living entity seeks enjoyment outside the devotional service of the Supreme Lord and becomes a nondevotee. One who takes to family life must rigidly follow the Vedic rules and regulations in order to avoid the collapse of his spiritual determination. One who enjoys intimate sense gratification with women must become duplicitous in his dealings with others and consequently falls down from the platform of simple, pure life. When the mind is disturbed by lust, one begins to resent the principle of submission to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotee, and the dark clouds of one\u2019s offensive mentality completely cover the light of spiritual knowledge. One should dovetail his propensity to love someone by serving the lotus feet of a pure devotee. As stated in Vedic literature, \u201cOne who worships Govinda, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but does not worship His devotees is not to be considered an advanced Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava; rather, he is to be considered a proud hypocrite.\u201d"

One who is not surrendered to Me should move progressively from one \u0101\u015brama to another, never acting otherwise.",
        "purport": " Those who are not surrendered devotees of the Lord must rigidly observe the regulations governing one\u2019s authorized social status. There are four social divisions of life, namely brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. One who wants to fulfill material desires should become an ordinary householder (g\u1e5bhastha), establish a comfortable residence and maintain his family. One desiring to accelerate the process of purification may give up his home and business and live in a sacred place with his wife, as indicated here by the word vanam, or \u201cforest.\u201d There are many sacred forests in India meant for this purpose, such as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and M\u0101y\u0101pur. The word dvijottama indicates the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas are all dvija, or initiated in the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra, but the br\u0101hma\u1e47a is dvijottama, or the highest among those who have received second birth by spiritual initiation. It is recommended that a purified br\u0101hma\u1e47a take to the renounced order of life (sanny\u0101sa), giving up further contact with his so-called wife. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a is specifically mentioned here, since k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas are not to take the renounced order of life. Even so, there are many stories in the Bh\u0101gavatam wherein great kings retire with their aristocratic wives to the forest to practice the austerities of v\u0101naprastha and thus accelerate the process of purification. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, however, may directly accept the renounced order of life. The words \u0101\u015bram\u0101d \u0101\u015brama\u1e41 gacchet indicate that one may progressively move from brahmac\u0101r\u012b life to g\u1e5bhastha life to v\u0101naprastha life and then to sanny\u0101sa. The words \u0101\u015bram\u0101d \u0101\u015bramam emphasize that one should never remain without an authorized social status, nor should one go backward, falling down from a higher position. Those who are not surrendered devotees of the Lord must rigidly observe such injunctions, for otherwise they will quickly become degraded, and their sins will place them outside the bounds of authorized human civilization. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a emphasizes here that a nondevotee must rigidly observe the rituals and regulations of Vedic social divisions, whereas the Lord\u2019s pure devotee, engaged twenty-four hours a day in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mission, is transcendental to such divisions. If, however, one performs illicit activities on the strength of being transcendental to Vedic social divisions, one is revealed to be a materialistic neophyte and not an advanced devotee of the Lord. An advanced devotee, who remains aloof from material sense gratification, is not bound by the Vedic social divisions; thus even a householder may live very austerely, traveling and preaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness away from home, and even a sanny\u0101s\u012b may sometimes engage women in the devotional service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The most advanced devotees cannot be restricted by the rituals and regulations of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, and they move freely around the world distributing love of Godhead. Mat-para indicates a pure devotee of the Lord who always keeps the Lord fixed in his heart and consciousness. One who falls down to become a victim of sense gratification is not fully established on the platform of mat-para and should rigidly observe the social divisions and regulations to remain steady on the platform of pious human life."

        "purport": " As stated in the Vedic literature, The purport of this verse is that one\u2019s first wife must always be sad\u1e5b\u015b\u012bm, or similar to oneself. In other words, an intellectual man should marry an intellectual wife, a heroic man should marry a heroic wife, a business minded man should marry a woman who can encourage him in such activities, and a \u015b\u016bdra should marry a less intelligent woman. The wife must be beyond reproach in terms of her background and character and should always be younger than oneself, ideally five to ten years younger. If one desires to marry a second wife, then, as stated in this verse by the word var\u1e47\u0101nup\u016brvye\u1e47a and in the verse spoken by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by the word anukram\u0101t, one must wait until the first marriage is established and then select a second wife from the next-lower caste. If one marries a third time the wife must be, again, from the next-lower caste. For example, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s first wife will be a br\u0101hma\u1e47\u012b, his second wife will be from the k\u1e63atriya community, his third wife from the vai\u015bya community and fourth wife from the \u015b\u016bdra community. A k\u1e63atriya may first marry a k\u1e63atriya lady and then vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra ladies. A vai\u015bya can accept wives from two classes, and a \u015b\u016bdra will accept a wife only from the \u015b\u016bdra class. By this progression of marriages there will be relative peace in the family. These Vedic marriage injunctions, as mentioned in the previous verse, are especially for those who are not pure devotees of the Lord."

        "purport": " One may ask why a br\u0101hma\u1e47a should voluntarily accept inconvenience in keeping his body and soul together. In this verse the Lord explains that advanced human life is meant for serious austerity and not for insignificant sense gratification. By spiritual advancement one is fixed in transcendental bliss on the spiritual platform and gives up useless absorption in the temporary material body. One should remain detached from the material body, accepting only the bare necessities of life. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, by accepting a troublesome form of livelihood, never forget that the material body is destined to grow old, become diseased and die in misery. Thus remaining alert and transcendental, an advanced br\u0101hma\u1e47a, at the end of this life, goes back home, back to Godhead, where he enjoys unlimited spiritual bliss. Without such higher awareness, how can one be considered a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a? Those devotees engaged twenty-four hours a day in spreading the mission of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are beyond the platform of renunciation or sense gratification because they engage everything in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. A pure devotee of the Lord eats only to get strength for serving the Lord and does not accept either sumptuous or meager food simply for the body\u2019s sake. However, everything may be accepted for the Lord, even sumptuous meals. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a who is not working day and night to spread the glories of the Lord should feel embarrassed to eat sumptuously for his personal sense gratification, but a renounced Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava preacher may accept invitations from all classes of pious people, and just to bless their homes he will eat the opulent foods they offer to him. Similarly, he sometimes eats sumptuously to get strength for defeating atheists and impersonalists. As stated in Vedic literature, one cannot be a highly qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a unless one becomes a devotee of the Lord. And among the devotees, those who are preaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are the best, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."

We are now associated with many relatives, friends and well-wishers, but as soon as we change our material body we will immediately be separated from all these associates, just as upon awakening we are immediately separated from the imaginary situation of a dream. One becomes attached to the sense gratification of one\u2019s dream, and similarly, under the spell of the illusory concepts of \u201cI\u201d and \u201cmine,\u201d we become attached to so-called relatives and friends who gratify our sense of false ego. Unfortunately, such fleeting egoistic association covers our real knowledge of the self and the Supreme, and we remain hovering in material illusion, futilely endeavoring for permanent sense gratification. One who remains attached to the bodily concept of family and friends cannot possibly give up the false egoism of \u201cI\u201d and \u201cmine,\u201d or \u201cI am everything and everything is mine.\u201d Without giving up material sense gratification we cannot become steady on the transcendental platform of devotional service, and therefore we cannot relish the actual flavor of eternal happiness. Unless one becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, accepting Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as one\u2019s only friend, one cannot give up the hankering for temporary and superficial material relationships. A traveler far away from his home and loved ones may strike up superficial conversations with other travelers, but such relationships have no ultimate meaning. One should therefore revive one\u2019s lost relationship with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We are constitutionally part and parcel of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the reservoir of all spiritual pleasure, and our original relationship with Him is full of love and happiness. But because of our desire to enjoy independently from Him, we fall down into the confusing, meaningless network of material relationships created by m\u0101y\u0101. An intelligent person realizes there is no actual pleasure or satisfaction for the soul on either this planet or any other material planet. Therefore, like a weary traveler exhausted from his journey, he should go back home, back to Godhead, for eternal peace as the faithful servant of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

In this status, called mukta-sa\u1e45ga, one no longer identifies oneself as a permanent resident of the material world. This liberated status may be attained even by one situated in family life. The only requirement is that one should take up a serious program of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, which includes constant chanting of the holy names of the Lord, worship of the Deity and participation in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Without a serious program of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtana it is very difficult to give up the iron shackles of attachment to women and the byproducts of such attachment."
