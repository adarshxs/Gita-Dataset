        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Uddhava, by associating with My pure devotees one can destroy one\u2019s attachment for all objects of material sense gratification. Such purifying association brings Me under the control of My devotee. One may perform the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga system, engage in philosophical analysis of the elements of material nature, practice nonviolence and other ordinary principles of piety, chant the Vedas, perform penances, take to the renounced order of life, execute sacrificial performances and dig wells, plant trees and perform other public welfare activities, give in charity, carry out severe vows, worship the demigods, chant confidential mantras, visit holy places or accept major and minor disciplinary injunctions, but even by performing such activities one does not bring Me under his control.",
        "purport": " The commentary of \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b on these two verses can be summarized as follows. One may serve the devotees of the Lord by assisting them or by having their personal association. Association with pure devotees is sufficient for self-realization because one can learn everything about spiritual advancement from such devotees. With perfect knowledge one can achieve all that one desires, for the process of devotional service immediately brings the blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pure devotional service is transcendental to the modes of nature, and therefore it appears mysterious to the souls conditioned by those modes. In the previous chapter Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stated, havi\u1e63\u0101gnau yajeta m\u0101m: \u201cOne may worship Me in fire by offering oblations of ghee.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.11.43) Also, in verse 38 of the previous chapter it was mentioned that one should construct parks, recreational places, orchards, vegetable gardens, and so on. These serve to attract people to the temples of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, where they may directly engage in chanting the holy name of the Lord. Such construction projects may be understood as p\u016brtam, or public welfare activities. Although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mentions in these two verses that association with His pure devotees is far more powerful than processes such as yoga, philosophical speculation, sacrifices and public welfare activities, these secondary activities also please Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but to a lesser extent. Specifically, they please the Lord when performed by devotees rather than by ordinary materialistic persons. Therefore the comparative term yath\u0101 (\u201caccording to proportion\u201d) is used. In other words, such practices as sacrifice, austerity and philosophical study may help one become fit for rendering devotional service, and when such activities are performed by devotees aspiring for spiritual advancement, they become somewhat pleasing to the Lord. One may study the example of vrat\u0101ni, or vows. The injunction that one should fast on Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b is a permanent vow for all Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, and one should not conclude from these verses that one may neglect the Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b vow. The superiority of sat-sa\u1e45ga, or association with pure devotees, in awarding the fruit of love of Godhead does not mean that one should give up other processes or that these secondary processes are not permanent factors in bhakti-yoga. There are many Vedic injunctions instructing one to execute the agnihotra sacrifice, and the modern-day followers of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also occasionally execute fire sacrifices. Such sacrifice is recommended by the Lord Himself in the previous chapter, and therefore it should not be given up by the devotees of the Lord. By performing Vedic ritualistic and purificatory processes, one is gradually elevated to the platform of devotional service, whereupon one is able to directly worship the Absolute Truth. One Vedic injunction states, \u201cThe result awarded for fasting continuously for one month on six different occasions can easily be achieved simply by accepting a handful of rice offered to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This facility is especially offered in the Kali-yuga.\u201d Nevertheless, regulated fasting on Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b is not an impediment to spiritual advancement. Rather, it is a perpetual aspect of devotional service and can be considered an auxiliary principle supporting the main principle of worshiping Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotees. Because such secondary principles help one become fit for executing the primary processes of devotional service, they are also greatly beneficial. Therefore, such secondary principles are widely mentioned throughout Vedic literature. It may be concluded that such secondary principles are essential for advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore one should never give up the principle of vrata, the execution of prescribed vows. In the previous chapter \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b mentioned that the words \u0101j\u00f1\u0101yaiva\u1e41 gu\u1e47\u0101n do\u1e63\u0101n (Bh\u0101g. 11.11.32) indicate that a devotee should select Vedic principles that do not conflict with his service to the Lord. Many of the elaborate Vedic ceremonies and complicated procedures for fasting, demigod worship and yoga practice cause great disturbance to the supreme process of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, hearing and chanting about the Lord; therefore they are rejected by the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. However, the processes helpful to devotional service should be accepted. The example can be given of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, who was instructed by the dying Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.9.27) Bh\u012b\u1e63ma instructs King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira in d\u0101na-dharma, or public acts of charity, r\u0101ja-dharma, or the duties of a king, mok\u1e63a-dharma, or duties for salvation, str\u012b-dharma, or duties for women, and ultimately bh\u0101gavata-dharma, or pure devotional service to the Lord. Bh\u012b\u1e63ma did not limit his discussion to bh\u0101gavata-dharma, because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira the devotional service of acting as a king, and to execute his service Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira Mah\u0101r\u0101ja required extensive knowledge of civic affairs. However, one who is not rendering such prescribed devotional service in society should not unnecessarily involve himself in the material world, even by practice of Vedic rituals. Nothing should distract him from the ultimate goal of satisfying Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The principle of not giving up prescribed vows may be further illustrated by the example of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. In the Ninth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam we find that although Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a performed elaborate Vedic sacrifices, his goal was always the satisfaction of the Lord. The citizens in his kingdom did not desire to go to heaven, because they were always hearing about the glories of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, along with his queen, observed the vow of Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b and Dv\u0101da\u015b\u012b for one year. Since Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is considered to be a great jewel among Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, and since his behavior was always exemplary, it is definitely concluded that such vows as fasting on Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b are imperative for Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. It is further stated in Vedic literature, \u201cIf due to negligence a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava does not fast on Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b, then his worship of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is useless, and he will go to hell.\u201d The members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness fast from grains and beans on Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b, and this vow should always be observed by all of its members. If one falsely thinks that one may obtain the association of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a merely by great austerities, brilliant studies in Sanskrit literature, magnanimous acts of charity, etc., one\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will be distorted and weakened. One should remember the example of Lord Caitanya, who practiced K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by constantly hearing and chanting about Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If by fasting, study, austerity or sacrifice one becomes more fit to participate in the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement of Lord Caitanya, then such activities are also pleasing to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But the Lord clearly explains here that such activities can never become central in the practice of bhakti-yoga. They must remain in an auxiliary relationship to the supreme process of sat-sa\u1e45ga, or association with pure devotees who hear and chant the glories of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted from Vedic literature that if one offends the Lord\u2019s devotees and does not learn to associate with them, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u personally places barriers in the path of such a person so that he may not enter into the Lord\u2019s company."

        "translation": "In every yuga many living entities entangled in the modes of passion and ignorance gained the association of My devotees. Thus, such living entities as the Daityas, R\u0101k\u1e63asas, birds, beasts, Gandharvas, Apsar\u0101s, N\u0101gas, Siddhas, C\u0101ra\u1e47as, Guhyakas and Vidy\u0101dharas, as well as such lower-class human beings as the vai\u015byas, \u015b\u016bdras, women and others, were able to achieve My supreme abode. V\u1e5btr\u0101sura, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and others like them also achieved My abode by association with My devotees, as did personalities such as V\u1e5b\u1e63aparv\u0101, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, B\u0101\u1e47\u0101sura, Maya, Vibh\u012b\u1e63a\u1e47a, Sugr\u012bva, Hanum\u0101n, J\u0101mbav\u0101n, Gajendra, Ja\u1e6d\u0101yu, Tul\u0101dh\u0101ra, Dharma-vy\u0101dha, Kubj\u0101, the gop\u012bs in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and the wives of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who were performing sacrifice.",
        "purport": " The Lord has mentioned devotees such as the gop\u012bs in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and also demons like B\u0101\u1e47\u0101sura to illustrate how He comes under the control of those who surrender to Him. It is understood that devotees like the gop\u012bs and others mentioned here obtained pure love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas the demons generally obtained only salvation. Many demons were purified by association with devotees and came to accept devotional service to the Lord as the most important among the various activities in their lives, but the exalted devotees like Prahl\u0101da and Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja know nothing except devotional service, which they accept as their very life. Still, the reformed demons are also mentioned so that readers of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam will understand the enormous benefits one may achieve by associating with devotees of the Lord. The demon V\u1e5btr\u0101sura was the pious King Citraketu in his previous life, during which he associated with \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni, \u015ar\u012b A\u1e45gir\u0101 Muni and Lord Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, being the son of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, is considered a Daitya, or demon. Yet while still in the womb of his mother, Kay\u0101dh\u016b, he associated with N\u0101rada Muni by sound vibration. The demon V\u1e5b\u1e63aparv\u0101 was abandoned by his mother at birth, but he was raised by a muni and became a devotee of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja associated with his grandfather Prahl\u0101da and also with Lord V\u0101manadeva. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s son, B\u0101\u1e47\u0101sura, was saved by association with his father and Lord \u015aiva. He also associated with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally when the Lord cut off all but two of his one thousand arms, which had been awarded as a benediction by Lord \u015aiva. Understanding the glories of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, B\u0101\u1e47\u0101sura also became a great devotee. The demon Maya D\u0101nava constructed an assembly house for the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and also associated with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, eventually achieving the shelter of the Lord. Vibh\u012b\u1e63a\u1e47a was a pious-natured demon, the brother of R\u0101va\u1e47a, and he associated with Hanum\u0101n and R\u0101macandra. Sugr\u012bva, Hanum\u0101n, J\u0101mbav\u0101n and Gajendra are examples of animals who achieved the mercy of the Lord. J\u0101mbav\u0101n, or \u1e5ak\u1e63ar\u0101ja, was a member of a race of bears. He personally associated with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, fighting with Him over the Syamantaka jewel. The elephant Gajendra in a previous life had association with devotees, and at the end of his life as Gajendra he was personally saved by the Lord. Ja\u1e6d\u0101yu, the bird who at the cost of his own life assisted Lord R\u0101macandra, associated with \u015ar\u012b Garu\u1e0da and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Da\u015baratha as well as other devotees in r\u0101ma-l\u012bl\u0101. He also personally met with S\u012bt\u0101 and Lord R\u0101ma. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the association that the Gandharvas, Apsar\u0101s, N\u0101gas, Siddhas, C\u0101ra\u1e47as, Guhyakas and Vidy\u0101dharas had with the devotees is not very prominent and does not need to be mentioned. Va\u1e47ikpatha is a vai\u015bya, and his story is mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata in connection with the pride of J\u0101jali Muni. The importance of association with devotees is illustrated in the story of Dharma-vy\u0101dha, the nonviolent hunter, as described in the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a. In a previous life he somehow became a brahma-r\u0101k\u1e63asa, or br\u0101hma\u1e47a ghost, but was eventually saved. In a previous Kali-yuga he had the association of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava king named V\u0101su. The lady Kubj\u0101 associated directly with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and in her previous birth she had associated with \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni. The gop\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana rendered service to saintly persons in their previous births. Having had ample association with devotees, they became gop\u012bs in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in their next lives and associated with the eternally liberated gop\u012bs who had descended there. They also had association with Tulas\u012b-dev\u012b, or V\u1e5bnd\u0101dev\u012b. The wives of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as performing sacrifice had association with women sent by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to sell flower garlands and betel nuts and heard about the Lord from them."

        "purport": " Although innumerable living entities achieved liberation by association with the Lord and His devotees, many such personalities also executed other processes such as austerity, charity, philosophical speculation, and so on. As we have already explained, such procedures are secondary. But the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana such as the gop\u012bs did not know anything except Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and their whole purpose in life was simply to love Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as indicated here by the words kevalena hi bh\u0101vena. Even the trees, bushes and hills such as Govardhana loved Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As the Lord explains to His brother, \u015ar\u012b Baladeva, in the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.15.5): \u201cMy dear brother Baladeva, just see how these trees are bowing down with their branches and offering obeisances to Your lotus feet, which are worshipable even by the demigods. Indeed, My dear brother, You are the Supreme God, and thus these trees have produced fruits and flowers as an offering to You. Although a living entity takes birth as a tree due to the mode of ignorance, certainly by such a birth in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana these trees are destroying all darkness in their lives by serving Your lotus feet.\u201d Although many living entities achieved the mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by associating with the Lord and His devotees in various ways, those who take Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as everything are situated in the highest process of spiritual realization. Therefore the Lord has not bothered to mention in this verse those who achieved perfection through mixed processes, but rather glorifies the unalloyed devotees of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, headed by the gop\u012bs, who knew nothing but Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana were so satisfied in their relationships with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that they did not pollute their loving service with mental speculation or fruitive desires. The gop\u012bs served Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the conjugal rasa, or relationship, whereas according to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura the cows loved Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in v\u0101tsalya-rasa, or the love of parents for a child, because the cows were always supplying milk to child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Unmoving objects like Govardhana Hill and other hills and mountains loved Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a friend, and the ordinary animals, trees and bushes of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana loved Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in d\u0101sya-rasa, or with love of a servant for his master. Snakes like K\u0101liya also developed this love in servitude, and after relishing their loving service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all of them went back home, back to Godhead. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, all those inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana should be considered eternally liberated souls, as expressed by the word siddh\u0101\u1e25, which means \u201chaving achieved the perfection of life.\u201d"

Anyone who is favorably living with the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes sat, or eternal, and thus the association of such a person can immediately award others pure devotional service to the Lord.

The gop\u012bs loved Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so much that in His absence their consciousness was completely absorbed in spiritual love. Thus their K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is considered the highest perfectional stage of life. They were always expecting that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would finish His business of killing demons and return to them, and therefore their anxiety was an extremely moving, heartrending display of love. Anyone desiring true happiness must take to the devotional service of the Lord in the spirit of the gop\u012bs, giving up everything for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord."

Their consciousness was intensely and intimately attached to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and by such K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness their own bodies seemed very far away from them, even though people normally consider their body to be their closest possession. In fact, the gop\u012bs did not think about their own existence. Although a young woman normally considers her husband and children to be her dearmost possessions, the gop\u012bs did not even consider the existence of their so-called families. Nor could they think of this world or life after death. Indeed, they were not at all aware of these things. Just like great sages who become detached from the names and forms of the material world, the gop\u012bs could not think of anything, because they were rapt in loving remembrance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Just as rivers enter the ocean, similarly, the gop\u012bs completely merged into consciousness of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through intense love.\u201d Thus a day of Brahm\u0101 seemed like a single moment for the gop\u012bs when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present with them, and a single moment seemed like a day of Brahm\u0101 when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was absent. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness of the gop\u012bs is the perfection of spiritual life, and the symptoms of such perfection are described here."

Their entire consciousness was simply bound up in Me.",
        "purport": " The words svam \u0101tm\u0101nam adas tathedam indicate that while for ordinary persons one\u2019s personal body is the most near and dear thing, the gop\u012bs considered their own bodies to be distant and remote, just as a yog\u012b in sam\u0101dhi trance considers ordinary things around his physical body or his physical body itself to be most remote. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a played on His flute late at night, the gop\u012bs immediately forgot everything about their so-called husbands and children and went to dance with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the forest. These controversial points have been clearly explained in the book K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da. The basic explanation is that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of everything, and the gop\u012bs are the Lord\u2019s own potency. Thus there is no discrepancy or immorality in the almighty Personality of Godhead\u2019s loving affairs with His own manifest potency, the gop\u012bs, who happen to be the most beautiful young girls in the creation of God. There is no illusion on the part of the gop\u012bs, for they are so attracted to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that they do not care to think of anything else. Since all existence is situated within the body of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is no loss for the gop\u012bs when they concentrate on the Lord. It is the nature of very deep love to exclude all objects except the beloved. However, in the material world, where we try to love a limited temporary object such as our nation, family or personal body, our exclusion of other objects constitutes ignorance. But when our love is intensely concentrated on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the origin of everything, such concentration cannot be considered ignorance or small-mindedness. The example of the sages in sam\u0101dhi is given here only to illustrate exclusive concentration on a single object. Otherwise, there is no comparison between the ecstatic love of the gop\u012bs and the dry meditation of the yog\u012bs, who merely try to understand that they are not their material bodies. Since the gop\u012bs had no material bodies to become detached from and were personally dancing with and embracing the Absolute Truth, one can never compare the exalted position of the gop\u012bs to that of mere yog\u012bs. It is stated that the bliss of impersonal Brahman realization cannot be compared to even an atomic fragment of the blissful ocean of love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Intimate attachment is like a strong rope that binds the mind and heart. In material life we are bound to that which is temporary and illusory, and therefore such binding of the heart causes great pain. However, if we bind our minds and hearts to the eternal Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the reservoir of all pleasure and beauty, then our hearts will expand unlimitedly in the ocean of transcendental bliss. One should understand that the gop\u012bs were not in any way inclined toward impersonal meditation, in which one denies the reality of variegated creation. The gop\u012bs did not deny anything; they simply loved K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and could not think of anything else. They only rejected whatever impeded their concentration on Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, cursing even their own eyelids, which blinked and thus removed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from their sight for a split second. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated that all sincere devotees of the Lord should have the courage to remove from their lives anything that impedes their progressive march back home, back to Godhead."

In Sanskrit the word vid also means \u201cto acquire.\u201d Thus, asvar\u016bpa-vida\u1e25 indicates that the gop\u012bs, like other pure devotees of the Lord, were not interested in achieving s\u0101r\u016bpya-mukti, the liberation of acquiring a bodily form similar to the Lord\u2019s. Were the gop\u012bs to obtain a bodily form like the Lord\u2019s, how could the Lord execute His conjugal pastimes of dancing with the gop\u012bs and embracing them? Since the gop\u012bs had realized their eternal spiritual forms as servitors of the Lord, the word svar\u016bpa also may indicate their own spiritual bodies, and thus asvar\u016bpa-vida\u1e25 means that the gop\u012bs never thought, as materialists do, of their own bodily beauty. Although the gop\u012bs are the most beautiful girls in the Lord\u2019s creation, they never thought of their own bodies but rather were always meditating on the transcendental body of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although we cannot imitate the gop\u012b\u2019s exalted conjugal feelings, we can follow their superb example of practical K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They naturally took shelter of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and achieved the highest perfection of life."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012b Uddhava inquired from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a about the symptoms of saintly persons and liberated souls, and the Lord has replied in terms of different levels of spiritual advancement, distinguishing between those who are able to understand Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the principal goal of life and those loving devotees who accept Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and devotional service to Him as the only goal of life. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also mentioned that He is captured by His loving devotees and even by those who sincerely associate with His loving devotees. Among all the devotees, the gop\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana were described by the Lord as having achieved such a rare state of pure devotional service that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally feels constantly indebted to them. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a previously kept the gop\u012bs\u2019 love for Him concealed in His heart because of its confidential nature and the Lord\u2019s own gravity. Finally, however, even Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could not remain silent about the intense love of the gop\u012bs, and thus in these verses the Lord reveals to Uddhava how the gop\u012bs loved Him in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and brought Him fully under their control. The Lord would relax in secret places with the loving gop\u012bs, and by conjugal spontaneous affection the greatest love was exchanged between them. As explained by the Lord in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one cannot achieve the perfection of life merely by renouncing the material world or by executing ordinary, sectarian religious principles. One must actually understand the identity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and by associating with His pure devotees one must learn to love the Lord in His personal, original form. This love may be expressed in either the conjugal, parental, fraternal or serving rasa, or relationship. The Lord has elaborately explained to Uddhava the system of philosophical analysis of the material world, and now He clearly concludes that it is useless for Uddhava to waste time in fruitive activities or mental speculation. Actually, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is hinting that Uddhava should assimilate the example of the gop\u012bs and try to advance further in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by following in the footsteps of the cowherd damsels of Vraja. Any conditioned soul who is unsatisfied with the cruel laws of nature, which impose disease, old age and death, should understand that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can deliver all living beings from the problems of material existence. There is no need to entangle oneself in unauthorized, sectarian rituals, injunctions or prohibitions. One should simply surrender to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, following the example of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. By the authorized regulated process of bhakti-yoga, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one easily achieves spiritual perfection."

        "purport": " In the first verse of the Tenth Chapter of this canto, the Lord stated that one should take shelter of Him and execute one\u2019s duties within the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system without material desire. Uddhava interpreted this statement as recommending karma-mi\u015br\u0101 bhakti, or devotional service mixed with a tendency toward fruitive activities. It is a fact that until one understands Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be everything, it is not possible to retire from ordinary, worldly duties. Rather, one is encouraged to offer the fruits of such work to the Lord. In verse 4 of the Tenth Chapter, the Lord recommended that one retire from worldly duties and systematically cultivate knowledge, accepting Him as the Supreme. Uddhava understood this instruction to indicate j\u00f1\u0101na-mi\u015br\u0101 bhakti, or devotional service to the Lord mixed with the secondary desire to accumulate knowledge. Beginning with verse 35 of the Tenth Chapter, Uddhava inquired about the process of material conditioning and liberation from material life. The Lord replied elaborately, stating that without devotional service the process of philosophical speculation can never be perfected. In Chapter Eleven, verse 18, the Lord emphasized the importance of faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in verse 23 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a extensively widened His discussion of devotional service, emphasizing that one should be faithful and hear and chant the glories of the Lord. The Lord concluded that both the development and perfection of devotional service depend on association with the devotees. In verse 26 of the Eleventh Chapter, Uddhava inquired about the actual ways and means of devotional service and about the symptoms of devotional perfection. And in verse 48 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stated that unless one takes to the process of devotional service, one\u2019s attempt for liberation will be useless. One must associate with the devotees of the Lord and follow in their footsteps. Finally, in verse 14 of this chapter the Lord categorically rejected the paths of fruitive activities and mental speculation and in verse 15 recommended that one exclusively surrender unto Him with all one\u2019s heart. Having received such elaborate and technical instructions on the perfection of life, Uddhava is bewildered, and his mind is afflicted with doubt about what he should actually do. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has described many procedures and the results of such procedures, all of which ultimately lead to the single goal of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Uddhava therefore desires that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a state in simple terms what should be done. Arjuna makes a similar request of the Lord at the beginning of the Third Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, Uddhava is stating here, \u201cMy dear friend K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, first You recommended that I perform worldly activities within the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, and then You advised that I reject such activities and take to the path of philosophical research. Now rejecting the path of j\u00f1\u0101na, You recommend that I simply surrender unto You in bhakti-yoga. If I accept Your decision, in the future You may again go back to Your original point and recommend worldly activities.\u201d By his boldness in disclosing his mind, Uddhava reveals his intimate friendship with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Uddhava, the Supreme Lord gives life to every living being and is situated within the heart along with the life air and primal sound vibration. The Lord can be perceived in His subtle form within the heart by one\u2019s mind, since the Lord controls the minds of everyone, even great demigods like Lord \u015aiva. The Supreme Lord also assumes a gross form as the various sounds of the Vedas, composed of short and long vowels and consonants of different intonations.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments as follows on the dialogue between Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Uddhava. Uddhava was bewildered and doubtful because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explained many different processes such as devotional service, speculative knowledge, renunciation, mystic yoga, austerities, pious duties, and so on. However, all of these processes are meant to help the living entities obtain the shelter of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and ultimately no Vedic process should be understood in any other way. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explained the entire Vedic system, placing everything in proper order. In fact, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was surprised that Uddhava foolishly thought that he was meant to practice every process, as if each method were meant simply for him. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore wants to inform His devotee, \u201cMy dear Uddhava, when I told you that analytic knowledge is to be practiced, pious duties are to be performed, devotional service is obligatory, yoga procedures must be observed, austerities are to be executed, etc., I was instructing all living entities, using you as My immediate audience. That which I have spoken, am speaking now and will speak in the future should be understood as guidance for all living entities in different situations. How could you possibly think that you were meant to practice all of the different Vedic processes? I accept you as you are now, My pure devotee. You are not supposed to execute all of these processes.\u201d Thus according to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the Lord, with lighthearted and encouraging words, reveals to Uddhava the deep purpose behind the variety of Vedic procedures. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a became manifest from the mouth of Lord Brahm\u0101 in the form of the Vedas. The word vivara-pras\u016bti in this verse also indicates that the Lord is manifest within the \u0101dh\u0101r\u0101di-cakras situated within the body of Lord Brahm\u0101. The word gho\u1e63e\u1e47a means \u201csubtle sound,\u201d and guh\u0101\u1e41 pravi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 also indicates that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enters within the \u0101dh\u0101ra-cakra. The Lord can further be perceived within other cakras such as the ma\u1e47ip\u016braka-cakra, located around the navel, and the vi\u015buddhi-cakra. The Sanskrit alphabet is composed of short and long vowels, and consonants pronounced with high and low tones, and utilizing these vibrations the different branches of Vedic literatures are manifested as a gross form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, such literatures deal mostly with the three modes of material nature: traigu\u1e47ya-vi\u1e63ay\u0101 ved\u0101 nistrai-gu\u1e47yo bhav\u0101rjuna. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b explains that due to the control of the illusory energy, m\u0101y\u0101, the Personality of Godhead appears to the conditioned souls as part of the material universe. The imagined imposition of gross and subtle material qualities on the Personality of Godhead is called avidy\u0101, or ignorance, and through such ignorance the living entity considers himself to be the doer of his own activities and becomes bound up in the network of karma. The Vedas therefore order an entangled soul to observe positive and negative injunctions to purify his existence. These procedures are called prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga, or the path of regulated fruitive activities. When one has purified one\u2019s existence, one gives up this gross stage of fruitive activities because it is detrimental to the practice of pure devotional service. By firm faith one may then worship the Personality of Godhead. One who has developed perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness no longer has to perform ritualistic duties. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, tasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 na vidyate. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, this verse may be understood in another way. The word j\u012bva indicates Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who gives life to the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and vivara-pras\u016bti indicates that although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a eternally performs His pastimes in the spiritual world, beyond the vision of the conditioned souls, He also enters within the material universe to display these same pastimes. The words guh\u0101\u1e41 pravi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 indicates that after displaying such pastimes, the Lord withdraws them and enters into His unmanifest pastimes, or those pastimes not manifest to the conditioned souls. In this case, m\u0101tr\u0101 indicates the transcendental senses of the Lord, svara indicates the Lord\u2019s transcendental sound vibration and singing, and the word var\u1e47a indicates the transcendental form of the Lord. The word sthavi\u1e63\u1e6dha, or \u201cgross manifestation,\u201d means that the Lord becomes manifest in the material world even to those devotees who are not completely advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and whose vision is not completely purified. Mano-maya indicates that somehow or other Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to be kept within one\u2019s mind; and for the nondevotees Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is s\u016bk\u1e63ma, or most subtle, because He cannot be known. Thus different \u0101c\u0101ryas have glorified Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in different ways through the transcendental sound vibration of this verse."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here explains the most confidential meaning of Vedic knowledge. The Vedas first regulate ordinary material work and channel the fruits into ritualistic sacrifices, which ostensibly reward the performer with future benefits. The real purpose of these sacrifices, however, is to accustom a materialistic worker to offering the fruits of his work to a superior Vedic authority. An expert fruitive worker gradually exhausts the possibilities of material enjoyment and naturally gravitates toward the superior stage of philosophical speculation on his existential situation. By increased knowledge, one becomes aware of the unlimited glories of the Supreme and gradually takes to the process of loving devotional service to the transcendental Absolute Truth. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the goal of Vedic knowledge, as the Lord states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. The Lord gradually becomes manifest in the progression of Vedic rituals, just as fire is gradually manifest by the rubbing of firewood. The words havi\u1e63\u0101 samedhate (\u201cthe fire increases by addition of ghee\u201d) indicate that by the progressive advancement of Vedic sacrifice, the fire of spiritual knowledge gradually blazes, illuminating everything and destroying the chain of fruitive work. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered Uddhava to be the most qualified person to hear this elaborate transcendental knowledge; therefore the Lord mercifully instructs Uddhava so that he may enlighten the sages at Badarik\u0101\u015brama, thus fulfilling the purpose of the sages\u2019 lives."

        "translation": "When many seeds are placed in an agricultural field, innumerable manifestations of trees, bushes, vegetables and so on will arise from a single source, the soil. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who gives life to all and is eternal, originally exists beyond the scope of the cosmic manifestation. In the course of time, however, the Lord, who is the resting place of the three modes of nature and the source of the universal lotus flower, in which the cosmic manifestation takes place, divides His material potencies and thus appears to be manifest in innumerable forms, although He is one.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla V\u012brar\u0101ghav\u0101c\u0101rya comments that one may question as to whom the cosmic manifestation, consisting of demigods, men, animals, plants, planets, space, etc., actually belongs. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a now eradicates any doubt about the source of the cosmic manifestation. The word tri-v\u1e5bt indicates that the three modes of nature are not independent but are under superior control. The suffix v\u1e5bt means the vartanam, or \u201cexistence,\u201d of the three modes of material nature within the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Analyzing the term abja-yoni, ap indicates \u201cwater,\u201d and ja indicates \u201cbirth.\u201d Thus abja means the complex material universe, which sprouts from Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who lies in the Garbhodaka Ocean. Yoni, or \u201csource,\u201d indicates the Personality of Godhead, and thus abja-yoni means that the Lord is the source of all cosmic manifestations; indeed, all creation takes place within the Lord. Since the three modes of material nature are under the superior control of the Lord, material objects helplessly undergo creation and annihilation within the universal shell by the will of the Lord. The term avyakta indicates the Lord\u2019s subtle spiritual form, which exists alone before the material creation. The Lord\u2019s original form, being spiritual, does not undergo birth, transformation or death. It is eternal. In the course of time, the Lord\u2019s material potencies are divided and manifest as bodies, bodily paraphernalia, sense objects, bodily expansions, false ego and false proprietorship. Thus the Lord expands His conscious living potency called j\u012bva-\u015bakti, which is manifest in innumerable material forms such as those of men, demigods, animals, and so on. From the example of the seeds sown in an agricultural field, we can understand that innumerable manifestations may arise from a single source. Similarly, although the Lord is one, He becomes manifest in innumerable forms through the expansion of His different potencies."

One\u2019s material life may appear to be blossoming, but ultimately there will appear the bitter fruits of old age, death and other catastrophes. Attachment to the material body, which is always inclined toward sense gratification, is the root cause of material existence, and it is therefore called sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-taru.

It produces five flavors and has eleven branches and a nest made by two birds. The tree is covered by three types of bark, gives two fruits and extends up to the sun. Those lusty after material enjoyment and dedicated to family life enjoy one of the tree\u2019s fruits, and swanlike men in the renounced order of life enjoy the other fruit. One who with the help of the bona fide spiritual masters can understand this tree to be a manifestation of the potency of the one Supreme Truth appearing in many forms actually knows the meaning of the Vedic literature.",
        "purport": " The two seeds of this tree are sinful and pious activities, and the hundreds of roots are the living entities\u2019 innumerable material desires, which chain them to material existence. The three lower trunks represent the three modes of material nature, and the five upper trunks represent the five gross material elements. The tree produces five flavors \u2014 sound, form, touch, taste and aroma \u2014 and has eleven branches \u2014 the five working senses, the five knowledge-acquiring senses and the mind. Two birds, namely the individual soul and the Supersoul, have made their nest in this tree, and the three types of bark are air, bile and mucus, the constituent elements of the body. The two fruits of this tree are happiness and distress. Those who are busy trying to enjoy the company of beautiful women, money and other luxurious aspects of illusion enjoy the fruit of unhappiness. One should remember that even in the heavenly planets there is anxiety and death. Those who have renounced material goals and taken to the path of spiritual enlightenment enjoy the fruit of happiness. One who takes the assistance of bona fide spiritual masters can understand that this elaborate tree is simply the manifestation of the external potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is ultimately one without a second. If one can see the Supreme Lord as the ultimate cause of everything, then his knowledge is perfect. Otherwise, if one is entangled in Vedic rituals or Vedic speculation without knowledge of the Supreme Lord, he has not achieved the perfection of life."

        "translation": "With steady intelligence you should develop unalloyed devotional service by careful worship of the spiritual master, and with the sharpened ax of transcendental knowledge you should cut off the subtle material covering of the soul. Upon realizing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, you should then give up that ax of analytic knowledge.",
        "purport": " Because Uddhava had achieved the perfection of personal association with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there was no need for him to maintain the mentality of a conditioned soul, and thus, as described here by the words sampadya c\u0101tm\u0101nam, Uddhava could personally serve the lotus feet of the Lord in the spiritual world. Indeed, Uddhava requested this opportunity at the beginning of this great conversation. As stated here, gur\u016bp\u0101sanayaika-bhakty\u0101: one can achieve pure devotional service by worshiping a bona fide spiritual master. It is not recommended here that one give up pure devotional service or one\u2019s spiritual master. Rather, it is clearly stated by the words vidy\u0101-ku\u1e6dh\u0101re\u1e47a that one should cultivate knowledge of the material world as described by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this chapter. One should fully understand that each and every aspect of the material creation is the expansion of the illusory potency of the Lord. Such knowledge works as a sharpened ax to cut down the roots of material existence. In this way, even the stubborn subtle body, created by the three modes of nature, is cut to pieces, and one becomes apramatta, or sane and cautious in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has clearly explained in this chapter that the cowherd damsels of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana were not interested in an analytical approach to life. They simply loved Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and could not think of anything else. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu taught that all His devotees should follow in the footsteps of the cowherd damsels of Vraja in order to develop the highest intensity of selfless love of Godhead. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has elaborately analyzed the nature of the material world so that the conditioned souls, who are trying to enjoy it, can cut down the tree of material existence with this knowledge. The words sampadya c\u0101tm\u0101nam indicate that a person with such knowledge has no further material existence, because he has already achieved the Personality of Godhead. Such a person should not loiter in the kingdom of m\u0101y\u0101, perpetually refining his understanding of the illusory creation. One who has accepted Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as everything may enjoy eternal bliss in the Lord\u2019s service. Yet even though he remains in this world, he has no more business with it and gives up the analytical procedures for negating it. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore tells Uddhava, tyaj\u0101stram: \u201cGive up the ax of analytic knowledge by which you have cut down your sense of proprietorship and residence in the material world.\u201d"
