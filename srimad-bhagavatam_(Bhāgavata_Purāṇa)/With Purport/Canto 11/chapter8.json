Similarly, happiness will also be experienced, even without one\u2019s seeking it. Therefore a person of intelligent discrimination does not make any endeavor to obtain such material happiness.",
        "purport": " One should not uselessly waste his life pursuing material sense gratification, because a specific quantity of material happiness will automatically come to one as a result of one\u2019s past and present fruitive activities. This lesson is learned from the ajagara, or python, who lies down and accepts for his maintenance whatever comes of its own accord. Remarkably, in both material heaven and hell happiness and unhappiness come automatically, due to our previous activities, although the proportions of happiness and unhappiness certainly vary. Either in heaven or in hell one may eat, drink, sleep and have sex life, but these activities, being based on the material body, are temporary and inconsequential. An intelligent person should see that even the best material situation is actually a punishment for previous unlawful activities executed outside the scope of loving devotional service to God. A conditioned soul undergoes great trouble to obtain a little happiness. After struggling in material life, which is full of hardship and hypocrisy, one may receive a little sense gratification, but this illusory pleasure in no way offsets the burden of suffering one must bear to obtain it. After all, a pretty hat is no cure for a homely face. If one really wants to solve life\u2019s problems, one should live simply and reserve the major portion of one\u2019s life for loving service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even those who do not serve God receive a certain standard of maintenance from Him; therefore we can just imagine the security the Lord affords to those who dedicate their lives to His devotional service. Unrefined fruitive workers foolishly worry only about the present life, whereas more pious karm\u012bs imprudently make elaborate arrangements for future material sense gratification, unaware that all such enjoyment is temporary. The real solution, however, is to understand that by pleasing the Personality of Godhead, who is the master of all senses and all desires, one can attain permanent happiness. Such knowledge easily solves the problems of life."

Being confident of his relationship with the Lord, he should not endeavor for his personal maintenance, knowing that the Lord is protecting him in all respects. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura states that the example of the python is given so that one will not uselessly waste his time in bodily maintenance. One should not think, however, that the purpose of life is to lie on the ground like a python or to make a show of starving the body. The example of the python should not encourage one to become completely inactive. One should rather become active in spiritual advancement and inactive in material sense gratification. If one becomes completely inactive, that is certainly nidr\u0101, or the darkness of ignorance, in which one remains asleep to his identity as an eternal servant of the Personality of Godhead. A transcendentalist is eager to execute his service to the Lord, and therefore he is grateful when the Lord provides material facilities for such service. Mere renunciation of the material world is phalgu-vair\u0101gya, or an immature stage of spiritual understanding. One must come to the stage of yukta-vair\u0101gya, engaging everything in the service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is our practical experience that a devotee absorbed in spreading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically receives all facilities for his personal maintenance."

        "translation": "One who has failed to control his senses immediately feels attraction upon seeing a woman\u2019s form, which is created by the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord. Indeed, when the woman speaks with enticing words, smiles coquettishly and moves her body sensuously, his mind is immediately captured, and thus he falls blindly into the darkness of material existence, just as the moth maddened by the fire rushes blindly into its flames.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b explains in this regard that just as a moth is killed by its attraction to the form of fire, similarly a bee can easily be killed by exploiting its attraction to the fragrance of flowers. Furthermore, hunters may trap and kill an elephant by exploiting its sensuous desire to touch a captive female elephant and may also kill a deer by attracting it with the sounds of their horns; and a fish is killed by its desire to taste the bait on a hook. Thus, one who desires to learn detachment from material illusion should accept these five helpless creatures as guru and learn the needful. Certainly one who is lusty to enjoy the illusory form of woman will be quickly buried in material illusion. Of the five types of fatal attraction involving material sense objects, the lesson of r\u016bpa, or form, is illustrated in this verse."

        "translation": "A foolish person with no intelligent discrimination is immediately aroused at the sight of a lusty woman beautifully decorated with golden ornaments, fine clothing and other cosmetic features. Being eager for sense gratification, such a fool loses all intelligence and is destroyed just like the moth who rushes into the blazing fire.",
        "purport": " Actually, women have the power to attract men through all of the material senses. Men become lusty by seeing the body of a woman, by smelling her fragrance, by hearing her voice, by tasting her lips and by touching her body. However, the foolish relationship based on material sex attraction begins by seeing, and thus r\u016bpa, or form, is very prominent in the process of ruining one\u2019s intelligence. This fact has been exploited in modern times by huge pornography industries, which prey on unfortunate men and women. The example of the foolish moth rushing into the fire and destroying itself is most appropriate in this regard, for one who becomes addicted to the momentary pleasure of sex indulgence certainly loses his power to understand the spiritual reality behind dull matter. A lusty person becomes blind and foolish through sex indulgence, and his soul is lost in the fire of sense gratification. This whole disaster can be avoided by taking seriously to the process of chanting the holy names of the Lord: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and His empowered representatives such as \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da have created a movement to save people from the dungeon of material life, and we should all seriously take advantage of this opportunity."

        "purport": " Sometimes a honeybee is attracted by the extraordinary aroma of a particular lotus flower and lingers there, neglecting his usual activity of flying from flower to flower. Unfortunately, at sunset the lotus flower closes, and thus the infatuated honeybee is trapped. Similarly, a sanny\u0101s\u012b or brahmac\u0101r\u012b may discover that excellent foodstuff is available at a particular house, and therefore, instead of wandering from place to place, he may become a veritable resident of such a well-fed household. Thus he will become bewildered by the illusion of family life and fall down from the platform of renunciation. Also, if a mendicant takes unfair advantage of the Vedic custom of charity and takes too often from a single family, the resentment he causes will disturb the social order. An ideal sage should, like the honeybee, travel from place to place, but he must be careful not to become a chubby bee by going to many houses and eating sumptuously at each house. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, such a chubby bee will undoubtedly become entangled in the network of m\u0101y\u0101. No one should be overly attached to the gratification of his tongue, because this will lead to an overstuffed belly and then uncontrollable lust. In conclusion, one should not endeavor very much for material sense gratification but should instead endeavor strenuously to spread the glories of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the proper use of human energy."

A honeybee does not waste its time trying to carry away an entire bush or garden, but rather takes the essential nectar. We may thus study the difference between the honeybee and the ass, who carries heavy loads. Education does not mean to become an intellectual ass carrying heavy loads of useless knowledge; rather, one should accept the essential knowledge that leads to an eternal life of bliss and understanding. At the present time people generally have a sectarian concept of religion, and yet there is no scientific understanding of the Absolute Truth. Such complacent, dogmatic, sectarian religionists can certainly learn something from the example of the honeybee given in this verse."

One who is interested in making spiritual progress should avoid such a situation; however, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura points out that for the purpose of spreading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one may accumulate an unlimited amount of material opulence. This is called yukta-vair\u0101gya, or using everything in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A saintly person who is unable to work in Lord Caitanya\u2019s mission should practice austerities and collect only what he can hold in his hands and belly.

In fact, without acquiring material opulence, how is it possible to spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement all over the world? But if one tries to personally enjoy the funds or facilities acquired for the missionary activities of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, he commits the greatest offense. Therefore, even in the name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one should collect only what he can immediately engage in practical devotional service; otherwise one will fall down to the platform of ordinary greediness."

The lesson to be learned from the elephant is that the desire to relish the touch sensation is certainly the cause of ruining one\u2019s life. An intelligent person, noting the elephant\u2019s great propensity to sport with the she-elephant, will take this excellent example to heart. Therefore, somehow or other one should avoid being cheated by allurement to the sensuous form of woman. One should not allow one\u2019s mind to be lost in lusty dreams of sex pleasure. There are various types of sense gratification to be enjoyed between men and women, including speaking, contemplating, touching, sexual intercourse, etc., and all of these constitute the network of illusion by which one is helplessly bound like an animal. Somehow or other one should remain aloof from sense gratification in the form of sex pleasure; otherwise, there is no possibility of understanding the spiritual world."

No matter how carefully one hides his hard-earned wealth or tries to protect it, there are those who are expert in detecting the whereabouts of valuable things, and they will steal it.",
        "purport": " One may argue that a wealthy man may conceal his money so expertly, by investing it in banks, stocks, properties, and so on, that there is no danger of theft. Only foolish people actually hide money by burying it in the ground or placing it under a mattress. But despite the fact that the majority of the world\u2019s wealth has been accumulated in highly developed capitalistic countries, these countries are being severely challenged by many enemies who threaten at any moment to overrun the capitalists and steal their wealth. Similarly, we often find that the children of wealthy people are kidnapped, and then their parents must pay huge ransoms. Sometimes the parents themselves may also be kidnapped. Furthermore, there are so-called investment counselors who are expert in stealing the money of rich people; and in the modern age governments have also become expert in stealing money by taxation. Thus, the word artha-vit indicates one who by hook or by crook is expert in stealing the hard-earned wealth of other people. The bees work frantically to produce honey, but they will not enjoy their honey. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states, m\u1e5btyu\u1e25 sarva-hara\u015b c\u0101ham: \u201cI will come as death personified and steal everything.\u201d (Bg. 10.34) Somehow or other one\u2019s hard-earned material opulence will be stolen, and therefore, as mentioned in this verse, one should not work uselessly like the foolish honeybee."

If the householders enjoy such foodstuffs without first offering them in charity to the mendicants, such neglectful householders must undergo the lunar fast called c\u0101ndr\u0101ya\u1e47am.\u201d In family life one must overcome the natural tendency toward selfishness by giving abundant charity. Modern society foolishly does not observe such Vedic injunctions, and as a result the world has become overrun by envious g\u1e5bha-medh\u012bs, or persons wholly and solely dedicated to personal gratification in family life. Therefore, the whole world is seized in an uncontrollable spasm of violence and suffering. If one wants to live peacefully one must follow the Vedic injunctions regulating family life.

A thoughtful person should humbly take instruction from the deer, who is doomed by attraction to musical sense gratification."

But even if one eats only the foods authorized in the Vedas, there is still danger. One may eat too sumptuously and then the artificially stuffed belly will create pressure on the sexual organs. Thus one will fall down into the lower modes of nature and commit sinful activities that lead to the death of one\u2019s spiritual life. From the fish one should carefully learn the real dangers involved in gratifying the tongue."

        "purport": " In South America there is a saying that when the belly is full the heart is content. Thus, one who is eating sumptuously is jolly, and if one is deprived of proper food one\u2019s appetite becomes even more voracious. An intelligent person, however, does not fall under the control of the tongue, but rather tries to make progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. By accepting the remnants of food offered to the Lord (pras\u0101dam), one gradually purifies the heart and automatically becomes simple and austere. In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura states that the business of the tongue is to gratify itself with the varieties of flavor, but by wandering in the twelve holy forests of Vraja-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala (V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana), one can be freed from the twelve flavors of material sense gratification. The five principal divisions of material relationships are neutral admiration, servitude, friendship, parental affection and conjugal love; the seven subordinate features of material relationships are material humor, astonishment, chivalry, compassion, anger, dread and ghastliness. Originally, these twelve rasas, or flavors of relationships, are exchanged between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity in the spiritual world; and by wandering in the twelve forests of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana one can respiritualize the twelve flavors of personal existence. Thus one will become a liberated soul, free from all material desires. If one artificially tries to give up sense gratification, especially that of the tongue, the attempt will be a failure, and in fact one\u2019s desire for sense gratification will increase as a result of artificial deprivation. Only by experiencing real, spiritual pleasure in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can one give up material desires."

        "translation": "Although one may conquer all of the other senses, as long as the tongue is not conquered it cannot be said that one has controlled his senses. However, if one is able to control the tongue, then one is understood to be in full control of all the senses.",
        "purport": " By eating, one gives energy and activity to all of the senses, and thus if the tongue is uncontrolled all of the senses will be dragged down to the material platform of existence. Therefore, by all means one must control the tongue. If one fasts, then all of the other senses become weak and lose their potency. The tongue, however, becomes more greedy to taste delicious preparations, and when one finally indulges the tongue, all of the senses quickly go out of control. Therefore, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura advises that one accept mah\u0101-pras\u0101dam, or the remnants of the Lord\u2019s food, in a moderate proportion. Since the tongue\u2019s function is also to vibrate, one should vibrate the glorious holy name of the Supreme Lord and taste the ecstasy of pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, rasa-varja\u1e41 raso\u00a0\u2019py asya para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate: only by the higher taste of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can one give up the deadly lower taste that keeps one imprisoned in material bondage. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura states that as long as one\u2019s intelligence is materially covered, one cannot understand the pleasure of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Trying to enjoy without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the living entity leaves the abode of the Supreme Lord, called Vrajabh\u016bmi, and comes down into the material world, where he quickly loses control of his senses. One becomes particularly victimized by the tongue, belly and genitals, which exert intolerable pressure on the conditioned soul. These desires subside, however, when one reestablishes one\u2019s blissful relationship with the Lord, who is actually the reservoir of all pleasure. One who is attached to the taste of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically follows all of the rules and regulations of religious life due to spontaneous attraction to vi\u015buddha-sattva, or the mode of pure goodness. Without such spontaneous attraction, one is certainly bewildered by the pushing of the material senses. Even the beginning stage of devotional service, called s\u0101dhana-bhakti (regulatory practice), is so powerful that it brings one to the platform of anartha-niv\u1e5btti, where one becomes free from unwanted sinful habits and gains relief from the pressure of the tongue, belly and genitals. Thus one is delivered from the bondage of material addiction and can no longer be cheated by the allurements of the material energy. As it is said, all that glitters is not gold. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura recommends that we consider the following song written by his father, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura: \u201cO Lord, this material body is a lump of ignorance, and the senses are a network of paths to death. Somehow, we have fallen into this ocean of material sense enjoyment, and of all the senses the tongue is most voracious and uncontrollable; it is very difficult to conquer the tongue in this world. But You, dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are very kind to us and have given us such nice pras\u0101dam, just to control the tongue. Now we take this pras\u0101dam to our full satisfaction and glorify Their Lordships \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and in love call for the help of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nity\u0101nanda.\u201d"

The words k\u0101nt\u0101d asata\u1e25 indicate that she was freely selling herself without discrimination to the most ordinary and useless men, considering them to be \u201clovers.\u201d Thus she says, \u201cI was a great fool.\u201d The word b\u0101li\u015b\u0101 means \u201cone who has a childish mentality, without practical experience of right and wrong.\u201d"

Since Pi\u1e45gal\u0101 is now glorifying the Personality of Godhead for His mercy in awarding salvation, the following question might arise: Is she worshiping the Lord out of love, or is she merely a salvationist desiring liberation from material existence? In answer it may be said that in her K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious situation she is already liberated, even though remaining in this world. Her program will now be simply to render loving service to the Personality of Godhead without any personal desire, including that of salvation."
