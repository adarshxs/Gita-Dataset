        "purport": " Pratiloma indicates the combination of a superior woman with an inferior man. For example, the vaidehaka community consists of those born of a \u015b\u016bdra father and br\u0101hma\u1e47a mother, whereas the s\u016btas are those born from a k\u1e63atriya father and a br\u0101hma\u1e47a mother or from a \u015b\u016bdra father and k\u1e63atriya mother. Anuloma indicates those born from a superior father and inferior mother. The m\u016brdh\u0101vasikta are those born of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a father and k\u1e63atriya mother. Amba\u1e63\u1e6dhas are those born from a br\u0101hma\u1e47a father and vai\u015bya mother, and they often become medical men. Kara\u1e47a indicates those born of a vai\u015bya father and \u015b\u016bdra mother or of a k\u1e63atriya father and vai\u015bya mother. That such mixing of castes is not very much appreciated in the Vedic culture is demonstrated in the First Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Arjuna was very worried that the death of so many k\u1e63atriyas on the battlefield would lead to the mixing of superior women with inferior men, and on those grounds he objected to fighting. In any case, the entire Vedic social system is based on distinguishing between piety and sin, and \u015ar\u012b Uddhava is encouraging the Lord to explain more elaborately His statement that one should transcend both piety and sin."

        "purport": " One might argue that while human beings are certainly prone to ignorance, the elevated forefathers and demigods are considered to be all-knowing within universal affairs. If such superior beings would communicate with the earth, then everyone could bypass Vedic knowledge in achieving his personal desire. This concept is denied here by the words veda\u015b cak\u1e63u\u1e25. Even the demigods and forefathers have at best an ambiguous conception of supreme liberation, and even in material affairs they are subject to personal frustration. Although the demigods are all-powerful in awarding material benedictions to inferior species such as human beings, they are sometimes thwarted in their personal programs of sense gratification. A rich businessman, for example, may have no difficulty paying the insignificant salary of one of his innumerable workers, but the same wealthy man may be completely frustrated in his dealings with his own family and friends and may also be defeated in his attempts to expand his fortune by further investments. Although a rich man appears to be all-powerful to his subordinate workers, he must personally struggle to fulfill his personal desires. Similarly, the demigods and forefathers encounter many difficulties in maintaining and expanding their celestial standard of living. They must therefore constantly take shelter of superior Vedic knowledge. Even in the administration of cosmic affairs, they strictly follow the guidelines of the Vedas, which are the laws of God. If such fabulous entities as demigods must take shelter of the Vedas, we can just imagine the position of human beings, who are frustrated at virtually every step of their lives. Every human being should accept Vedic knowledge as the highest evidence in material and spiritual affairs. Uddhava points out to the Lord that if one accepts the authority of Vedic knowledge, it is seemingly impossible to reject the concept of material piety and sin. Thus Uddhava persists in examining the Lord\u2019s controversial statement at the end of the last chapter."

        "purport": " In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states, vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: \u201cBy all the Vedas I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of Ved\u0101nta, and I know the Veda as it is.\u201d Vedic knowledge emanates from the breathing of the Personality of Godhead; therefore, whatever Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speaks is Veda, or perfect knowledge. The Vedic literatures are full of descriptions of piety and sin, but Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statement that one should transcend piety and sin is also to be understood as Vedic knowledge. \u015ar\u012b Uddhava has understood this point and therefore requests Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to clear up an apparent contradiction. Ultimately, the material world gives the living entities a chance to satisfy their perverted desires and at the same time gradually achieve the liberation of going back home, back to Godhead. Thus material piety must be considered a means and never an absolute end, since the material world itself is not absolute, being temporary and limited. The Personality of Godhead is Himself the reservoir of all virtue and goodness. Those persons and activities that please the Lord are to be considered virtuous, and those that displease Him are to be considered sinful. There cannot be any other permanent definition of these terms. If one becomes a mundane moralist, forgetting the Supreme Lord, one\u2019s position is certainly imperfect, and one will not achieve the ultimate goal of piety, going back home, back to Godhead. On the other hand, there is great fear among moralists that if the distinction between piety and sin is minimized, people will commit many atrocities in the name of God. In the modern world there is no clear understanding of spiritual authority, and moral men consider any appeal to transcend morality to be an invitation to fanaticism, anarchy, violence and corruption. Thus they regard material moral principles as more important than directly trying to please God. Because this point is controversial, Uddhava is anxiously requesting the Lord to give a clear explanation."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Uddhava, because I desire that human beings may achieve perfection, I have presented three paths of advancement \u2014 the path of knowledge, the path of work and the path of devotion. Besides these three there is absolutely no other means of elevation.",
        "purport": " Ultimately, the goal of philosophical speculation, pious regulated work and devotional service is the same \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As stated by the Lord in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.11): \u201cAll of them \u2014 as they surrender unto Me \u2014 I reward accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101.\u201d Although all authorized processes of human perfection ultimately lead to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or love of God, various performers have specific propensities and qualifications and thus gravitate to different methods of self-realization. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here describes the three authorized processes together in order to emphasize that their ultimate goal is one. At the same time, philosophical speculation and regulated pious work can never be considered equal to pure love of Godhead, as the Lord has elaborately clarified in the previous chapters. The word traya\u1e25, or \u201cthree,\u201d indicates that despite their ultimate oneness of purpose, the three paths display diversity in progress and achievement. One cannot achieve the same result by mere speculation or piety that one achieves by directly surrendering to the Personality of Godhead, depending completely on His mercy and friendship. The word karma here indicates work dedicated to the Personality of Godhead. As described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9): \u201cWork done as a sacrifice for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has to be performed; otherwise work binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunt\u012b, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage.\u201d In the process of j\u00f1\u0101na, one seeks impersonal liberation by merging into the glaring effulgence of the Personality of Godhead. Such liberation is considered hellish by the devotees, because by merging one loses all awareness of the supreme blissful feature of the Lord as Bhagav\u0101n, the supreme person. The performers of karma, or regulated work, seek the three aspects of human progress other than liberation \u2014 namely religiosity, economic development and sense gratification. The fruitive workers think that by exhausting each of their innumerable material desires they will gradually come out of the dark tunnel of material existence into the clear light of spiritual liberation. This process is very dangerous and uncertain, because not only is there virtually no limit to material desires, but even a slight flaw in the process of regulated work constitutes sin and throws one off the path of progressive life. The devotees directly aim for love of Godhead and are therefore most pleasing to the Supreme Lord. In any case, all three divisions of Vedic elevation depend completely on the mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One cannot progress along any one of these paths without the blessings of the Lord. Other Vedic processes, such as austerity, charity and so forth, are included within the three primary divisions described here."

There are many symptoms by which one can recognize an advanced devotee of the Lord. In the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.7) it is stated: One who is actually engaged in advanced devotional service immediately develops both clear knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and detachment from nondevotional activities. One who is not situated on this platform must comply with the ordinary injunctions of Vedic literature or risk becoming inimical to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The devotee thus becomes fearless by meditating on the Lord\u2019s promise of protection. Those, however, who are materially attached are frightened by the prospect of full surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thereby revealing their inimical mentality toward the Lord."

Both results are certainly superior to ordinary, fruitive activities, by which one tries to enjoy much the same things that animals do. If one\u2019s devotional service is mixed with a tendency toward fruitive activities or mental speculation, then one may achieve the neutral stage of love of Godhead, whereas those who are inclined to serve only Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advance to the higher stages of love of Godhead in servitude, friendship, parental love and the conjugal relationship."

A learned transcendentalist withholds and supplies sense objects so that the mind and senses remain fully controlled, just as the horseman sometimes pulls sharply on the reins and sometimes allows the horse to run freely. The rider never forgets his actual goal or destination, and eventually places the horse on the right path. Similarly, a learned transcendentalist, even though sometimes allowing the senses to act, never forgets the goal of self-realization, nor does he allow the senses to engage in sinful activity. Excessive austerity or restriction may result in great mental disturbance, just as pulling excessively on the reins of a horse may cause the horse to rear up against the rider. The path of self-realization depends upon clear intelligence, and the easiest way to acquire such expertise is surrender to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): One may not be a great scholar or spiritual intellect, but if one is sincerely engaged in loving service to the Lord without personal envy or personal motivation the Lord will reveal from within the heart the methodology required to control the mind.

The material mind may be attracted to sex; therefore by spiritual intelligence one should scrutinize the temporary nature of one\u2019s own body and the body that has artificially become the object of one\u2019s material lust. One may apply this rigid analysis to all material bodies, from the fantastic cosmic body of Lord Brahm\u0101 down to that of the most insignificant germ.

Premeditated exploitation of the mercy of the Lord can never be excused. Significantly, the Lord forbids any extraneous purificatory rites, since the transcendental yoga systems are themselves the most purifying processes, especially bhakti-yoga. If one gives up one\u2019s regular prescribed duties to perform a special ritual or penance, trying to purify a sinful reaction, then one will be guilty of the additional fault of giving up one\u2019s prescribed duties. One should pick oneself up from an accidental falldown and go on vigorously with one\u2019s prescribed duties in life without being unnecessarily discouraged. One should certainly lament and feel ashamed, or there will be no purification. However, if one becomes overly depressed at an accidental falldown one will not have the enthusiasm to go on to perfection. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also states in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.30): \u201cEven if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service, he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.\u201d The most important point is that one should be properly engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, for then the Lord will excuse and purify an accidental falldown. One should, however, be most cautious to avoid such an unhappy event."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here explains more clearly that those persons directly engaged in self-realization either through j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga or bhakti-yoga need not give up their regular duties and perform special penances to atone for an accidental falldown. The actual purpose of Vedic literature is to direct one back home, back to Godhead, and not to encourage material sense gratification. Although the Vedas recommend innumerable rituals for promotion to heavenly planets and enjoyment of all varieties of material opulence, such materialistic rewards are meant only to engage materialistic people, who otherwise would become demoniac. To purify an accidental falldown, one who is engaged in transcendental realization need not adopt any procedure beyond his own spiritual practice. The words sa\u1e45g\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 ty\u0101janecchay\u0101 indicate that one should not practice K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or self-realization superficially or casually; rather, one should sincerely and earnestly desire freedom from one\u2019s past sinful life. Similarly, the words y\u0101 ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 indicate that one must constantly practice K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Thus, essential piety is to give up material sense gratification and engage in the loving service of the Lord. One who engages his senses, mind and intelligence twenty-four hours a day in the Lord\u2019s service is the most pious person, and the Lord personally protects such a surrendered soul."

Even though he is sometimes engaged in sense enjoyment, My devotee knows that all sense gratification leads to a miserable result, and he sincerely repents such activities.",
        "purport": " The beginning stage of pure devotional service is described here by the Lord. A sincere devotee has practically seen that all material activities lead only to sense gratification and all sense gratification leads only to misery. Thus a devotee\u2019s sincere desire is to engage twenty-four hours a day in the loving service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without any personal motivation. The devotee sincerely desires to be established in his constitutional position as the Lord\u2019s eternal servitor, and he prays to the Lord to elevate him to this exalted position. The word an\u012b\u015bvara indicates that because of one\u2019s past sinful activities and bad habits one may not immediately be able to completely extinguish the enjoying spirit. The Lord here encourages such a devotee not to be overly depressed or morose but to remain enthusiastic and to go on with his loving service. The word nirvi\u1e47\u1e47a indicates that a sincere devotee, although somewhat entangled in the remnants of sense gratification, is completely disgusted with material life and under no circumstances willingly commits sinful activities. In fact, he avoids every kind of materialistic activity. The word k\u0101m\u0101n basically refers to sex attraction and its by-products in the form of children, home and so forth. Within the material world, the sex impulse is so strong that even a sincere candidate in the loving service of the Lord may sometimes be disturbed by sex attraction or by lingering sentiments for wife and children. A pure devotee certainly feels spiritual affection for all living entities, including the so-called wife and children, but he knows that material bodily attraction leads to no good, for it simply entangles one and one\u2019s so-called relatives in a miserable chain reaction of fruitive activities. The word d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-ni\u015bcaya (\u201csteadfast conviction\u201d) indicates that in any circumstance a devotee is completely determined to go on with his prescribed duties for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he thinks, \u201cBy my previous shameful life my heart is polluted with many illusory attachments. Personally I have no power to stop them. Only Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within my heart can remove such inauspicious contamination. But whether the Lord removes such attachments immediately or lets me go on being afflicted by them, I will never give up my devotional service to Him. Even if the Lord places millions of obstacles in my path, and even if because of my offenses I go to hell, I will never for a moment stop serving Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. I am not interested in mental speculation and fruitive activities; even if Lord Brahm\u0101 personally comes before me offering such engagements, I will not be even slightly interested. Although I am attached to material things I can see very clearly that they lead to no good because they simply give me trouble and disturb my devotional service to the Lord. Therefore, I sincerely repent my foolish attachments to so many material things, and I am patiently awaiting Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy.\u201d The word pr\u012bta indicates that a devotee feels exactly like the son or subject of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is very attached to his relationship with the Lord. Therefore, although sincerely lamenting occasional lapses into sense enjoyment, he never gives up his enthusiasm to serve Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If a devotee becomes too morose or discouraged in devotional service, he may drift into an impersonal consciousness or give up his devotional service to the Lord. Therefore, the Lord here advises that although one should sincerely repent, he should not become chronically depressed. One should understand that because of his past sins he must occasionally suffer disturbances from the material mind and senses, but one should not therefore become a devotee of detachment, as do the speculative philosophers. Although one may desire detachment to purify one\u2019s devotional service to the Lord, if one becomes more concerned with renunciation than with acting for the pleasure of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is misunderstanding the position of loving devotional service. Faith in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so powerful that in due course of time it will automatically award detachment and perfect knowledge. If one gives up Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the central object of one\u2019s worship and concentrates more on knowledge and detachment, one will become deviated from one\u2019s progress in going back home, back to Godhead. A sincere devotee of the Lord must be sincerely convinced that simply by the strength of devotional service and the mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he will achieve everything auspicious in life. One must believe that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all-merciful and that He is the only real goal of one\u2019s life. Such determined faith combined with a sincere desire to give up sense enjoyment will carry one past the obstacles of this world. The words j\u0101ta-\u015braddha\u1e25 mat-kath\u0101su are most significant here. By faithful hearing of the mercy and glories of the Lord one will gradually be freed from all material desire and clearly see at every moment the utter frustration of sense gratification. Chanting the glories of the Lord with firm faith and conviction is a tremendously powerful spiritual process that enables one to give up all material association. There is actually nothing inauspicious in the devotional service of the Lord. Occasional difficulties experienced by a devotee are due to his previous material activities. On the other hand, the endeavor for sense gratification is completely inauspicious. Thus sense gratification and devotional service are directly opposed to each other. In all circumstances one should therefore remain the Lord\u2019s sincere servant, always believing in His mercy. Then one will certainly go back home, back to Godhead."

One thus becomes absorbed in material sex pleasure, dreaming of innumerable combinations of male and female bodies. A person intoxicated by sex attraction cannot understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all pleasure and the supreme enjoyer. When a devotee achieves steadiness in devotional service, feeling transcendental pleasure at every moment in the execution of his loving service to the Lord, the knot of false identification is pierced and all his misgivings are cut to pieces. In illusion we imagine that the living entity cannot be fully satisfied without material sense gratification and speculative doubting of the Absolute Truth. Materialistic persons consider sense enjoyment and speculative doubting to be essential for civilized life. A pure devotee, however, realizes that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an unlimited ocean of happiness and the personification of all knowledge. This realization of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a completely eradicates the twin tendencies of sense gratification and mental speculation. Thus the chain of fruitive activities, or karma, automatically collapses, just as a fire collapses and goes out when its fuel is removed. Advanced devotional service automatically awards one liberation from material bondage, as confirmed by Lord Kapila: jarayaty \u0101\u015bu y\u0101 ko\u015ba\u1e41 nig\u012br\u1e47am analo yath\u0101. \u201cBhakti, devotional service, dissolves the subtle body of the living entity without separate effort, just as fire in the stomach digests all that we eat.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.25.33) \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da states in his purport to this verse, \u201cA devotee does not have to try separately to attain liberation. That very service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the process of liberation, because to engage oneself in the service of the Lord is to liberate oneself from material entanglement. \u015ar\u012b Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura explained this position very nicely. He said, \u2018If I have unflinching devotion unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, then mukti, or liberation, serves me as my maidservant. Mukti the maidservant is always ready to do whatever I ask.\u2019 For a devotee, liberation is no problem at all. Liberation takes place without separate endeavor.\u201d"

Devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being itself the supreme transcendental process, never depends upon the secondary methods involving the cultivation of knowledge and renunciation. By chanting and hearing the glories of the Personality of Godhead a devotee automatically realizes all knowledge, and as the devotee\u2019s attachment to the Lord increases, he automatically gives up attachment for the inferior material nature. The Lord has explicitly declared in the previous verses that a devotee should not try to solve his lingering problems by means other than devotional service. Although a sincere devotee has surrendered heart and soul in loving service to the Lord, there may be lingering material attachments that prevent the devotee from perfectly realizing transcendental knowledge. Devotional service, however, will automatically eradicate such lingering attachments in due course of time. If the devotee tries to purify himself through cultivation of knowledge and renunciation which fall outside the scope of devotional service, there is danger of his being deviated from the Lord\u2019s lotus feet and falling down completely from the transcendental path. One who endeavors for purification outside the loving service of the Lord has not actually understood the transcendental potency of bhakti-yoga and does not appreciate the extent of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy. Within this world one\u2019s heart is bound by sex attraction, which disturbs one\u2019s meditation on the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Intoxicated by contact with women, the conditioned soul becomes artificially proud and forgets his loving servitude to the Lord. Through determined cultivation of knowledge and detachment, a conditioned soul may try to purify himself without the mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but such false pride is to be given up, just as one must give up the false pride of material attraction. When pure devotional service to the Lord is available to a conditioned soul, attraction to other processes is certainly a deviation in his devotional career. Material desire stubbornly residing within the heart can be vanquished by taking full shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without false confidence in one\u2019s own cultivation of knowledge and renunciation, one should depend fully on the mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and at the same time strictly follow the rules and regulations of bhakti-yoga, as instructed by the Lord Himself."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here reveals the transcendental glories of devotional service to the Lord. Although pure devotees are desireless, desiring only the Lord\u2019s service, sometimes a great devotee may desire the Lord\u2019s benediction to facilitate his loving service. In the Sixth Canto of the Bh\u0101gavatam we find that \u015ar\u012b Citraketu, a great devotee of the Lord, desired promotion to heaven so that accompanied by the most attractive ladies of the Vidy\u0101dhara planet he could beautifully chant the glories of the Lord. Similarly, \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the great narrator of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, desiring to avoid entanglement in the illusory potency of the Lord, would not come out of his mother\u2019s womb. In other words, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b desired apavargam, or liberation from m\u0101y\u0101, so that his devotional service would not be disturbed. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally sent the illusory energy far away so that \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b would come out of his mother\u2019s womb. Because of intense loving desire to serve the lotus feet of the Lord, a devotee may also desire promotion to the spiritual world. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a devotee, having given up the independent cultivation of knowledge and detachment, may have firm faith in the devotional service of the Lord and yet remain slightly attached to the fruits of such activities. By expert fruitive activities one gains residence in material heaven, and by cultivation of detachment one is relieved of all bodily distress. If Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a detects within a devotee\u2019s heart the desire for such benedictions, the Lord can easily award them to His devotee. The word itarai\u1e25 in this verse indicates visiting holy places, accepting religious vows and so forth. Several auspicious processes of elevation are mentioned in the verse preceding this, but all the auspicious results of these processes are easily achieved by loving service to the Lord. Thus all devotees of the Lord, in whatever stage of advancement, should dedicate their energy exclusively to the Lord\u2019s service, as affirmed in the Second Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam by \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b: \u201cA person who has broader intelligence, whether he be full of all material desire, without any material desire or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.3.10)"

A pure devotee automatically gains an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in the Lord\u2019s personal abode and thus considers mere liberation without the loving service of the Lord to be most abominable. One who chants Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s holy name or superficially serves the Lord with the motive of achieving impersonal liberation or material sense gratification cannot be considered a transcendental devotee of the Lord. As long as one desires mundane religiosity, economic development, sense gratification or liberation, one cannot achieve the platform of sam\u0101dhi, or perfect self-realization. Every living entity is actually the eternal servant of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and is constitutionally meant to engage in the loving service of the Lord without personal desire. This pure and supreme status of life is described in this verse by the Lord Himself."

        "purport": " The words buddhe\u1e25 param indicate that the material modes of nature cannot be found within a pure devotee absorbed in the transcendental qualities of the Lord. In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly explains that a pure devotee is recognized by complete detachment from personal desire; therefore, a pure devotee constantly engaged in selfless service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may not always observe the innumerable details of Vedic rituals and regulations. Such occasional negligence is not to be considered a transgression. Similarly, observance of ordinary material piety does not constitute the ultimate qualification of a soul surrendered to God. Love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and absolute surrender to the Lord\u2019s will raise one immediately to the transcendental platform, where activities performed on the Lord\u2019s behalf are absolute, being an expression of God\u2019s will. Ordinary materialistic persons sometimes falsely claim this exalted status for their whimsical, immoral activities and cause a great disturbance in society. However, just as an ordinary person should not falsely claim the executive privileges of the personal assistants of a national leader, similarly, an ordinary conditioned soul may not foolishly claim that his immoral, whimsical or speculative activities are sheltered by divine right, being the will of God. One must actually be a pure devotee of the Lord, empowered by the Lord Himself and completely surrendered to the will of the Lord, before one may be accepted as transcendental to ordinary piety and sin. There are cases of highly elevated devotees who momentarily fell down from the saintly platform of devotional service. The Lord instructs in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.30): A momentary falldown by a sincere devotee of the Lord cannot change the Lord\u2019s feelings toward such a person. Even an ordinary father or mother quickly excuses a momentary transgression by their child. Just as children and parents enjoy mutual love, the Lord\u2019s surrendered servants enjoy a loving relationship with the Lord. An unpremeditated, accidental falldown is quickly excused by the Lord, and all members of society must share in the Lord\u2019s own feelings, excusing such a sincere devotee. An advanced devotee should not be branded as materialistic or sinful because of accidental falldown. A devotee immediately returns to the platform of saintly service and begs the Lord\u2019s forgiveness. However, one who permanently remains in a fallen condition can no longer be accepted as a highly elevated devotee of the Lord."
