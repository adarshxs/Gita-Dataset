Therefore, please tell us about the various pastimes Lord Hari has performed in the past, is performing now and will perform in this world in the future in His various incarnations.",
        "purport": " In this Fourth Chapter the son of Jayant\u012b, Drumila, will address King Nimi. The forty-eighth verse of the Third Chapter stated, m\u016brty\u0101bhimatay\u0101tmana\u1e25: \u201cOne should worship the particular form of the Lord most attractive to oneself.\u201d Similarly it was stated in the previous chapter, stavai\u1e25 stutv\u0101 named dharim: \u201cOne should bow down to Lord Hari after glorifying Him with prayers.\u201d Thus it is assumed that the worshiper has knowledge of the Supreme Lord\u2019s transcendental qualities and pastimes in order to execute the process of worship previously described. King Nimi, therefore, is eagerly inquiring about the various incarnations of the Supreme Lord so that he can ascertain which particular form of the Supreme Lord is most suitable for his personal worship. It is understood that King Nimi is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or devotee, who is trying to advance in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is important to note in this regard that the word abhimata-m\u016brti, meaning \u201cone\u2019s most desirable form,\u201d does not indicate that one may concoct a form of the Lord by one\u2019s own whim. Advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam. All the forms of the Supreme Lord are an\u0101dim, or eternal. Thus there is no question of concocting a form, because such a concoction would be \u0101di, or the origin of the concocted form. Abhimata-m\u016brti means that among the eternal forms of the Lord one should select that form which most inspires one\u2019s love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such love cannot be imitated, but it is automatically aroused when one follows the prescribed rules and regulations given by the bona fide spiritual master and submissively hears these descriptions of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

Even if a great genius could somehow or other, after a time-consuming endeavor, count all the particles of dust on the surface of the earth, such a genius could never count the attractive qualities of the Personality of Godhead, who is the reservoir of all potencies.",
        "purport": " In reply to King Nimi\u2019s request that the nava-yogendras describe all the qualities and pastimes of the Lord, \u015ar\u012b Drumila here explains that only the most foolish person would even attempt such a comprehensive description of the unlimited qualities and pastimes of the Personality of Godhead. Such foolish, childish persons, however, are far more advanced than ignorant materialistic scientists who actually try to describe all knowledge without even referring to the Personality of Godhead. In other words, although it is impossible to describe the Lord fully, foolish atheistic scientists attempt to describe all knowledge without even having reached the most preliminary knowledge of the Personality of Godhead. Such atheistic persons should be understood to be shortsighted and of very weak intelligence, despite their showy material achievements, which ultimately end in great suffering and destruction. It is said that Lord Anantadeva Himself, with His innumerable tongues, cannot even begin to vibrate completely the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example given in this verse is very nice. No human being can hope to count the number of particles on the surface of the earth; therefore no one should foolishly try to understand the Supreme Lord by his own tiny endeavor. One should submissively hear knowledge of God as it is spoken by God Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and thus one should gradually be elevated to the stage of hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. According to Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, by tasting a drop of seawater one can get a general idea of the flavor of the entire ocean. Similarly, by submissively hearing about the Personality of Godhead one can acquire a qualitative understanding of the Absolute Truth, although quantitatively one\u2019s knowledge can never be complete."

        "purport": " The words bh\u016btai\u1e25 pa\u00f1cabhi\u1e25 in this verse refer to the five gross material elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air and sky \u2014 which form the basic building blocks of the material world. When the conditioned living entity enters within these five elements, consciousness becomes manifest, along with the functions of the mind and intelligence. Unfortunately, the consciousness manifest under the modes of material nature is governed by aha\u1e45k\u0101ra, or false ego, in which the living entity wrongly considers himself the enjoyer of the material elements. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puru\u1e63ottama, enjoys His pure transcendental existence in the spiritual sky, the material elements are also meant for His enjoyment, through the process of yaj\u00f1a, or sacrifice. This material world is called Dev\u012b-dh\u0101ma, or the abode of the illusory energy of the Lord, M\u0101y\u0101dev\u012b. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 explains that the Supreme Person is not at all attracted to His inferior energy, m\u0101y\u0101, but when the material creation is used in the devotional service of the Lord, the Lord becomes attracted by the devotion and sacrifice of the living entities, and thus, indirectly, He is also the enjoyer of the material world. We should not think that the pastimes of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a as the Supersoul and creator of this universe are on a lower spiritual level than N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s eternal pastimes in the spiritual world. Were Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in any way to diminish His transcendental bliss and knowledge in His activities of material creation, He would have to be considered a conditioned soul, affected by contact with the illusory potency. But since Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is eternally aloof from the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, His activities as the Supersoul of this universe are exactly on the same transcendental level as His activities in the spiritual world. All the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are part and parcel of His unlimited spiritual pastimes."

Thus we should understand that independent of the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead we can neither work nor cultivate knowledge. By the mercy of the Personality of Godhead the conditioned soul acquires a material body, which is a perverted reflection of the unlimited spiritual body of the Lord. Thus the living entity engages in ignorant materialistic activities for society, friendship and love. But the entire program suddenly vanishes with the unforeseen dissolution of the material body. Similarly, our material knowledge is always subject to become null and void within an instant, since the material nature is itself constantly changing. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the prime mover behind the birth, maintenance and destruction of the universe. And the living entity should try to understand that Personality of Godhead who has given him so much facility for illusion. The Personality of Godhead actually wants the conditioned soul to surrender to Him and regain an eternal life of bliss and knowledge at the Lord\u2019s side. The conditioned soul should reason, \u201cIf the Lord is giving me so much facility to merge into ignorance, surely He will give even more facility to come out of this ignorance if I humbly follow His direction without foolish speculations.\u201d This verse describes Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the second phase of the puru\u1e63a incarnations of the Lord. This Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is glorified in the Puru\u1e63a-s\u016bkta prayers, expands Himself as the Supersoul to enter the heart of every living being.

The Lord is a person as much as we are, but He is unlimited. Still, a personal loving relationship exists between the tiny living entity and the unlimited Supreme Lord. In consideration of this personal relationship, bhakti-yoga is the only suitable process by which to come to the ultimate understanding of our constitutional position as eternal servants of the Supreme Lord."

        "translation": "In the beginning, the original Supreme Personality manifested the form of Brahm\u0101 through the material mode of passion in order to create this universe. The Lord manifested His form as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Lord of sacrifice and protector of the twice-born br\u0101hma\u1e47as and their religious duties, to maintain the universe. And when the universe is to be annihilated the same Supreme Lord employs the material mode of ignorance and manifests the form of Rudra. The created living beings are thus always subject to the forces of creation, maintenance and destruction.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead was described as \u0101di-kart\u0101, the original person responsible for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world. According to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, \u0101di-kart\u0101, or \u201cthe original doer,\u201d implies subsequent creators, maintainers and annihilators. Otherwise there would be no meaning to the word \u0101di, or \u201coriginal.\u201d Therefore this verse describes that the Absolute Truth expands Himself into the gu\u1e47\u0101vat\u0101ras, or incarnations who carry out the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the universe through the modes of passion, goodness and ignorance respectively. It is significant here that although this verse mentions creation through the material mode of passion and annihilation through the material mode of ignorance, it does not mention maintenance by Vi\u1e63\u1e47u through the material mode of goodness. That is because Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is vi\u015buddha-sattva, or existing on the platform of unlimited transcendental goodness. Although Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 are somewhat affected by their prescribed duties as superintendents of the modes of nature, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is vi\u015buddha-sattva, completely beyond contamination even by the material mode of goodness. As described in the Vedas, na tasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 kara\u1e47a\u1e41 ca vidyate: the Lord has no occupational duty. Whereas Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 are understood to be servants of the Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is completely transcendental. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, described in this verse as kratu-pati\u1e25, the Lord of sacrifice, is understood to have appeared in a previous age as the incarnation Suyaj\u00f1a, the son of Praj\u0101pati Ruci. Whereas Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva faithfully engage in service to the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Supreme Lord Himself, and therefore His activities of maintaining the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and religious principles, as mentioned in this verse (dvija-dharma-setu\u1e25), are not occupational duties but l\u012bl\u0101. So in addition to being a gu\u1e47\u0101vat\u0101ra, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is also a l\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101ra, according to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (\u015a\u0101nti-parva) describes the birth of Lord Brahm\u0101 from the lotus flower emanating from Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and the subsequent birth of Lord \u015aiva from the angry eyes of Lord Brahm\u0101. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, however, is the self-manifested Personality of Godhead who enters the material universe by His own internal potency, as stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.8.15): In conclusion, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the supreme controller whose personal form is full of eternal existence, knowledge and bliss, who is beginningless but is the beginning of everything, who is known as Govinda, and who is the original cause of all causes, as stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Still, that same eternal Lord manifests Himself as Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva in the sense that the primeval controllers Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva manifest the potency and supreme will of the Lord, although they themselves are not supreme."

Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u1e5a\u1e63i taught the devotional service of the Lord, by which material work ceases, and He Himself perfectly practiced this knowledge. He is living even today, His lotus feet served by the greatest of saintly persons.",
        "purport": " It is understood that Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u1e5a\u1e63i spoke transcendental knowledge to great saintly persons such as N\u0101rada Muni. On the basis of these teachings, N\u0101rada was able to describe nai\u1e63karmyam, or the devotional service of the Lord, which eradicates material work, as mentioned in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.3.8): tantra\u1e41 s\u0101tvatam \u0101ca\u1e63\u1e6da nai\u1e63karmya\u1e41 karma\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 yata\u1e25. The \u0101tma-svar\u016bpa, or eternal form of the living entity, is devotional service to the Personality of Godhead. But our perception of our eternal form is covered by a material concept of life, just as our normal understanding of our life is covered by a dream. Nai\u1e63karmyam, or the cessation of material work, is possible only by the devotional service of the Lord, as stated by N\u0101rada Muni himself: nai\u1e63karmyam apy acyuta-bh\u0101va-varjita\u1e41 na \u015bobhate j\u00f1\u0101nam ala\u1e41 nira\u00f1janam (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.12). The process of transforming ordinary karma into nai\u1e63karmya, or transcendental work, is summarized by \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da in his commentary on this verse spoken by N\u0101rada Muni. \u201cFruitive work, in which almost all people in general are engaged, is always painful either in the beginning or at the end. It can be fruitful only when made subservient to the devotional service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also it is confirmed that the result of such fruitive work may be offered for the service of the Lord, otherwise it leads to material bondage. The bona fide enjoyer of the fruitive work is the Personality of Godhead, and thus when it is engaged for the sense gratification of the living beings, it becomes an acute source of trouble.\u201d According to the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a (3.10), Dharma, the father of Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u1e5a\u1e63i, was born from the right breast of Brahm\u0101 and later married thirteen of the daughters of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a. The Lord Himself appeared from the womb of M\u016brtidev\u012b."

Cupid and the heavenly women, understanding their great offense, were trembling before Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in fear of receiving a powerful curse. But the Lord, exhibiting most sublime saintly behavior, reassured them by saying, m\u0101 bhai\u1e25 \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it\u201d \u2014 and actually offered them nice pras\u0101dam and articles of worship. \u201cIf you do not give Me the opportunity to act as host to the demigods and other respectable personalities,\u201d He said, \u201cwhat will be the use of My \u0101\u015brama? My \u0101\u015brama will be void without the opportunity to receive respectable personalities such as you.\u201d Similarly, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is establishing beautiful centers in all the major cities of the world. In some of these centers, such as those in Los Angeles, Bombay, London, Paris and Melbourne, the Society has established very gorgeous preaching \u0101\u015bramas. But the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas who live in these beautiful buildings feel that the buildings are void if guests do not come to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and chant His holy name. Thus, one may establish a beautiful \u0101\u015brama not for one\u2019s personal sense gratification but to execute K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness peacefully and encourage others to take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness also."

Those who offer the demigods their assigned shares in sacrificial performances encounter no such obstacles. But because You are the direct protector of Your devotee, he is able to step over the head of whatever obstacle the demigods place before him.",
        "purport": " The demigods, headed by K\u0101madeva, or Cupid, recognizing their offense at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, Nara-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u1e5a\u1e63i, here point out the insignificant position of the demigods in relation to the Supreme Lord. Just as a farmer must pay a specific percentage of his agricultural profit to the king or political head as tax money, all human beings must offer a percentage of their material wealth to the demigods in sacrifice. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, however, the Lord explains that the demigods are also His servants and it is He Himself who awards all benedictions, through the agency of the demigods. Mayaiva vihit\u0101n hi t\u0101n. Although a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or devotee of the Lord, has no need to worship the demigods, the demigods, being proud of their exalted material position, sometimes resent the exclusive devotion of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava to the Lord and thus try to cause the devotee to fall down, as described in this verse (sura-k\u1e5bt\u0101 bahavo\u00a0\u2019ntar\u0101y\u0101\u1e25). But the demigods here point out that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is directly the protector of His devotees. Therefore, so-called impediments become stimuli for further spiritual advancement for a sincere devotee. The demigods here state, \u201cWe thought, our dear Lord, that we could disturb Your consciousness by our foolish tricks. But by Your mercy even Your devotees pay little regard to us, so why should You take our foolish behavior seriously?\u201d The word yadi here is used to indicate the certainty that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always the protector of His surrendered devotees. Although there may be many obstacles on the path of the sincere devotee who is preaching the glories of the Lord, such obstacles increase the determination of the devotee. Therefore, according to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the continuous obstacles presented by the demigods form a kind of ladder or stairway upon which the devotee steadily progresses back to the kingdom of God. A similar verse appears in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.2.33): \u201cO M\u0101dhava, Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the goddess of fortune, if devotees completely in love with You sometimes fall from the path of devotion, they do not fall like nondevotees, for You still protect them. Thus they fearlessly traverse the heads of their opponents and continue to progress in devotional service.\u201d"

Those engaged in sense gratification are easily conquered by the demigods through various weapons such as hunger, thirst, sexual desire, lamentation for the past and vain hoping for the future. Such materialistic fools, infatuated with the material world, are easily controlled by the demigods, who are the ultimate supplying agents of sense gratification. But according to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, persons who attempt to subdue the desires of the material senses and thus avoid the control of the demigods without surrendering to the Supreme Lord are even more foolish than the sense gratifiers. Although crossing the ocean of sense gratification, those who perform severe penances without service to the Lord eventually drown in tiny puddles of anger. One who simply performs material penances does not actually purify his heart. By one\u2019s material determination one may restrict the activities of the senses although one\u2019s heart is still filled with material desires. The practical result of this is krodha, or anger. We have seen artificial performers of penance who have become very bitter and angry through denial of the senses. Being indifferent to the Supreme Lord, such persons do not achieve ultimate liberation, nor can they enjoy material sense gratification; rather, they become angry, and through cursing others or enjoying false pride they uselessly exhaust the results of their painful austerities. It is understood that when a yog\u012b curses he diminishes the mystic power he has accumulated. Thus, anger gives neither liberation nor material sense gratification but merely burns up all the results of material penances and austerities. Being useless, such anger is compared to a useless puddle found in a cow\u2019s hoofprint. Thus after crossing over the ocean of sense gratification the great yog\u012bs who are indifferent to the Supreme Lord drown in puddles of anger. Although the demigods admit that the devotees of the Lord actually conquer the miseries of material life, it is understood here that a similar result is not to be obtained by so-called yog\u012bs who are not interested in devotional service to the Supreme Lord."

        "translation": "To diminish the burden of the earth, the unborn Lord will take birth in the Yadu dynasty and perform feats impossible even for the demigods. Propounding speculative philosophy, the Lord, as Buddha, will bewilder the unworthy performers of Vedic sacrifices. And as Kalki the Lord will kill all the low-class men posing as rulers at the end of the Age of Kali.",
        "purport": " It is understood that in this verse the description of the Lord\u2019s appearance in the Yadu dynasty refers to the appearance of both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma, who together removed the demoniac rulers who were burdening the earth. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has pointed out that the description of the incarnations to deal with \u015b\u016bdr\u0101n, or low-class men, refers to both Buddha and Kalki. Those who misuse Vedic sacrifice to engage in gross sense gratification, such as the sinful killing of animals, are certainly in the category of \u015b\u016bdra, as are the so-called political leaders of Kali-yuga who perform many atrocities in the name of state management."
