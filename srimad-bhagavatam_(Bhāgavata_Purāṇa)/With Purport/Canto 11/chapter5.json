In the previous chapter it was explained that although the demigods place obstacles in the path of the Lord\u2019s devotees, by the mercy of the Supreme Lord the devotees are able to place their feet on the head of such obstacles and thus pass beyond them to the supreme destination. However, for the nondevotees there is no such facility. As soon as the conditioned soul becomes indifferent to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord, he is immediately attracted by the temporary varieties of matter and becomes a slave of inauspicious desires. Thus the conditioned soul, devoid of devotion for the Lord, completely forgets the transcendental bliss of the spiritual world, which is enjoyed in five transcendental rasas. Although the devotees are not overcome by the sense gratification offered by the demigods, the demigods themselves become absorbed in material form, taste and smell. And similarly, those who are nondevotees also become bound by material form, taste and other sense perceptions, such as the sensuous experience of sex life. Thus they remain hovering in a dreamlike state, imagining different types of material sense gratification, and forget their eternal relationship with the Personality of Godhead. Videhar\u0101ja Nimi now inquires from Camasa Muni about the goal attained by such bewildered persons."

Thus the four spiritual orders were also generated.",
        "purport": " Those who are not spontaneously attracted to the devotional service of the Lord can be gradually purified by observing the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system of four social orders and four spiritual orders. According to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are born of the mode of goodness, the k\u1e63atriyas of a combination of goodness and passion, the vai\u015byas of a combination of passion and ignorance and the \u015b\u016bdras of the mode of ignorance. Just as the four social orders are born from the face, arms, thighs and feet of the Lord\u2019s universal form, similarly the brahmac\u0101r\u012bs are generated from the heart of the Lord, the householder order from His loins, the v\u0101naprasthas from His chest and the sanny\u0101sa order from His head. A similar verse is found in the \u1e5ak-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (8.4.19), as well as the \u015aukla-yajur Veda (34.11) and the Atharva Veda (19.66): \u201cThe br\u0101hma\u1e47a appeared as His face, the king as His arms, the vai\u015bya as His thighs, and the \u015b\u016bdra was born from His feet.\u201d It is understood that pure devotional service to the Lord has already been described by two of the Yogendras, Drumila and \u0100virhotra. Camasa Muni now describes the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, because this system is meant to gradually purify those who are inimical to the Supreme Lord, bringing them back to their constitutional position of love of Godhead. Similarly, the vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa, or universal form of the Lord, is an imaginary form meant to help the gross materialists gradually understand the position of the Personality of Godhead. Since the foolish materialist cannot understand anything beyond matter, he is encouraged to see the entire universe as a personal form of the Supreme Lord\u2019s body. The impersonal conception of formlessness is a mere negation of temporary material variety without any concept of the Lord\u2019s spiritual potency. The impersonal view is another kind of material speculative conception. The Supreme Lord is full of spiritual potencies under the principal headings hl\u0101din\u012b, or unlimited bliss, sandhin\u012b, or eternal existence, and sa\u1e41vit, or omniscience. It is understood from this verse that the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma system generated from the universal form of the Lord is a program offered by the Lord to engage the conditioned souls in a complete social and religious system that gradually brings them back home, back to Godhead."

        "purport": " The words na bhajanti in this verse refer to those who out of ignorance do not worship the Supreme Lord, whereas the word avaj\u0101nanti refers to those who have actually been informed of the supreme position of the Lord but still show Him disrespect. It has already been described that the four spiritual and occupational orders of life are generated from the body of the Lord. In fact, the Supreme Lord is the source of everything, as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8): aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25. Those who foolishly do not inquire into the position of the Personality of Godhead, as well as those who disrespect the Lord in spite of having heard of His transcendental position, will certainly fall down from the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma system, as described by the words sth\u0101n\u0101d bhra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25. The words patanty adha\u1e25 indicate that one who falls from the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system will have no means of avoiding sinful activities; nor will such a person receive any credit for performing sacrifice, and thus he will gradually sink down into lower and lower species of life in hellish conditions. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that the original cause of offending the Lord and falling down from one\u2019s position is one\u2019s not learning how to properly worship a bona fide spiritual master. One who is trained to offer respectful obeisances and worship to the bona fide spiritual master automatically offers proper worship to the Supreme Lord. Without the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master, even a so-called religious man will gradually become atheistic, offend the Lord by foolish speculation and fall into a hellish condition of life. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that the puru\u1e63a mentioned in this verse is Lord Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is glorified in the Puru\u1e63a-s\u016bkta prayers. If one is proud of his high social position and enviously thinks that the Lord is also a creation of nature and that there is no absolute entity who is the origin of all beings, then such a puffed-up fool will certainly fall down from the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system and become just like an unregulated animal."

Persons such as women, \u015b\u016bdras and other fallen classes always deserve the mercy of great personalities like yourself.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse it was explained that some persons are ignorant of the glories of the Personality of Godhead (na bhajanti), whereas others, although aware of the Lord, ridicule Him or state that the Lord is also material (avaj\u0101nanti). In this verse the first class, namely the ignorant, are described as fit candidates for the mercy of a pure devotee. The word d\u016bre indicates those who have little opportunity to hear and chant the glories of the Lord. According to Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura they can be explained as ye s\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45ga-bh\u0101gya-h\u012bn\u0101\u1e25, those who are bereft of the association of saintly persons and pure devotees. Generally, those who are advanced in the spiritual science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness avoid contact with women and low-class men. In general, women are lusty, and \u015b\u016bdras and other low-class men are habitually addicted to materialistic habits such as smoking, drinking and woman hunting. Therefore, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu warned the s\u0101dhus, or saintly persons, to avoid intimate connection with women and low-class men. The practical result of such a restriction is that women and lower-class men are often bereft of the opportunity to hear the glories of the Lord chanted by saintly persons; thus \u015ar\u012b Camasa Muni instructs the King that he should especially give his mercy to such fallen persons. Our spiritual master, His Divine Grace \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da, was severely criticized in India for giving all classes of men and women the opportunity to take part in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Indeed, the caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as of India and other persons concerned only with ritualistic formalities were shocked that \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da allowed women and persons born in low-class families to take part freely in the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava culture and even become initiated as bona fide br\u0101hma\u1e47as. However, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da could understand that in this age practically everyone is fallen. He saw that if spiritual life were to be limited to the so-called higher classes, there would be no possibility of spreading a genuine spiritual movement all around the world. The mercy of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is so great and the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so potent that any man, woman, child or even animal can become purified by chanting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name and taking pras\u0101dam, the sanctified remnants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s food. In Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s movement, no sincere person is restricted from achieving the highest perfection of self-realization. Whereas the impersonalists and yog\u012bs tend to be selfishly concerned with their individual realization and achievement of mystic power, it has always been the custom of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas to be merciful to all classes of living entities. It is understood that the conversation between the nava-yogendras and King Nimi took place approximately at the time of Lord R\u0101macandra, many hundreds of thousands of years ago. But in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which was spoken only five thousand years ago, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself also states that any person, despite his material situation of life, can become the most dear devotee of the Lord by full surrender to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the fallen people of Kali-yuga should take advantage of the special mercy of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and join the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement to perfect their lives and go back home, back to Godhead."

        "purport": " It is said that a little knowledge can be very dangerous. Those who are falsely proud of material social status and who thus neglect to perfect their worship of the Personality of Godhead are condemned in this verse. Muhyanty \u0101mn\u0101ya-v\u0101dina\u1e25: becoming attracted by the sense gratification of high status within the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama social system, such persons become more attracted to illusory material philosophy than to the Absolute Truth, which is not material. Within the Vedic system, br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas, as mentioned in this verse, are all offered initiation into the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra and are considered twice-born, or highly civilized men. By studying Vedic literature, chanting Vedic mantras, executing ritualistic ceremonies and worshiping the spiritual master and the Personality of Godhead such persons gradually come near to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. If one in such an exalted position becomes proud of his status or fascinated by the heavenly material enjoyment that is undoubtedly available to the followers of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, then one so bewildered returns to the illusory material platform of birth and death. Even the highly posted demigods become victims of m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s enticement, as described in the first verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: muhyanti yat s\u016braya\u1e25. In order to justify their illusory desire to enjoy dead matter, such foolish persons condemn themselves by minimizing the necessity of worshiping the Personality of Godhead (avaj\u0101nanti) and falsely try to give equal importance to the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas, which awards heavenly sense gratification in exchange for the performance of prescribed ritualistic ceremonies. Such bogus rationalizers are described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.42): \u201cMen of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to the heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power and so on. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da\u2019s purport to this verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives a clear picture of the offensive class of men described therein. \u201cPeople in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da portions of the Vedas. They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common. In the Vedas many sacrifices are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the jyoti\u1e63\u1e6doma sacrifices. In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, similarly, unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof. \u201cIn the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da sections of the Vedas it is said that those who perform the four monthly penances become eligible to drink the soma-rasa beverage to become immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have soma-rasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratification. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called Nandana-k\u0101nana, in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of soma-rasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world.\u201d The significant point in this verse is that such bewildered materialists who have become attracted to the materialistic portions of the Vedas (muhyanty \u0101mn\u0101ya-v\u0101dina\u1e25) desire to ignore the supreme proprietorship of the Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme enjoyer (bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101m). And at the same time they wish to preserve their exalted status as followers of the Vedic principles. Such duplicitous persons take shelter of materialistic philosophers, such as Jaimini, who deny the existence of God as a tangible principle (\u012b\u015bvar\u0101siddhe\u1e25) and therefore recommend material fruitive activities as the highest knowable truth. Such so-called Vedic philosophers amount to little more than polished atheists and are therefore understood to be an\u012b\u015bvara-v\u0101dina\u1e25, or those who preach against the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although foolish materialistic followers of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system desire to maintain their exalted status as \u0100ryans, or twice-born men, and at the same time neglect the Personality of Godhead, it is clearly stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.3), sth\u0101n\u0101d bhra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25 patanty adha\u1e25: such persons inevitably fall from their position into a degraded condition of life. As confirmed in this verse by the word muhyanti, they fall into the darkness of ignorance. Sometimes such pompous persons even present themselves as gurus. However, Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that they are actually laghu, or flimsy, rather than guru, or heavy with Vedic knowledge. It is one\u2019s ultimate duty to oneself (sv\u0101rtha-gati) and to the Personality of Godhead to give up all materialistic activities characterized by karma and j\u00f1\u0101na and surrender fully at the lotus feet of the Lord. Only the most unfortunate person will consider that there is a higher pleasure than ecstatic surrender at the lotus feet of Gokul\u0101nanda, the Personality of Godhead."

Such bewildered Vedic scholars dream of frolicking with the Apsar\u0101s, the gorgeous society girls of the heavenly planets who are expert in singing, dancing and in general stimulating uncontrollable lusty desires. Thus, those who are carried away by the heavenly phantasmagoria offered in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas gradually develop an atheistic mentality. Actually, the entire universe is meant to be offered to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as sacrifice. The conditioned soul can thereby gradually elevate himself to the eternal kingdom beyond the hallucination of material sense gratification. However, being puffed up by false pride, the materialistic followers of the Vedas remain perpetually ignorant of the supremacy and beauty of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u."

Therefore they eagerly take service from their husbands and become most discouraged if the husband prefers to serve the Personality of Godhead. Being lost in such a fool\u2019s paradise, both husband and wife mutually encourage each other in temporary happiness. They do not like to speak or hear about the pastimes of the Lord, but prefer to discuss their own families. Still, the devotees of the Lord, being mature in the mode of goodness, are always ready to act mercifully toward such conditioned souls, who are just like vain animals. When the devotees of the Lord preach that human beings should not slaughter animals, materialistic householders are very often astonished and inquire if it is actually possible to subsist on a vegetarian diet. Thus being completely ignorant of the material mode of goodness, what to speak of spiritual knowledge, such condemned materialists have no hope beyond the mercy of the devotees of the Lord."

Thus the Lord is the supreme worshipable object and the absolute controller of everything.

The goal of all Vedic knowledge is to know the Lord, who is the Absolute Truth. Although this purpose of the Vedas is clearly revealed both in the Vedic literature itself and by the self-realized \u0101c\u0101ryas, foolish people cannot grasp this simple truth. They prefer to cultivate knowledge of illicit sex by discussing their sexual partners and experiences. They also eagerly describe and recommend to their friends the best restaurants for eating meat, and they are fond of glorifying drugs and liquor by elaborately describing the drunken and hallucinogenic effects of their sinful experiences. The materialistic sense gratifiers eagerly call one another on the telephone, congregate in clubs and committees, and enthusiastically go on hunting, drinking and gambling excursions, thus filling their lives with the mode of ignorance. They have neither the time nor the inclination to discuss the Absolute Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Unfortunately, they neglect the Supreme Lord, who therefore severely punishes such foolish persons in order to bring them back to their senses. Everything belongs to the Lord, and everything is meant for the Lord\u2019s enjoyment.

Instead, such sense gratifiers consider themselves to be most eloquent and learned. Every materialistic person actually feels that he is the most intelligent person, and thus he has no time to hear the actual truth. Nevertheless, the Personality of Godhead, as described in this verse, waits patiently within the heart of the conditioned soul, encouraging him to recognize the Lord, who is sitting beside him. Such recognition of the Personality of Godhead is the beginning of all auspiciousness and happiness for the conditioned soul."

        "translation": "In this material world the conditioned soul is always inclined to sex, meat-eating and intoxication. Therefore religious scriptures never actually encourage such activities. Although the scriptural injunctions provide for sex through sacred marriage, for meat-eating through sacrificial offerings and for intoxication through the acceptance of ritual cups of wine, such ceremonies are meant for the ultimate purpose of renunciation.",
        "purport": " Those who are not situated in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are always inclined toward material sense gratification in the form of illicit sex, meat-eating and intoxication. They simply desire a party life of eat, drink and be merry. Such materialistic persons are unwilling to give up such temporary gratification because they are firmly bound up in the bodily concept of life. For such persons there are numerous Vedic injunctions for rituals that bestow material sense pleasure in a regulated manner. The conditioned soul thereby becomes accustomed to indirectly worshiping the Supreme Lord by accepting the austerity of regulated sense gratification in obedience to the Vedic way of life. Through purification the living entity gradually develops a higher taste and becomes directly attracted to the spiritual nature of the Lord. Sometimes the fallen practitioners of the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas assert that the material fruitive results of Vedic ceremonies should never be given up, because they are prescribed by religious scriptures. For example, there is a Vedic injunction that in the proper season a husband must approach his wife at night at least five days after her menstrual period, if the wife has properly bathed and cleansed herself. Thus, a responsible householder should engage in religious sex life. The injunction that one must approach his wife for sex life is explained by the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas as follows. Within the material world almost every man is very lusty and desires passionate sex life with every attractive woman he meets, or with any woman at all. Actually, for an ordinary materialistic man it is an accomplishment if he can restrict himself to relationships with his lawfully wedded wife. But because familiarity breeds contempt, the natural tendency is for the husband to gradually become envious or resentful of the wife and desire illicit connections with other women. Such a mentality is most sinful and abominable, and the Vedic scripture therefore orders that one must approach his actual wife, with a desire to beget children, and thus curtail the tendency toward illicit sexual connection with other women. Were there no such Vedic injunction ordering one to approach his wife, many men would naturally be inclined to neglect their wives and pollute other women by illicit connection. However, such an injunction for conditioned souls does not apply to great souls who are fixed on the spiritual platform and are transcendental to material sex desire. As stated in this verse, niv\u1e5bttir i\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101: the actual purpose of the Vedic scriptures is to bring one back home, back to Godhead, back to the spiritual world. It is clearly stated by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, ya\u1e41 ya\u1e41 v\u0101pi smaran bh\u0101va\u1e41 tyajaty ante kalevaram: whatever we think of at the time of death will determine our next body. If one remembers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is immediately transferred to the eternal planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, since all the Vedic scriptures are meant for knowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25), the ultimate goal of the Vedas cannot be any type of absorption in the material senses, either licit or illicit. The Vedic regulations governing married sex life are actually meant to prevent sinful illicit sex. However, one should not foolishly conclude that a lusty attraction to his wife\u2019s naked body is the perfection of self-realization and Vedic elevation. The actual perfection of spiritual life is to become free from all material desires, niv\u1e5btti, and to fix the mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly there are other injunctions, governing the regulated consumption of liquor and meat. Those who are mad after meat-eating are instructed to perform Vedic ceremonies by which they are permitted to consume five types of five-clawed animals, namely the rhinoceros, turtle, rabbit, porcupine and lizard. Similarly, the consumption of specific liquors is allowed during highly restricted sacrifices performed on specific days of the year at great expense. In this way, other types of drunkenness and cruel animal slaughter are prohibited. One is gradually purified by performing such sacrifices, and he develops a distaste for such foolish activities as meat-eating and the drinking of liquor. The Vedic rules and regulations that gradually restrict sense gratification are called vidhi. The word niyama refers to injunctions governing activities that human beings ordinarily would not be inclined to perform. For example, it is said, ahar aha\u1e25 sandhy\u0101m up\u0101s\u012bta: \u201cOne should chant G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra at the three junctions of the day, every day.\u201d It is also stated, m\u0101gha-sn\u0101na\u1e41 prakurv\u012bta: \u201cOne must take bath daily, even during the coldest months of winter.\u201d Such injunctions prescribe activities that ordinarily would be neglected. Although it has been mentioned above that there are injunctions against neglecting one\u2019s lawful wife, there is no injunction against totally neglecting meat-eating. In other words, killing of animals is considered most abominable, and although some concession is made for the more violent class of men, one should actually completely give up this cruel activity because even a slight discrepancy in animal sacrifices will cause havoc in one\u2019s life. It should be understood that those who have become spiritually advanced by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra under the guidelines of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu are expected to completely give up material sense gratification. If a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a duplicitously tries to take advantage of the scriptural allowances for meat-eating, intoxication or sex enjoyment, then he commits the tenth offense against chanting. Especially if one has accepted the renounced order of life called trida\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101sa, it is most abominable and reprehensible to become attracted to the Vedic injunctions prescribing regulated sex life for householders. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b there is no such allowance for one in the renounced order of life. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs should not foolishly become bewildered by statements in the Vedic literature such as the following verse from Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u201cIt may be considered that meat-eating, intoxication and sex indulgence are natural propensities of the conditioned souls, and therefore such persons should not be condemned for these activities. But unless one gives up such sinful activities, there is no possibility of achieving the actual perfection of life.\u201d In the Kriy\u0101-vidh\u0101na it is explained that sex is permitted only during the v\u0101madeva sacrifice, or the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra for begetting of religious children. It is also stated that sometimes certain types of meat are used in worshiping Lord Hari through sacrifices to the forefathers and demigods. Similarly, there is a form of intoxication available through drinking the soma beverage. But if a so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47a becomes attracted to such offerings, he immediately becomes polluted. Actually, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who performed such offerings would not personally accept any type of liquor or meat. These things would be consumed by the k\u1e63atriyas, who were not considered at fault in accepting such remnants of sacrifice. However, in the movement of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu it can be observed that those who desire to become advanced devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately give up all such fruitive sacrifices. There is no scope in pure devotional service for any type of fruitive sacrifices. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu demanded that all of His sincere followers engage twenty-four hours a day in \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, hearing and chanting the glories of the Personality of Godhead. Those who claim to be followers of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and who are seriously planning on going back home, back to Godhead, in the near future should not become mindlessly attracted by Vedic fruitive rituals that are meant to attract those who are hopelessly bound up in the material, bodily concept of life. The followers of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu always remain aloof from such tainted rituals."

        "translation": "The only proper fruit of acquired wealth is religiosity, on the basis of which one can acquire a philosophical understanding of life that eventually matures into direct perception of the Absolute Truth and thus liberation from all suffering. Materialistic persons, however, utilize their wealth simply for the advancement of their family situation. They fail to see that insurmountable death will soon destroy the frail material body.",
        "purport": " Those things that come under the control of the proprietor are called dhanam, or wealth. When a foolish person becomes addicted to spending all of his hard-earned money to increase the prestige of his material body and family, he is no longer able to see how death is steadily approaching his own body as well as the temporary bodies of his family and friends. M\u1e5btyu\u1e25 sarva-hara\u015b c\u0101ham: the Supreme Lord appears as all-powerful death, which destroys all material situations. Actually, even in family life one should use one\u2019s wealth for spiritual advancement of oneself and one\u2019s family. In the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement there are many religious householders who live a simple, peaceful life and use their wealth for arranging K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities at home and for helping the renounced brahmac\u0101r\u012bs and sanny\u0101s\u012bs who are actively preaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in public places. Such householders, even those who are not able to dedicate one hundred percent of their energy to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, gradually acquire a very solid understanding of the spiritual principles of life and eventually become transcendentalists firmly fixed at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus they free themselves from all of the anxieties of conditional life, namely birth, old age, disease and death. Life without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is actually poverty, but the poverty-stricken materialist, whose intelligence is limited, cannot perceive that real wealth is the expansion of consciousness up to the highest level of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, love of Godhead. Such persons raise their children to be just like animals, having as their only goal false prestige and material sense gratification. Such materialistic householders fear that excessive interest in spiritual life may damage the ambition of their children to acquire false material prestige. Actually, death will smash all of the endeavors and plans of such spiritually impoverished materialists. If family life and wealth are used for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one will learn to discriminate between the eternal and the noneternal, between spirit and matter, between bliss and anxiety, and thus the living entity will become liberated and go beyond mere theoretical knowledge to acquire the highest perfectional benediction of eternal K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious life. Limited sensory knowledge, pratyak\u1e63a-j\u00f1\u0101na, is useless without theoretical spiritual knowledge, parok\u1e63a-j\u00f1\u0101na, which gradually matures, with careful cultivation, into direct realized knowledge of the soul, aparok\u1e63a-j\u00f1\u0101na. The word anupra\u015b\u0101nti in this verse indicates that by spiritual knowledge (vij\u00f1\u0101nam) one achieves the most sublime state of eternal peace and bliss, far beyond the dreams of the materialistic conditioned soul."

        "translation": "According to the Vedic injunctions, when wine is offered in sacrificial ceremonies it is later to be consumed by smelling, and not by drinking. Similarly, the sacrificial offering of animals is permitted, but there is no provision for wide-scale animal slaughter. Religious sex life is also permitted, but only in marriage for begetting children, and not for sensuous exploitation of the body. Unfortunately, however, the less intelligent materialists cannot understand that their duties in life should be performed purely on the spiritual platform.",
        "purport": " Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has given the following statement in regard to animal sacrifice: According to this statement, the Vedas sometimes prescribe animal sacrifice in ritual performances for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord or a particular demigod. If, however, one whimsically slaughters animals without rigidly following the Vedic prescriptions, such killing is actual violence and should not be accepted by any intelligent person. If the animal sacrifice is perfectly performed, the sacrificed animal immediately goes to the heavenly planets of the demigods and the forefathers. Therefore such a sacrifice is not for killing animals but for demonstrating the potency of Vedic mantras, by the power of which the sacrificed creature is immediately promoted to a higher situation. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, however, has forbidden such animal sacrifice in this age because there are no qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as to chant the mantras, and the so-called sacrificial arena becomes an ordinary butcher shop. And in an earlier era, when unscrupulous persons tried to establish that animal killing and meat-eating are acceptable by misinterpreting the Vedic sacrifices, Lord Buddha personally appeared and rejected their heinous proposition. This is described by Jayadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b: Unfortunately, the conditioned souls are afflicted by four imperfections, one of which is the cheating propensity, and thus they tend to exploit the concessions that the Lord mercifully gives to them in religious scriptures for their gradual purification. Rather than follow the Vedic injunctions for simultaneously satisfying their senses and gradually elevating themselves, the conditioned souls reject the actual purpose of such apparently materialistic ceremonies and simply become more and more degraded in the ignorance of the bodily concept of life. Thus they fall down altogether from the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system and, taking birth in violent non-Vedic societies, foolishly presume the small fragments of universal religious principles prevalent there to be the exclusive religion of the soul. As a result, they fall into fanaticism, embracing merely sectarian, dogmatic views of religion. Such unfortunate persons are completely out of touch with their own eternal function in life and consider things to be vastly different than they are in reality."

In their next lives, such sinful persons will be eaten by the same creatures they have killed in this world.",
        "purport": " In this verse we can clearly see the great discrepancies in those persons who do not surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His law. As stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam, har\u0101v abhaktasya kuto mahad-gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e25: those who do not accept the supremacy of the Supreme Lord gradually become infected with the most sinful propensities that bring, in their turn, terrible suffering upon the nondevotees. In the Western countries such as America, many people proudly proclaim themselves to be most pious religionists and sometimes even prophets or representatives of God. Boasting of their religiosity, such foolish people experience no fear or doubt in cruelly slaughtering innumerable animals in slaughterhouses or on hunting trips for their whimsical sense gratification. In the state of Mississippi there are sometimes pig-killing festivals, in which entire families enjoy watching a pig cruelly butchered before their eyes. Similarly, a former president of the United States from Texas did not consider any social occasion complete without the slaughtering of a cow. Such persons mistakenly consider themselves to be perfectly observing the laws of God and due to such arrogant foolishness lose all touch with reality. When a man is raising an animal for slaughter, he feeds the animal nicely and encourages it to grow fat. Thus the animal gradually accepts its would-be killer as its protector and master. When the master finally approaches the helpless animal with a sharp knife or gun, the animal thinks, \u201cOh, my master is joking with me.\u201d Only at the last minute does the animal understand that the so-called master is death personified. It is clearly stated in Vedic literature that cruel masters who kill innocent animals will undoubtedly be killed in the next life by a similar process. \u201c\u2018That creature whose flesh I am eating here and now will consume me in the next life.\u2019 Thus meat is called m\u0101\u1e41sa, as described by learned authorities.\u201d In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam this grisly fate of animal killers is described by N\u0101rada Muni to King Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi, who was excessively killing animals in so-called sacrifices. \u201cO ruler of the citizens, my dear King, please see in the sky those animals which you have sacrificed, without compassion and without mercy, in the sacrificial arena. All these animals are awaiting your death so that they can avenge the injuries you have inflicted upon them. After you die, they will angrily pierce your body with iron horns.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 4.25.7-8) Such punishment of animal killers may take place under the jurisdiction of Yamar\u0101ja on the planet of the lord of death. In other words, one who kills an animal or who eats meat undoubtedly acquires a debt to the living entity who has contributed his body for the satisfaction of the meat-eater. The meat-eater must pay his debt by contributing his own body to be consumed in the next life. Such payment of one\u2019s debt by offering one\u2019s own body to be eaten is confirmed in the Vedic literature."

        "translation": "Those who have not achieved knowledge of the Absolute Truth, yet who are still beyond the darkness of complete ignorance, generally follow the threefold path of pious material life, namely religiosity, economic development and sense gratification. Not having time to reflect on any higher purpose, they become the killers of their own soul.",
        "purport": " Those who are completely in the darkness of ignorance and thus bereft even of material pious life commit innumerable sinful activities and suffer greatly. Due to such intense suffering such persons sometimes seek the shelter of the devotees of the Lord and, being blessed by such transcendental association, are sometimes elevated to the highest perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are not completely sinful experience some mitigation of the miseries of material life and thus develop a false sense of well-being within the material world. Because those who are materially pious generally obtain worldly prosperity, bodily beauty and a pleasant family situation, they become falsely proud of their position and are not inclined to associate with or accept instructions from the devotees of the Lord. Unfortunately, all material activities, whether pious or impious, are inevitably contaminated by sinful activity. Those who are proud of their piety and do not like to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sooner or later fall down from their artificial position. Every living entity is an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, until we surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, our position is actually always impious. The word ak\u1e63a\u1e47ik\u0101\u1e25 (\u201cnot having even a moment to reflect\u201d) is significant in this verse. Materialistic persons cannot spare a single moment for their eternal self-interest. This is a symptom of misfortune. Such persons are considered to be killing their own souls because by their obstinacy they are preparing a dark future for themselves from which they will not escape for a very long time. A sick man receiving medical treatment may be encouraged by the preliminary results of the doctor\u2019s care. But if the patient becomes falsely proud of the preliminary progress in his treatment and prematurely gives up the doctor\u2019s orders, thinking himself already cured, there will undoubtedly be a relapse. The words ye kaivalyam asampr\u0101pt\u0101\u1e25 in this verse clearly indicate that material piety is a long way from perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth. If one gives up his spiritual progress before achieving the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will undoubtedly fall back down into the most unpleasant material situation, even if he has achieved impersonal realization of the Brahman effulgence.

Those who are self-realized know this supreme reality of the Personality of Godhead as Param\u0101tm\u0101. Those souls who are situated in the religious system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama glorify Him as the ha\u1e41sa who is transcendental to all the var\u1e47as and \u0101\u015bramas.

Persons accustomed to wandering within this universe of subtle and gross matter created by the Lord\u2019s illusory potency chant His name Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Persons deprived of the power of transcendental meditation (dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101), who are thus subject to falling from the path of religion, glorify Him as Dharma, or religion personified. Those who are forced to submit to the illusory modes of material nature and whose minds are uncontrolled and disturbed glorify Him as the most perfectly self-controlled Yoge\u015bvara. Persons tainted by a mixture of the modes of passion and ignorance call Him Amala, or the uncontaminated. Persons devoid of potency call Him \u012a\u015bvara, and those who consider themselves to be under His shelter chant His glories by the name Uttama Puru\u1e63a. Those who know that this material manifestation is only temporary call Him Avyakta. In this way, in Satya-yuga Lord V\u0101sudeva appears in various four-armed transcendental forms, and the j\u012bva souls worship Him, each by their own particular process of devotional service. Therefore the Supreme Lord has many different names."

        "purport": " When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was leaving the city of Hastin\u0101pura, Arjuna personally held an umbrella over the Lord, and Uddhava and S\u0101tyaki fanned the Lord with decorated fans (Bh\u0101g. 1.10.17, 18). In this way, Emperor Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and his followers worshiped K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the greatest of noble kings and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, at the R\u0101jas\u016bya sacrifice all of the great souls of the universe elected K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the King of all kings, the greatest personality, deserving of first worship. Such reverential worship of the Lord is characteristic of Dv\u0101para-yuga, as described in this verse (mah\u0101-r\u0101jopalak\u1e63a\u1e47am). With each successive yuga, namely Satya, Tret\u0101, Dv\u0101para and Kali, the condition of human society deteriorates more and more. As mentioned in this verse, the only favorable qualification of the residents of Dv\u0101para-yuga is that they are jij\u00f1\u0101sava\u1e25, strongly desirous of knowing the Absolute Truth. Otherwise there is no good qualification mentioned. The inhabitants of Satya-yuga were described as \u015b\u0101nt\u0101\u1e25, nirvair\u0101\u1e25, suh\u1e5bda\u1e25 and sam\u0101\u1e25, or peaceful, free from envy, the well-wishers of every living entity, and fixed on the spiritual platform beyond the modes of material nature. Similarly the inhabitants of Tret\u0101-yuga were described as dharmi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u1e25 and brahma-v\u0101dina\u1e25, or thoroughly religious, and expert followers of the Vedic injunctions. In the present verse, the inhabitants of Dv\u0101para-yuga are said to be simply jij\u00f1\u0101sava\u1e25, desiring to know the Absolute Truth. Otherwise they are described as marty\u0101\u1e25, or subject to the weakness of mortal beings. If the human society of even Dv\u0101para-yuga was clearly inferior to that of Satya and Tret\u0101-yugas, we can hardly imagine the truly disastrous condition of human society in Kali-yuga. Therefore, as will be mentioned in the following verses, human beings who have taken their birth in the present Age of Kali should attach themselves rigidly to the movement of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu to free themselves from foolishness."

O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all obeisances unto You. O Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u1e5a\u1e63i, O creator of the universe, best of personalities, master of this cosmos and original form of the universe, O Supersoul of all created entities, all homage unto You.\u201d",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b explains that although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared at the end of Dv\u0101para-yuga, great sages chanted this verse from the beginning of that age in expectation of His appearance. Ordinary living entities, although eternally subordinate to the Lord, become absorbed in attempting to dominate the material creation yet ultimately remain under the control of the Supreme Lord. The constitutional position of the living entity is engagement in the Lord\u2019s service. It is further the constitutional position of the material nature to be engaged by the living entity in satisfying the transcendental desires of the Lord. Thus these prayers, as mentioned in this verse, are offered to the Supreme Lord in accordance with the Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra and the Vedic mantras so that one may become fixed in remembering his eternal subordination to the Absolute Truth. The supreme living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, eternally manifests Himself as the catur-vy\u016bha, or quadruple plenary expansion. The purport of this prayer is that one should give up his false ego and pray to this catur-vy\u016bha by offering Them obeisances. Although the Absolute Truth is one without a second, the Absolute Truth displays His unlimited opulences and potencies by expanding Himself in innumerable plenary forms, of which the catur-vy\u016bha is a principal expansion. The original being is V\u0101sudeva, the Personality of Godhead. When the Godhead manifests His primeval energies and opulences, He is called Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. Pradyumna is the basis of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansion who is the soul of the entire universe, and Aniruddha is the basis of the personal manifestation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as the Supersoul of every individual entity within the universe. Among the four plenary expansions mentioned here, the original expansion is V\u0101sudeva, and the other three are considered to be particular manifestations of Him. When the living entity forgets that both he himself as well as the material nature are meant for the Lord\u2019s service, the quality of ignorance becomes prominent, and the conditioned entity desires to become himself the master. Thus the conditioned soul imagines that he is a very important person within society or that he is a great philosopher. The Vedic mantras and Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra give mankind instructions about devotional service to the Personality of Godhead, which free one from the contamination of considering oneself a prestigious member of society or a great philosopher. One in knowledge should recognize himself as a tiny servant of the Supreme Absolute Truth. In Dv\u0101para-yuga, Deity worship of the Lord is prominent. Such Deity worship is ultimately aimed at the process of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. Without hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord one cannot perform Deity worship. In Deity worship it is required that the worshiper glorify the names, forms, qualities, paraphernalia, entourage and pastimes of the Supreme Lord. When such glorification is complete, the worshiper becomes eligible to realize transcendental knowledge through hearing about the Lord."

        "purport": " The words kal\u0101v api, \u201cin Kali-yuga also,\u201d are very important in this verse. It is well known that Kali-yuga is an irreligious age. Thus it is surprising that in such a completely irreligious age the Supreme Lord is worshiped. Therefore it is stated kal\u0101v api, \u201ceven in Kali-yuga.\u201d In Kali-yuga the incarnation of the Personality of Godhead does not directly assert Himself to be the Personality of Godhead, but rather He is detected by expert devotees in accordance with the revealed Vedic scriptures. Similarly, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja states in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (7.9.38): \u201cIn this way, my Lord, You appear in various incarnations as a human being, an animal, a great saintly demigod, a fish or a tortoise, thus maintaining the entire creation in different planetary systems and killing the demoniac principles. According to the age, O my Lord, You protect the principles of religion. In the Age of Kali, however, You do not assert Yourself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore You are known as Triyuga, or the Lord who appears in three yugas.\u201d Thus it is understood that it is difficult for common people in Kali-yuga to recognize the incarnation of the Lord since in this age the Lord\u2019s appearance is slightly concealed. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura the word n\u0101n\u0101-tantra-vidh\u0101nena indicates the importance in Kali-yuga of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava scriptures known as the Pa\u00f1car\u0101tras or S\u0101tvata-pa\u00f1car\u0101tras. It is stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam, str\u012b-\u015b\u016bdra-dvija-bandh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 tray\u012b na \u015bruti-gocar\u0101: in Kali-yuga it is impossible for ordinary people to perform highly technical Vedic sacrifices or the unbearable penances of the mystic yoga system. Such standard Vedic processes are practically inaccessible for the spiritually retarded population of Kali-yuga. Therefore the simple process of glorifying the Personality of Godhead by chanting His holy names is essential in this age. Such devotional processes as chanting the holy names of the Lord and worshiping His Deity form are elaborately described in the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u015b\u0101stras known as Pa\u00f1car\u0101tras. Such tantric scriptures are referred to in this verse, and it is stated that in Kali-yuga these devotional processes, taught by great \u0101c\u0101ryas such as N\u0101rada Muni, are the only practical means for worshiping the Lord. This will be more clearly explained in the following verse."

That golden Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Lord Caitanya, who is worshiped by intelligent men in this age.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47am and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Caitanya are equivalent. The name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears with both Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord Caitanya K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He always engages in describing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thus enjoying transcendental bliss by chanting and remembering His name and form. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself appears as Lord Caitanya to preach the highest gospel. Var\u1e47ayati means \u2018utters\u2019 or \u2018describes.\u2019 Lord Caitanya always chants the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and describes it also, and because He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, whoever meets Him will automatically chant the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and later describe it to others. He injects one with transcendental K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which merges the chanter in transcendental bliss. In all respects, therefore, He appears before everyone as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, either by personality or by sound. Simply by seeing Lord Caitanya one at once remembers Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One may therefore accept Him as vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva. In other words, Lord Caitanya is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. \u201cS\u0101\u1e45gop\u0101\u1e45g\u0101stra-p\u0101r\u1e63adam further indicates that Lord Caitanya is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His body is always decorated with ornaments of sandalwood and with sandalwood paste. By His superexcellent beauty He subdues all the people of the age. In other descents the Lord sometimes used weapons to defeat the demoniac, but in this age the Lord subdues them with His all-attractive figure as Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b explains that His beauty is His astra, or weapon, to subdue the demons. Because He is all-attractive, it is to be understood that all the demigods lived with Him as His companions. His acts were uncommon and His associates wonderful. When He propagated the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement, He attracted many great scholars and \u0101c\u0101ryas, especially in Bengal and Orissa. Lord Caitanya is always accompanied by His best associates like Lord Nity\u0101nanda, Advaita, Gad\u0101dhara and \u015ar\u012bv\u0101sa. \u201c\u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b cites a verse from the Vedic literature that says that there is no necessity of performing sacrificial demonstrations or ceremonial functions. He comments that instead of engaging in such external, pompous exhibitions, all people, regardless of caste, color or creed, can assemble together and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to worship Lord Caitanya. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tvi\u1e63\u0101k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47am indicates that prominence should be given to the name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord Caitanya taught K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and chanted the name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, to worship Lord Caitanya, everyone should together chant the mah\u0101-mantra \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. To propagate worship in churches, temples or mosques is not possible because people have lost interest in that. But anywhere and everywhere, people can chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus worshiping Lord Caitanya, they can perform the highest activity and fulfill the highest religious purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord. \u201c\u015ar\u012bla S\u0101rvabhauma Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101c\u0101rya, a famous disciple of Lord Caitanya, said: \u2018The principle of transcendental devotional service having been lost, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Caitanya has appeared to deliver again the process of devotion. He is so kind that He is distributing love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Everyone should be attracted more and more to His lotus feet, as humming bees are attracted to a lotus flower.\u2019\u201d The incarnation of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is also described in the \u015ar\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-sahasra-n\u0101ma, which appears in Chapter 189 of the D\u0101na-dharma-parva of Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has quoted this reference as follows: suvar\u1e47a-var\u1e47o hem\u0101\u1e45go var\u0101\u1e45ga\u015b candan\u0101\u1e45gad\u012b. \u201cIn His early pastimes He appears as a householder with a golden complexion. His limbs are beautiful, and His body, smeared with the pulp of sandalwood, seems like molten gold.\u201d He has also quoted, sanny\u0101sa-k\u1e5bc chama\u1e25 \u015b\u0101nto ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101-\u015b\u0101nti-par\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25: \u201cIn His later pastimes He accepts the sanny\u0101sa order, and He is equipoised and peaceful. He is the highest abode of peace and devotion, for He silences the impersonalist nondevotees.\u201d"

Those feet destroy the embarrassing conditions of material life and freely award the greatest desire of the soul, the attainment of pure love of Godhead. My dear Lord, Your lotus feet are the shelter of all holy places and of all saintly authorities in the line of devotional service and are honored by powerful demigods like Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. My Lord, You are so kind that You willingly protect all those who simply bow down to You with respect, and thus You mercifully relieve all the distress of Your servants. In conclusion, my Lord, Your lotus feet are actually the suitable boat for crossing over the ocean of birth and death, and therefore even Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva seek shelter at Your lotus feet.\u201d",
        "purport": " The incarnation of the Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga is described and worshiped in this verse. The sage Karabh\u0101jana, after describing the incarnation of Godhead in each of the three previous yugas \u2014 Satya, Tret\u0101 and Dv\u0101para \u2014 presented suitable prayers which are utilized for glorifying the Lord in each particular age. After describing the Lord\u2019s manifestation in Kali-yuga with the verse k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tvi\u1e63\u0101k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47am, this and the next verse are now presented to glorify the Lord\u2019s appearance in Kali-yuga as Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47am. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu appears in Kali-yuga and teaches everyone to chant the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The members of the ISKCON movement are so much absorbed in k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47am, or chanting the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that sometimes ordinary persons refer to them as \u201cthe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as.\u201d Thus whoever comes into contact with Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s movement immediately begins to worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by chanting His holy name. The words dhyeya\u1e41 sad\u0101, or \u201calways to be meditated upon,\u201d indicate that there are no hard-and-fast rules in this age for chanting the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In Kali-yuga the authorized process of meditation is to chant the holy names of the Lord, especially the mantra Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. This process is to be executed constantly and always (sad\u0101). Similarly, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu stated, n\u0101mn\u0101m ak\u0101ri bahudh\u0101 nija-sarva-\u015baktis tatr\u0101rpit\u0101 niyamita\u1e25 smara\u1e47e na k\u0101la\u1e25: in Kali-yuga, the Supreme Lord has kindly invested all of His potencies in His holy name, and there are no hard-and-fast rules for chanting such names. The mention of such rules refers to k\u0101la-de\u015ba-niyama, or regulations of time and place. Normally there are strict regulations governing the time, season, place, conditions, etc., under which one may execute a particular Vedic ceremony or chant a particular mantra. However, one should chant the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere and at all times, twenty-four hours a day. Thus there is no restriction in terms of time and place. This is the meaning of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s statement. The word paribhava-ghnam is significant in this verse. In Kali-yuga human society is infected with enviousness. There is great envy, even among members of the same family, who constantly quarrel in this age. Similarly, neighbors are envious of each other and of each other\u2019s possessions and status. And entire nations, burning with envy, go to war unnecessarily at the risk of genocide caused by terrible modern weapons. But all of these harassments caused by family members, strangers, so-called friends who are unfaithful, opposing nations, financial competition, social disgrace, cancer, etc., can be relieved by taking shelter of the lotus feet of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. It is not possible to save the material body, but one who takes shelter of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu loosens the hard knot of the heart that psychologically binds him to the hallucination of identifying with the external body or the subtle material mind. Once this false identification is broken, one can be blissful in any adverse material condition. Those who foolishly try to make the temporary body eternal are wasting their time and neglecting the actual process for making life permanent, which is to take shelter of the lotus feet of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. In this verse the word t\u012brth\u0101spadam means that the lotus feet of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu are the shelter of all holy places. As the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement spreads all over the world, we often find, especially in poor third-world countries, that it is very difficult for people to travel to India to visit the most exalted holy places such as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and M\u0101y\u0101pur. Especially in South America it is very difficult for a large number of devotees to visit such places in India and purify themselves. But Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is so merciful that simply by worshiping Him, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas throughout the world receive the benefit of having visited the supreme holy place, namely the lotus feet of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Thus there is no loss for the followers of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, despite their external situation. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has stated, kalau dravya-de\u015ba-kriy\u0101di-janita\u1e41 durv\u0101ram ap\u0101vitryam api n\u0101\u015ba\u1e45kan\u012byam iti bh\u0101va\u1e25. In this age the world is so polluted by sinful life that it is very difficult to become free from all of the symptoms of Kali-yuga. Still, one who is faithfully serving in the missionary work of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu need not fear occasional, unavoidable symptoms of Kali-yuga. The followers of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu strictly follow the four regulative principles of no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating and no gambling. They try to always chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engage in the service of the Lord. However, it may happen that by accident an occasional symptom of Kali-yuga such as envy, anger, lust, greed, etc., may momentarily appear in the life of a devotee. But if such a devotee is actually surrendered at the lotus feet of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, by His mercy such an unwanted symptom, or anartha, will quickly disappear. Therefore, a sincere follower of the Lord should never be discouraged in the execution of his prescribed duty but should be confident that he will be protected by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. It is also mentioned in this verse, \u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam. Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 are undoubtedly the two most powerful personalities within this universe. Still, they meticulously worship the lotus feet of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Why? \u015aara\u1e47yam. Even Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 are not safe without the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. The words bh\u1e5bty\u0101rti-ha\u1e41 pra\u1e47ata-p\u0101la indicate that if one simply bows down without duplicity at the lotus feet of the Lord (pra\u1e47ata), then the Lord will give such a sincere candidate all protection. This verse does not mention that one need be an exalted devotee of the Lord. Rather, it is stated that if one simply bows down at the Lord\u2019s lotus feet he will get all protection, and this also applies to anyone who is trying to serve the mission of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Even the neophyte will get all protection by the mercy of the Lord. In regard to the words bhav\u0101bdhi-potam, or \u201ca suitable boat for crossing the ocean of material existence,\u201d there is the following statement by Lord Brahm\u0101 and other demigods in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: tvat-p\u0101da-potena mahat-k\u1e5btena kurvanti go-vatsa-pada\u1e41 bhav\u0101bdhim. \u201cBy accepting Your lotus feet as the boat by which to cross the ocean of nescience, one follows in the footsteps of the mah\u0101janas and can cross that ocean as easily as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf.\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, a follower of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is j\u012bvan-mukta, or a liberated soul. Thus the devotee is not worried about his future destination, for he is confident that the Lord will quickly take him across the ocean of material existence. Such confidence is referred to in the Upade\u015b\u0101m\u1e5bta by the word ni\u015bcay\u0101t, meaning firm conviction about the potency of the process of devotional service. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the statement \u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam is also understood to indicate that Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is worshiped by Lord \u015aiva\u2019s incarnation Advaita \u0100c\u0101rya and by Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s incarnation Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is addressed in this verse as mah\u0101-puru\u1e63a, meaning puru\u1e63ottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, there is reference to mah\u0101prabhu in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.12), mah\u0101n prabhur vai puru\u1e63a\u1e25 sattvasyai\u1e63a pravartaka\u1e25: \u201cThe supreme prabhu is the Personality of Godhead, who is the initiator of the entire cosmos.\u201d Similarly, Lord \u015ar\u012b Gaurak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is addressed by the word mah\u0101-puru\u1e63a in this verse, and the whole intention of this verse is to offer obeisances at His lotus feet. Such lotus feet are the actual eternal object of meditation because they cut off the bondage of material life and fulfill the desires of the devotees. Although the conditioned souls laboring arduously under illusion pursue many temporary goals in life, there is no possibility of their achieving actual bliss or knowledge. Such eternal bliss and knowledge is actually wealth. One should not neglect the lotus feet of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, taking Him to be an ordinary person, and instead accept the temporary, useless shelter offered by the illusory energy of the Lord. Those yog\u012bs who falsely select some other object of meditation besides the lotus feet of the Lord are simply creating obstructions to their own eternal life. When the meditator, the meditation and the object of meditation are all on the eternal platform of the Lord, then actual shelter has been achieved. Generally the conditioned souls are engaged in bhoga-ty\u0101ga. Sometimes they run madly after material prestige and sense gratification, and sometimes they desperately try to renounce these things. However, beyond this vicious cycle of alternating sense gratification and renunciation are the lotus feet of the Lord, which constitute the ultimate abode of peace and happiness for the living entity. The following are additional notes on this verse given by \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura. dhyeyam \u2014 the object indicated by the word dh\u012bmahi in the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra. t\u012brth\u0101spadam \u2014 the original shelter of holy places headed by \u015ar\u012b Gau\u1e0dak\u1e63etra and Vraja-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala; or the original shelter, namely the lotus feet of the Lord, of the great devotees of the Brahma samprad\u0101ya following in the succession of faithful hearing. The succession of faithful hearing begins with \u015ar\u012bmad \u0100nandat\u012brtha (Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya) and is continued by the r\u016bp\u0101nuga mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavatas, the highly elevated followers of R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. \u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam \u2014 He who is worshiped by the incarnation of Lord \u015aiva, \u015ar\u012bmad Advait\u0101c\u0101rya Prabhu, and by the incarnation of Lord Viri\u00f1ci, \u015ar\u012bm\u0101n \u0100c\u0101rya Harid\u0101sa Prabhu. bh\u1e5bty\u0101rti-ham \u2014 He who destroyed by His causeless mercy the misery of His own servant, the br\u0101hma\u1e47a V\u0101sudeva, who was afflicted with leprosy in caitanya-l\u012bl\u0101. bhav\u0101bdhi-potam \u2014 the means of crossing over the ocean of sa\u1e41s\u0101ra; or the shelter of those who are freeing themselves from material existence, which afflicts the living entity in the form of hankering for liberation or material enjoyment. Such persons who took advantage of this transcendental boat of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet are S\u0101rvabhauma Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101c\u0101rya, who was saved from mukti-k\u0101ma, or desire for liberation, and Prat\u0101parudra Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who was saved from bhukti-k\u0101ma, or the desire for material opulence."

        "translation": "O Mah\u0101-puru\u1e63a, I worship Your lotus feet. You gave up the association of the goddess of fortune and all her opulence, which is most difficult to renounce and is hankered after by even the great demigods. Being the most faithful follower of the path of religion, You thus left for the forest in obedience to a br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s curse. Out of sheer mercifulness You chased after the fallen conditioned souls, who are always in pursuit of the false enjoyment of illusion, and at the same time engaged in searching out Your own desired object, Lord \u015ay\u0101masundara.",
        "purport": " According to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas, this important verse of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is understood to describe Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and also Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101macandra. This verse appears within the discussion by the sage Karabh\u0101jana of the yug\u0101vat\u0101ras, or the different incarnations of the Personality of Godhead who deliver the conditioned souls of each age. The prayers ending with the words vande mah\u0101-puru\u1e63a te cara\u1e47\u0101ravindam are understood to glorify the incarnation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Kali-yuga known as Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu lived for twenty-four years in Navadv\u012bpa as a householder and enjoyed immense popularity among both scholars and ordinary persons. His sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement was completely supported by the local government, even though it was Muslim. And Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu had the pleasure of marrying the goddess of fortune. No ordinary woman of the material world, no matter how gorgeous she may be, can in any way compare with the beautiful goddess of fortune. Everyone in the universe, including Lord Brahm\u0101, is searching after the goddess of fortune. Therefore it is stated here, surepsita. However, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appearing as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and therefore He is certainly dharmi\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e25, or the most religious. Actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always dharmi\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e25, whether He appears as a cowherd boy, a great king or a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, because the Lord Himself is the original source and personification of all religious principles. However, in the pastimes of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu there are very few political or economic activities. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu appeared as a great philosopher-br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and thus He is certainly dharmi\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e25. In Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, in the Seventeenth Chapter of the \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101, it is described that a certain br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who was well known for being harsh and cursing others, could not enter the k\u012brtana hall where Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was performing k\u012brtana because the door was locked. Being very agitated and breaking his br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s thread, he cursed Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu the next day on the bank of the Ganges, saying, \u201cI shall now curse You, for Your behavior has greatly aggrieved me. You shall be bereft of all material happiness.\u201d However, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu felt great jubilation within Himself, since His mission was vair\u0101gya-vidy\u0101-nija-bhakti-yoga \u2014 to give up the illusion of material sense gratification and staunchly engage twenty-four hours a day in the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu took this curse as a blessing, and soon after, the Lord took sanny\u0101sa. Thus it is stated in this verse that by the words of the \u0100ryan, the br\u0101hma\u1e47a (\u0101rya-vacas\u0101), Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu took sanny\u0101sa (yad ag\u0101d ara\u1e47yam) and went traveling through the different forests of India on the way to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and later South India. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu wanted especially to preserve the prestige of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a class, and therefore He decided to keep the br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s curse intact. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has explained the word m\u0101y\u0101-m\u1e5bgam as follows. M\u0101y\u0101 means one\u2019s so-called wife, children and bank account, which keep one firmly bound up in the material bodily concept of life. The word m\u1e5bgam indicates m\u1e5bgyati, or \u201cto search out.\u201d Thus, m\u0101y\u0101-m\u1e5bgam indicates the conditioned living entity, who is always frantically searching for the latest up-to-the-minute sense gratification in the material bodily concept of society, friendship and love. Anvadh\u0101vat indicates that Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was always visibly going here and there, searching after the fallen conditioned souls. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu would sometimes embrace the conditioned souls on the pretext of religious friendship or ecstasy. But actually, the Lord was touching the bodies of the conditioned souls to pull them out of the ocean of material existence and hurl them into the ocean of ecstatic love of Godhead. Thus Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was the most merciful and munificent incarnation of the Lord, whose mercy surpassed the bounds of mundane discrimination in the matter of caste, color and creed. The word dayitay\u0101 can be explained as follows. The Sanskrit word day\u0101 means \u201cmercy.\u201d Thus, by grammatical derivation, the word used in this verse, dayitay\u0101, indicates that because of being the most merciful, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was busily engaged in rescuing the fallen conditioned souls, who are completely distracted and bewildered by the external illusory energy of the Lord. The quality of being the most merciful is part and parcel of the character of the mah\u0101-puru\u1e63a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, this verse also describes the incarnation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in His original blackish form. Thus the words surepsita-r\u0101jya-lak\u1e63m\u012bm indicate \u015br\u012b-mathur\u0101-sampattim, or the opulence of Mathur\u0101. Mathur\u0101 is described in Vedic literature as the reservoir of all opulence because of the touch of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet in that precinct. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although taking birth in the opulent city of Mathur\u0101, transferred Himself to the forest village of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In this case the word \u0101rya-vacas\u0101 indicates the order of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s original parents, Vasudeva and Devak\u012b. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.3.22, 29) both Vasudeva and Devak\u012b express their fear at the threat of Ka\u1e41sa, who had already killed all of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s elder brothers. The word \u0101rya-vacas\u0101 thus indicates that with great love they requested K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kindly make some arrangement to avoid Ka\u1e41sa. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, to obey their order, transferred Himself to the forest village of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana (yad ag\u0101d ara\u1e47yam). In this context, the words m\u0101y\u0101-m\u1e5bgam indicate the special, exalted relationship between \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b and \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. M\u0101y\u0101 also indicates the internal potency of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. The original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s internal potency is \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. Due to the inconceivable love of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes easily controlled by Her. Thus, m\u1e5bgam, or \u201canimal,\u201d in this case indicates kr\u012b\u1e0d\u0101-m\u1e5bgam, or \u201ca toy animal.\u201d Just as a beautiful young girl may play with so many dolls or stuffed animals, similarly Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes just like a doll in the hands of the most beautiful young girl, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b performed innumerable types of worship in order to bind K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a more and more to Her because \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b cannot live without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus, due to \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s \u0101r\u0101dhana, or worship, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can never leave V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He runs here and there in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, protecting the cows, playing with His friends and engaging in countless intrigues of love with \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b and the gop\u012bs. Thus the word anvadh\u0101vat indicates K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s boyish activities, His running throughout the transcendental land of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, tightly under the control of the love of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has explained how this verse also describes the incarnation of Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101macandra. Although the Lord is completely independent and detached from everything, He becomes attached to His pure devotees due to their love for Him. In the great capital of Ayodhy\u0101 all of the citizens loved R\u0101macandra more than can be described. In this context \u0101rya-vacas\u0101 means that by the order of His father, who was just like His guru, R\u0101macandra gave up everything and went to the forest. There He exhibited His great affection for mother S\u012bt\u0101 and chased after m\u0101y\u0101-m\u1e5bgam, or the illusory deer that had been created by the trick of R\u0101va\u1e47a. That this golden deer was especially desired by \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b is indicated by the word dayitayepsitam. All of the limbs of the Lord\u2019s transcendental body are nondifferent and interchangeable, as stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.32): All of the limbs (a\u1e45g\u0101ni) of the Supreme Lord are sakalendriya-v\u1e5bttimanti, or possessing all of the functions of all of the other limbs. Thus the two lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead are a plenary representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worshiping the Lord\u2019s lotus feet immediately places the worshiper in the ocean of transcendental bliss. There is no factual difference in spiritual quality between the incarnations of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101macandra. As stated in Vedic literatures, advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam. Therefore there is no contradiction in the opinions of the \u0101c\u0101ryas that this verse wonderfully glorifies three different manifestations of the one Absolute Truth. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is undoubtedly the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His transcendental attributes fulfill in every sense of the term the descriptions of the Absolute Truth as given in Vedic literature. In Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, in the Third Chapter of the \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja Gosv\u0101m\u012b and \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da have given elaborate explanations of the transcendental status of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, which the reader can refer to for further information. Everyone should follow the example of the sage Karabh\u0101jana and worship the lotus feet of the Mah\u0101prabhu, the mah\u0101-puru\u1e63a, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. One should not rot on the platform of mental speculation and whimsical interpretation but should actually revive his lost relationship with the Absolute Truth by surrendering to Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Those who are worshiping Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu are deriving wonderful spiritual results and are tasting the fruit of love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, vande mah\u0101-puru\u1e63a te cara\u1e47\u0101ravindam: let us humbly bow down at the lotus feet of the original Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who is the mah\u0101-puru\u1e63a glorified within \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Corroborating the explanation of this verse, the followers of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also worship Him in His six-armed form of \u1e63a\u1e0d-bhuja. Two arms carry the waterpot and da\u1e47\u1e0da of the sanny\u0101s\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, two arms carry the flute of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and two arms carry the bow and arrow of \u015ar\u012b R\u0101macandra. This \u1e63a\u1e0d-bhuja form is the actual purport of this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

        "purport": " The word yug\u0101nur\u016bp\u0101bhy\u0101m is significant here. Anur\u016bpa means \u201csuitable\u201d or \u201cappropriate.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, anxiously desires that all conditioned living entities come back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Thus, the Lord reveals Himself in each of the four ages \u2014 Satya, Tret\u0101, Dv\u0101para and Kali \u2014 in a form appropriate for worship by the human beings of that age. In his Laghu-bh\u0101gavat\u0101m\u1e5bta (P\u016brva-kha\u1e47\u1e0da 1.25), \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b states: \u201cThe Supreme Lord Hari is described in terms of His color and names as \u015bukla [white, or the most pure] in Satya-yuga, and as red, dark blue and black respectively in Tret\u0101, Dv\u0101para and Kali.\u201d Thus, although in each age various names suitable for glorifying the Lord are given, such as Ha\u1e41sa and Supar\u1e47a in Satya-yuga, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Yaj\u00f1a in Tret\u0101-yuga, and V\u0101sudeva and Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a in Dv\u0101para-yuga, similar names are not given for Kali-yuga, although such names exist, in order to avoid disclosing cheaply the truth of the incarnation of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. In Kali-yuga human society is infested with hypocrisy and superficiality. There is a strong tendency toward imitation and fraud in this age. Therefore the incarnation of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is revealed in Vedic literature in a confidential, discrete way, so that it will be known to the authorized persons who can then propagate the mission of the Lord on the earth. We actually see in this modern age that many foolish and ordinary persons claim to be God or incarnations, avat\u0101ras, etc. There are many cheap philosophies and academies that promise, for a moderate fee, to make one God in a short time. In America one famous religious group promises its followers that they will all become the Supreme Lord in heaven. Such bogus preaching goes on in the name of Christianity. Thus, were Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s name widely spoken of in Vedic literature, there would soon be a veritable plague of imitation Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhus infesting the world. Therefore, to prevent this pandemonium, discretion is exercised in the Vedic literatures in Kali-yuga, and in a sober, concealed way the actual followers of Vedic culture are informed through the Vedic mantras of the descent of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. This discrete system, selected by the Lord Himself for His appearance in Kali-yuga, is proving to be greatly successful on the earth planet. And throughout the world millions of people are chanting the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without the unbearable harassment of hundreds and thousands of imitation Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhus. Those who seriously desire to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead can easily understand the Lord\u2019s mission, whereas cynical materialistic rascals, puffed up by false prestige and madly considering their insignificant intelligence to be greater than the intelligence of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, cannot understand the beautiful arrangements made by the Lord for His graceful descent into the material world. Thus, although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is \u015breyas\u0101m \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25, or the Lord of all benedictions, such foolish persons turn away from the Lord\u2019s mission and in this way deprive themselves of their own true benefit in life."

        "translation": "Those who are actually advanced in knowledge are able to appreciate the essential value of this Age of Kali. Such enlightened persons worship Kali-yuga because in this fallen age all perfection of life can easily be achieved by the performance of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana.",
        "purport": " It is stated here that among the four ages \u2014 Satya, Tret\u0101, Dv\u0101para and Kali \u2014 Kali-yuga is actually the best because in this age the Lord mercifully distributes the highest perfection of consciousness, namely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, very freely. The word \u0101rya has been defined by \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da as \u201cone who is advancing spiritually.\u201d The nature of an advanced person is to search for the essence of life. For example, the essence of the material body is not the body itself but the spirit soul that is within the body; therefore an intelligent person gives more attention to the eternal spirit soul than to the temporary body. Similarly, although Kali-yuga is considered to be an ocean of contamination, there is also an ocean of good fortune in Kali-yuga, namely the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement. In other words, all of the degraded qualities of this age are completely counteracted by the process of chanting the holy names of the Lord. Thus it is stated in the Vedic language, \u201cWhatever is achieved in Satya-yuga by meditation, in Tret\u0101 by offering ritual sacrifices and in Dv\u0101para by temple worship is achieved in Kali-yuga by chanting the names of Lord Ke\u015bava congregationally.\u201d The Vedic process gradually lifts the conditioned entity out of the darkness of aha\u1e45k\u0101ra, or false identification with the gross material body, and brings him to the platform of self-realization, or aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi, \u201cI am spirit soul. I am eternal.\u201d One has to make further progress to discover that although one is eternal, there is a superior eternal entity, who is the Lord Himself within one\u2019s own heart and within every atom in the material universe. Beyond this second phase of self-realization there is the third and final stage of perfection, which is realization of Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His own abode. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not primarily the superintendent of this world but rather the enjoyer of His own world, which is beyond the most fantastic dreams of the conditioned living entity. In other words, although the king or president of a country is ultimately the controller of the prison department, the king or president derives actual pleasure within his own palace and not in administering justice to the foolish prisoners. Similarly, the Lord appoints the demigods to administer the material creation on His behalf while He Himself personally enjoys the ocean of transcendental bliss in His own transcendental kingdom. Thus, realization of the Lord within His own kingdom is far superior to the primitive understanding that the Lord is the \u201ccreator\u201d of the prison of the material world. This realization of Bhagav\u0101n begins with understanding that there are innumerable Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets in the spiritual sky and that on each of them a particular expansion of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a dwells with His innumerable devotees who are attached to that particular form. The central and chief planet in the spiritual sky is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, and there the Personality of Godhead exhibits His supreme and original form of Govinda. As confirmed by Lord Brahm\u0101, govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi. Lord Brahm\u0101 also states: Thus, love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and entrance into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s planet in the spiritual sky is the most supremely perfect and exalted status of life available anywhere, at any time, throughout the totality of existence. That perfection is available in Kali-yuga simply by chanting the holy names of God: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Therefore every sane man, woman or child should deeply understand the unprecedented opportunity offered by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and seriously take up this chanting process. Only the most unfortunate and irrational person will neglect this transcendental opportunity."

        "translation": "Indeed, there is no higher possible gain for embodied souls forced to wander throughout the material world than the Supreme Lord\u2019s sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement, by which one can attain the supreme peace and free oneself from the cycle of repeated birth and death.",
        "purport": " In the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a, as well as in other Pur\u0101\u1e47as, there is the following statement: mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavat\u0101 nitya\u1e41 kalau kurvanti k\u012brtanam. \u201cDuring Kali-yuga the great devotees of the Lord always engage in k\u012brtana, chanting the Lord\u2019s holy names.\u201d It is the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be merciful, and He is especially merciful to those who, in a helpless condition, take complete shelter of His lotus feet. One can immediately take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord by chanting His holy names. According to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, even in previous ages such as Satya-yuga it was not possible for the living entities to achieve the perfection that is available in Kali-yuga. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has explained this as follows. In former ages such as Satya-yuga human beings were perfectly qualified and easily performed even the most difficult spiritual processes, meditating for many thousands of years practically without eating or sleeping. Thus, although in any age one who completely takes shelter of the Lord\u2019s holy name gets all perfection, the highly qualified inhabitants of Satya-yuga do not consider that merely moving the tongue and lips, chanting the Lord\u2019s holy name, is a complete process and that the Lord\u2019s holy name is the only shelter within the universe. They are more attracted to the difficult and elaborate yoga system of meditation, complete with sophisticated sitting postures, painstaking control of the breath and deep, extended meditations in trance on the Personality of Godhead within the heart. In Satya-yuga sinful life is practically unheard of, and therefore people are not afflicted with the terrible reactions seen in Kali-yuga, such as world war, famine, plague, drought, insanity, etc. Although in Satya-yuga people always worship the Personality of Godhead as the ultimate goal of life and meticulously follow His laws, called dharma, they do not feel themselves to be in a helpless condition, and thus they do not always experience intense love for the Lord. However, in Kali-yuga living conditions are so unbearable, modern governments are so obnoxious, our bodies are so ridden by physical and mental disease, and even self-preservation is so troublesome, that the conditioned souls intensely cry out the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, begging for relief from the onslaught of this age. The members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement have vivid and unforgettable experiences of the terrible contradictions inherent in human society in this age, and thus they are firmly convinced that there is nothing to be achieved except the mercy of the Supreme Lord. In ISKCON centers throughout the world we observe wonderfully ecstatic k\u012brtana performances in which men, women and children from all walks of life chant with startling enthusiasm the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and dance in ecstasy, becoming completely indifferent to so-called public opinion. In America a prominent professor from Oberlin College visited a Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a center in California and was astonished by the enthusiasm with which the devotees chant the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in their congregational performances. Thus, due to their helpless and pathetic condition, the living entities in Kali-yuga have great impetus to surrender fully to the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, putting all of their hope and faith in the Lord\u2019s holy name. Kali-yuga is therefore the best age because in this age, more than in Satya-yuga or other ages, the conditioned souls become disgusted with the kingdom of illusion and surrender fully to the Lord\u2019s holy name. This status of full surrender is called param\u0101\u1e41 \u015b\u0101ntim, or supreme peace. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted a passage from the book called Sv\u0101bh\u0101vya to the effect that a bona fide spiritual master in disciplic succession is able to understand the mentality and capability of his disciples and engage them in worshiping the particular form of the Lord suitable for them. In this way the spiritual master destroys all obstacles in the path of his disciples. The general rule is that one must worship the particular form of the Lord that appears in the current yuga. One may also offer his love and worship to other forms of the Lord that appear in other ages, and specifically one is recommended to chant the holy names of Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva to get all protection. Practically all of these injunctions are being carried out within the ISKCON movement. Within the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness society, men, women and children are all being engaged in worshiping the Lord according to their particular natures. In addition, according to Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s order, we are worshiping Balar\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who appeared in Dv\u0101para-yuga, because They are the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, by chanting the Da\u015b\u0101vat\u0101ra-stotra, jaya jagad-\u012b\u015ba hare, and by reading \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the members of ISKCON worship all of the plenary expansions of the Personality of Godhead. And after every \u0101rati performance devotional prayers are duly chanted to Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva for protection of this movement, which is so essential to human society."

        "translation": "My dear King, the inhabitants of Satya-yuga and other ages eagerly desire to take birth in this Age of Kali, since in this age there will be many devotees of the Supreme Lord, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. These devotees will appear in various places but will be especially numerous in South India. O master of men, in the Age of Kali those persons who drink the waters of the holy rivers of Dravi\u1e0da-de\u015ba, such as the T\u0101mrapar\u1e47\u012b, Krtam\u0101l\u0101, Payasvin\u012b, the extremely pious K\u0101ver\u012b and the Prat\u012bc\u012b Mah\u0101nad\u012b, will almost all be purehearted devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva.",
        "purport": " The Vedas contain information of past, present and future living conditions throughout the universe. This is not very wonderful. For example, although at present time in India we are experiencing spring weather, we know that in the future the torrid summer will come, followed by the rainy season, autumn and eventually winter and a new spring. Similarly, we know that these seasons have occurred repeatedly in the past. Thus, just as ordinary human beings can understand the past, present and future seasons of the earth, the liberated followers of Vedic culture can easily understand the past, present and future conditions of the seasonal ages of the earth and other planets. The inhabitants of Satya-yuga are certainly aware of the conditions of Kali-yuga. They know that in Kali-yuga the difficult material situation forces the living entity to take complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that the inhabitants of Kali-yuga therefore develop a high degree of love of Godhead. Therefore although the inhabitants of Satya-yuga are far more sinless, truthful and self-controlled than the people of other ages, they desire to take birth in Kali-yuga in order to taste pure love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without associating with the devotees of the Lord no one can become an advanced devotee of the Lord. Therefore, since in Kali-yuga other Vedic processes collapse due to the unfavorable condition, and since the only authorized Vedic process is the devotional chanting of the Lord\u2019s holy name, which is available to everyone, there will undoubtedly be innumerable Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, or devotees of the Lord, in this age. Birth in this age is very favorable for one who is eager to associate with the devotees. In fact, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is establishing authorized Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava temples throughout the world so that in innumerable areas one may avail himself of association with pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Association with the devotees of the Lord is far more valuable than any amount of association with persons who are merely self-controlled, sinless or expert in Vedic scholarship. Therefore it is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (6.14.5): \u201cO great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, one may be a devotee of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare.\u201d Similarly, it is stated in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.54): \u201cThe verdict of all revealed scriptures is that by even a moment\u2019s association with a pure devotee, one can attain all success.\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b the words kvacit kvacit in this verse indicate that in Kali-yuga Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Caitanya will appear in Gau\u1e0da-de\u015ba, in the district of Nadia. And from this pivotal point, He will gradually expand the flood of love of Godhead to cover the entire earth. Many exalted devotees such as \u015ar\u012b Advait\u0101c\u0101rya also take birth in Gau\u1e0da-de\u015ba. The process of chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-k\u012brtana, is not limited to Kali-yuga. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-dharma, in relation to the story of the fallen son of a k\u1e63atriya, it is stated: \u201cThere is no restriction of place or time, nor any injunction forbidding the accepting of remnants of foods, etc., when one has become greedy to chant the name of \u015ar\u012b Hari.\u201d Similarly, it is stated in the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-dharma and the Vai\u015b\u0101kha-m\u0101h\u0101tmya section of the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, cakr\u0101yudhasya n\u0101m\u0101ni sad\u0101 sarvatra k\u012brtayet: \u201cThe names of the Supreme Lord who has the disc as His weapon should be glorified always and everywhere.\u201d Similarly, the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a states: \u201cThe name of the Lord need not be chanted with regard to place, time, circumstantial conditions, preliminary self-purification or any other factors. Rather, it is completely independent of all other processes and rewards all the desires of those who eagerly chant it.\u201d Similarly, it is stated in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-dharma: \u201cFor one who has Lord Govinda in his heart, Satya-yuga becomes manifest in the midst of Kali, and conversely even Satya-yuga becomes Kali-yuga for one who does not have the infallible Lord in his heart.\u201d The holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is potent everywhere, at all times and in all circumstances; therefore one should always chant the holy names of the Lord, either in Kali-yuga, Satya-yuga, in heaven, in hell or in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s holy name is eternally nondifferent from Him, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is eternally the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, it is not that the holy name is powerful in this age only because other processes are not effective. It is also stated in the \u015ar\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a that chanting the holy names of the Lord is far more potent than simply trying to remember the Lord through meditation. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.1.11), \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated: \u201cO King, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord after the ways of the great authorities is the doubtless and fearless way of success for all, including those who are free from all material desires, those who are desirous of all material enjoyment, and also those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge.\u201d In his commentary on this verse in the Bh\u0101gavatam, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has written: \u201cAccording to \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, this way of attaining success [chanting the holy name] is an established fact, concluded not only by him, but also by all other previous \u0101c\u0101ryas. Therefore there is no need of further evidence.\u201d The reader may consult \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da\u2019s purport to this verse for a detailed explanation of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord and the offenses to be avoided in such chanting. In the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-cint\u0101ma\u1e47i there is the following statement: \u201cAlthough capable of destroying all sins, the remembrance of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is achieved only with extraordinary effort. On the other hand, one may perform k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-k\u012brtana simply by moving one\u2019s lips, and thus this process is superior.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has also quoted the following verse: \u201cO descendant of Bharata, the holy names of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are always vibrating in the mouth of one who has previously worshiped V\u0101sudeva perfectly for hundreds of lifetimes.\u201d The same idea is conveyed in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam by \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Devah\u016bti in her statement to her son, Kapila: \u201cOh, how glorious are they whose tongues are chanting Your holy name! Even if born in the families of dog-eaters, such persons are worshipable. Persons who chant the holy name of Your Lordship must have executed all kinds of austerities and fire sacrifices and achieved all the good manners of the \u0100ryans. To be chanting the holy name of Your Lordship, they must have bathed at holy places of pilgrimage, studied the Vedas and fulfilled everything required.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.33.7) Therefore, \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has concluded that it is possible to perform k\u012brtana equally in all ages. In Kali-yuga, however, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His causeless mercy, personally induces the living entities to take the holy name. Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has thus quoted the Lord as follows: \u201cO conditioned souls who are foolishly sleeping on the lap of the witch M\u0101y\u0101, I have brought an excellent medicine to cure the disease of your illusion. This medicine is called hari-n\u0101ma. It is My holy name, and by taking this medicine you will get all perfection in life. Therefore, I sincerely request you to please take this medicine that I have personally brought for you.\u201d In verse 32 of this chapter it was stated, yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi su-medhasa\u1e25. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b the words sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yai\u1e25, which mean \u201cmainly by the process of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana,\u201d indicate that although other processes such as Deity worship may be performed to some extent in Kali-yuga, such processes, in order to be successful, must be favorably connected with the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. One who is performing worship of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Deity should know that the most essential part of such Deity worship is constant chanting of the holy names of the Lord. On the other hand, one who has perfectly chanted the holy name of the Lord need not depend on other processes, as expressed in the following famous mantra: \u201cIn this Age of Kali there is no alternative, there is no alternative, there is no alternative for spiritual progress other than the holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord.\u201d (B\u1e5bhan-n\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a 38.126) As proved by all of these evidences, the statement in the Bh\u0101gavatam (kali\u1e41 sabh\u0101jayanty \u0101ry\u0101\u1e25) that spiritually advanced persons worship the Age of Kali due to the facilities offered in this age by the Lord is not at all contradictory. At the end of verse 40 in this chapter it is stated, pr\u0101yo bhakt\u0101 bhagavati v\u0101sudeve\u00a0\u2019mal\u0101\u015bay\u0101\u1e25: in general those who are able to regularly drink the waters of the holy rivers of South India will be pure-hearted devotees of Lord V\u0101sudeva. The word pr\u0101ya\u1e25, or \u201cin general,\u201d indicates that those who are offensive to the Lord\u2019s devotees, although claiming themselves to be devotees, are not included within the list of amal\u0101\u015bay\u0101\u1e25, or purehearted souls. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that one should not be bewildered by seeing the apparently poverty-stricken condition of the inhabitants of South India. Even nowadays the inhabitants of the places mentioned in this verse generally spend their days with meager eating and clothing and live as great renounced devotees of the Supreme Lord. In other words, clothes do not make the man. To live as a polished animal, dressing oneself luxuriously and gratifying the tongue with rich foodstuffs, is not the actual symptom of an advanced transcendentalist. Although the residents of South India are generally \u015ar\u012b Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, or devotees in the Lak\u1e63m\u012b samprad\u0101ya, they are recognized as devotees of the Lord by the followers of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, their austere living conditions should be taken as a good qualification, not a disqualification."

        "translation": "O King, one who has given up all material duties and has taken full shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, who offers shelter to all, is not indebted to the demigods, great sages, ordinary living beings, relatives, friends, mankind or even one\u2019s forefathers who have passed away. Since all such classes of living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, one who has surrendered to the Lord\u2019s service has no need to serve such persons separately.",
        "purport": " One who has not fully surrendered to the devotional service of the Lord undoubtedly has many material duties to perform. Every ordinary conditioned soul is the recipient of innumerable benefits given by the demigods, who provide sun and moonshine, rain, wind, food and, ultimately, one\u2019s own material body. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated, stena eva sa\u1e25: one who does not reciprocate with the demigods by offering them sacrifice is stena, or a thief. Similarly, other living entities such as cows are providing us with innumerable delicious and nutritious foodstuffs. When we wake up in the morning our mind is refreshed by the sweet singing of birds, and on a hot day we enjoy the cool shade and breeze of the forest trees. We are accepting service from innumerable living entities, and we are obligated to repay them. \u0100pta means one\u2019s own family members, to whom one is certainly obligated according to normal morality, and n\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101m means human society. Until one becomes a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is certainly a product of his society. We receive mundane education, culture, tradition and protection from the society in which we live, and thus we owe a great debt to society. Of course, our debt to society is not simply to the present order but to all of our forefathers and ancestors who carefully preserved moral and social customs so that we, their descendants, could live peacefully. Therefore the word pit\u1e5d\u1e47\u0101m, or \u201cforefathers,\u201d indicates our debt to previous generations. In fact, the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness society are sometimes criticized by materialistic persons for giving too much attention to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a rather than working to fulfill all of the above-mentioned obligations. In reply to this, the Bh\u0101gavatam (4.31.14) states, yath\u0101 taror m\u016bla-ni\u1e63ecanena t\u1e5bpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopa\u015b\u0101kh\u0101\u1e25. If one waters the root of a tree, automatically all of the branches, twigs, leaves, etc., are also nourished. There is no need for, nor any effectiveness in, separately pouring water on the branches, twigs and leaves of a tree. The water has to be placed on the root. Similarly, pr\u0101\u1e47opah\u0101r\u0101c ca yathendriy\u0101\u1e47\u0101m: food must be placed in the stomach, from where it is automatically distributed to all of the limbs of the body. It is foolish to try to nourish the whole body by rubbing food separately on all the bodily limbs. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the source of all existence. Everything is emanating from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, everything is maintained by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and at the end, everything will merge to rest in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the supreme benefactor, friend, protector and well-wisher of every living entity, and if He is satisfied, then automatically the whole world will become satisfied, just as all of the bodily limbs are strengthened and satisfied when food is duly remitted to the stomach. The example can be given that a man who is working as the personal secretary to a great king has no further obligation to petty minor kings. Undoubtedly an ordinary person has many obligations within this material world. But according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, mayaiva vihit\u0101n hi t\u0101n: it is actually the Supreme Lord who is giving all benedictions. For example, one receives one\u2019s body by the mercy of one\u2019s parents. However, sometimes we find that a particular man or woman may become impotent at a given moment. Sometimes a deformed child is born, and sometimes a child is born dead. Often the sexual act fails to produce pregnancy at all. So although all parents desire a beautiful, highly qualified child, this is often not the case. Thus it can be understood that ultimately it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that a man and woman are able to produce a child by the sexual act. It is by the Lord\u2019s mercy that the man\u2019s seminal injection is potent and the woman\u2019s ovum is fertile. Similarly, it is only by the mercy of the Lord that the child is born in a healthy condition and reaches physical maturity to pursue his own life. If at any stage in the evolution of a human being the Lord\u2019s mercy is withdrawn, sudden death or crippling disease occurs. The demigods are also not independent. The words parih\u1e5btya kartam, \u201cgiving up other duties,\u201d indicate that one should give up any concept that the demigods are separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is clearly stated in Vedic literature that the demigods are different limbs of the universal body of the Supreme Lord. Further, it is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart and that He only is giving intelligence and memory. Thus, our forefathers who carefully preserved cultural traditions were acting with intelligence provided by the Supreme Lord. They certainly were not acting with their own independent intelligence. No one can be intelligent without a brain, and it is only by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy that we receive a human brain. Therefore, if we carefully analyze all of our multifarious obligations toward different classes of living entities, we shall find that in each and every case it is ultimately by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that we have received a particular benediction in life. So although an ordinary person must methodically fulfill all of his various obligations by executing different types of sacrifices and charitable activities for the satisfaction of those who have benefited him, one who is directly serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, at once fulfills all such obligations because all benedictions ultimately have come from the Lord through the agency of family, forefathers, demigods, etc. The example may be given that sometimes a state government may distribute benefits originally provided by the federal government. So one who becomes the personal secretary or minister to the chief executive of the federal government has no further obligation to the less important representatives of the state government. Therefore, it is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.20.9): \u201cAs long as one is not satiated by fruitive activity and has not awakened his taste for devotional service by hearing and chanting about the Supreme Lord, one has to act according to the regulative principles of the Vedic injunctions.\u201d The conclusion is that one who has fully surrendered to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord is a first-class human being. People in general are only eager to receive benedictions from demigods, family members and society because such benedictions are conducive to material sense gratification. Less intelligent persons consider such material progress to be the only goal of life and thus cannot appreciate the exalted position of pure devotional service to the Lord. Bhakti-yoga, or pure devotional service, is meant to directly please the senses of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Envious materialistic persons propose various arguments to deny that the Supreme Lord even has transcendental senses. The devotees, however, do not waste time doubting the inconceivable beauty, strength, wealth and geniality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but directly please the Lord\u2019s senses through loving service and thus receive the supreme benediction of going back home, back to Godhead. The devotees return to the Lord\u2019s abode, where life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. No demigod, family member or forefather can give one an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. However, if one foolishly neglects the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and instead accepts the temporary material body to be everything, then one must certainly perform elaborate sacrifices, austerities and charity and fulfill all of the obligations mentioned above. Otherwise, one becomes completely sinful and condemned, even from the material point of view."

        "translation": "One who has thus given up all other engagements and has taken full shelter at the lotus feet of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is very dear to the Lord. Indeed, if such a surrendered soul accidentally commits some sinful activity, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated within everyone\u2019s heart, immediately takes away the reaction to such sin.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse it was clearly described that a fully surrendered devotee of the Supreme Lord has no need to perform ordinary, worldly duties. Now in this verse it is revealed that devotional service is so pure and potent that a surrendered devotee of the Lord has no need to perform any other purificatory process. As described in the Sixth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, a surrendered devotee has no need to perform pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta, or atonement for an accidental falldown into sinful activity. Since devotional service is itself the most purifying process, a sincere devotee who has accidentally stumbled on the path should immediately resume his pure devotional service at the lotus feet of the Lord. And thus the Lord will protect him, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.30): The word tyakt\u0101nya-bh\u0101vasya in this verse is very significant. As stated in the previous verse, a pure devotee realizes clearly that all living entities, including Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus have no separate or independent existence. Realizing that everything and everyone is part and parcel of the Lord, a devotee automatically is not inclined to commit sinful activities by violating the order of God. However, due to the powerful influence of material nature, even a sincere devotee may be temporarily overwhelmed by illusion and deviate from the rigid path of pure devotional service. In such a case, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, acting within the heart, removes such sinful activities. Even Yamar\u0101ja, the lord of death, has no power to punish a surrendered devotee who has accidentally committed sinful activities. As stated here, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is pare\u015ba, or the Supreme Lord, and all secondary lords such as the demigods cannot threaten the Lord\u2019s personal devotees. In his youth Aj\u0101mila had been a pious br\u0101hma\u1e47a engaged in the service of the Lord. Then, by bad association with a prostitute, he became practically the most degraded man in the world. At the end of his life, Yamar\u0101ja sent his Yamad\u016btas to drag away the soul of the sinful Aj\u0101mila, but the Personality of Godhead immediately sent His personal associates to save Aj\u0101mila and demonstrate to Yamar\u0101ja that no secondary personality can disturb the personal devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati. The argument may be raised that the sm\u1e5bti-\u015b\u0101stra states, \u015bruti-sm\u1e5bt\u012b mamaiv\u0101j\u00f1e: the Vedic scriptures are the direct orders of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, one may ask, how can the Lord tolerate that His orders be occasionally neglected, even by His devotees? To answer this possible objection, the word priyasya is used in this verse. The devotees of the Lord are very dear to the Lord. Although the beloved child may accidentally commit an abominable activity, the loving father forgives the child, taking into consideration the actual good intentions of the child. Thus, although the devotee of the Lord does not try to exploit the Lord\u2019s mercy by requesting the Lord to free him from any future suffering, the Lord, by His own initiative, frees the devotee from the reactions to accidental falldowns. This causeless mercy of the Lord upon His devotee is His paramai\u015bvaryam, or supreme opulence. Gradually the faithful devotee becomes free, even from accidental falldown, because simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Lord, what to speak of by actively rendering service to Him, his heart is purified. Although the surrendered devotees of the Personality of Godhead may sometimes appear to be affected by mundane attitudes, they are inevitably protected by the merciful Lord and are never actually defeated in life."

Actually, Vasudeva was already a personal associate of the Supreme Lord, but due to his natural humility as a great devotee, he was determined to perfect his love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus we can observe the exalted status of the parents of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ordinary persons feel that the Supreme Lord is always to be worshiped as the supreme father who supplies everything for the living entities. Such an attitude is not the perfection of love of Godhead, because when a son is young he is incapable of giving much service to his mother and father. When the child is very young, it is rather the parents who are constantly serving the child. So when the devotee takes the role of mother or father of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is unlimited opportunity for rendering loving service to the Lord, whom the devotee ecstatically accepts as his son. It was Vasudeva\u2019s good fortune that N\u0101rada Muni personally revealed to him the wonderful teachings given by the nava-yogendras long, long ago to the saintly King Nimi."

        "translation": "My dear Vasudeva, you and your good wife Devak\u012b have manifested great transcendental love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, accepting Him as your son. Indeed, you are always seeing the Lord, embracing Him, speaking with Him, resting with Him, sitting together with Him and taking your meals with Him. By such affectionate and intimate association with the Lord, undoubtedly both of you have completely purified your hearts. In other words, you are already perfect.",
        "purport": " The words \u0101tm\u0101 v\u0101m p\u0101vita\u1e25 in this verse are very significant. Ordinary conditioned souls are required to purify their existence by practicing the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga and learning how to offer all of their activities in the devotional service of the Lord. Such a regulative, gradual process, however, cannot be applied to those exalted souls who are personally attending the Lord as His parents, boyfriends, girlfriends, advisors, sons, etc. Due to Vasudeva and Devak\u012b\u2019s intense love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as their son, they had already achieved the highest perfectional stage of life. Although in the previous verse \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni informed Vasudeva that he and his wife had become glorious by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s taking birth as their son, Vasudeva might have argued that other personal associates of the Lord, such as Jaya and Vijaya, had fallen down due to offending the br\u0101hma\u1e47a class. Therefore, in the present verse N\u0101rada has used the word p\u0101vita\u1e25: \u201cYou are completely purified, and therefore you are completely free from the slightest trace of discrepancy in your devotional service, due to your intense love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d It is understood from the commentary of \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura that \u015ar\u012b Vasudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastime father, is actually an eternally liberated nitya-siddha associate of the Personality of Godhead. Vasudeva has a spiritual body, just as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does, and he is always merged in the overwhelming ecstatic desire to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his beautiful son. However, N\u0101rada could understand that due to extreme humility, Vasudeva considered himself an ordinary human being and was feeling very anxious to receive transcendental instructions on the devotional service of the Lord. Accepting the ecstatic humility of Vasudeva, and to relieve his anxiety, \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni instructed him in the science of bhakti-yoga as one might instruct an ordinary human being. However, at the same time N\u0101rada has revealed that actually \u015ar\u012b Vasudeva and Devak\u012b are already completely glorious by their unprecedented fortune of having K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma as their sons. Therefore, N\u0101rada is telling Vasudeva, \u201cMy dear Vasudeva, do not in any way be discouraged or doubtful about your position. Undoubtedly you are immediately going back home, back to Godhead. And actually you and your good wife are the most fortunate persons.\u201d In conclusion, everyone should become fortunate by fully developing his dormant love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Many terrible demons who opposed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a eventually achieved a happy state of life by their association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore there is no doubt about the supreme bliss achieved by the loving devotees of the Lord who day and night can only think of pleasing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

Even while they were lying down, sitting or engaging in other activities, they enviously meditated upon the bodily movements of the Lord, His sporting pastimes, His loving glances upon His devotees, and other attractive features displayed by the Lord. Being thus always absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they achieved spiritual liberation in the Lord\u2019s own abode. What then can be said of the benedictions offered to those who constantly fix their minds on Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a favorable, loving mood?",
        "purport": " On the eve of the disappearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from this world, Vasudeva became filled with lamentation thinking that he had not properly utilized the opportunity of the Lord\u2019s personal presence to become perfectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. However, N\u0101rada Muni assured \u015ar\u012b Vasudeva that the glories of Vasudeva and his good wife Devak\u012b were chanted throughout the universe because even the demigods worshiped the exalted status of the Lord\u2019s own parents. Vasudeva was not only concerned about his own spiritual position, but he also lamented for the Yadu dynasty, which had left the world in an apparently inauspicious way, being cursed by great br\u0101hma\u1e47as such as N\u0101rada and dying in a fratricidal war. Although the members of the Yadu dynasty were personal associates of the Lord, their disappearance from the earth was apparently inauspicious, and therefore Vasudeva was concerned about their eventual destination. So N\u0101rada here assures Vasudeva that even the demons who opposed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, such as \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la, Pau\u1e47\u1e0draka and \u015a\u0101lva, achieved promotion to the Lord\u2019s own abode because of their constant absorption in thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore what to speak of the exalted members of the Yadu dynasty who actually loved K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a more than anything (anurakta-dhiy\u0101\u1e41 puna\u1e25 kim)? Similarly, it is stated in the Garu\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cEven foolish sinners like \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la and Duryodhana who showered abuse upon the Lord were cleansed of all sins simply by remembering Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Somehow or other their minds were absorbed in the Lord, and thus they attained liberation. What doubt then is there about the destination of those who are overwhelmed with devotional feelings for the Lord?\u201d Vasudeva was also feeling anxiety because on the one hand he was aware that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but at the same time he treated the Lord as his beloved son. In the relationship between the father and son, sometimes the father must chastise the son and restrict him in various ways. In this way Vasudeva was feeling that undoubtedly he had offended the Lord in his attempt to train Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his son. However, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually pleased when a pure devotee becomes absorbed in parental love for Him and thus devotedly tries to care for Him just as loving parents care for a small child. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reciprocates the intense devotional feelings of such devotees by actually appearing before them as a young boy and acting just like their son. As mentioned in this verse, the demons actually chastised K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with feelings of enmity. Nevertheless, such demons attained liberation due to their absorption in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, what to speak of the destination of Vasudeva, who chastised K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a due to his overwhelming parental love for Him? The conclusion is that the devotees of the Lord should never consider Vasudeva and Devak\u012b to be ordinary, conditioned souls. Their relationship with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is completely on the transcendental platform of v\u0101tsalya-rasa, or parental love for the Personality of Godhead. It has nothing to do with the parental love of the material world, which is based on a mood of sense gratification, since the parents see their children as objects of material enjoyment."

        "purport": " Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original source of all plenary incarnations of the Absolute Truth. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam. His unlimited transcendental opulences are inexhaustible, and thus He very easily brings the entire creation under His personal control. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the eternal well-wisher of every living entity, so there was no need for Vasudeva to be anxious about his future destination, nor that of the other personal associates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, such as the members of the Yadu dynasty. In verse 46 of this chapter, N\u0101rada Muni told Vasudeva, putrat\u0101m agamad yad v\u0101\u1e41 bhagav\u0101n \u012b\u015bvaro hari\u1e25: \u201cYou and your good wife are now glorified throughout the universe because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has personally become your son.\u201d In this way N\u0101rada is encouraging Vasudeva to continue to love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his most beloved son, for such ecstatic devotional feelings are never to be given up. But at the same time, N\u0101rada is removing Vasudeva\u2019s doubts about the future by assuring him, \u201cDue to your love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a you may think that He is an ordinary human being. You are appearing like a human being, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is simply reciprocating with you. In order to encourage you to love Him as your son, He is placing Himself under your control. And thus, His inconceivable power and opulences are being concealed from you. Don\u2019t assume, however, that there is actually a dangerous situation because of the events of this material world. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears to be under your control, He is eternally the supreme controller. Therefore, do not consider Him to be a human being. He is always the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d The word m\u0101y\u0101 in this verse indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s manu\u1e63ya, or humanlike, activities are actually misleading to the ordinary man because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. M\u0101y\u0101 also means \u201ctranscendental potencies.\u201d As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sambhav\u0101my \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101: the Lord descends in His own transcendental form filled with transcendental potencies. And thus the words m\u0101y\u0101-manu\u1e63ya-bh\u0101vena here also indicate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s original transcendental form, which resembles the humanlike forms experienced in this world. M\u0101y\u0101 also indicates \u201cmercy,\u201d or \u201ccompassion,\u201d according to the Sanskrit dictionary, and thus the Lord\u2019s incarnation is understood to be His causeless mercy upon the conditioned souls. The Lord\u2019s descent is also His causeless mercy upon the liberated souls, who take immense pleasure in joining the Lord in His pastimes and in chanting and hearing about such exalted spiritual activities (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25). In order to reciprocate the love of Vasudeva for Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mostly concealed His unlimited opulences. In this way the devotee is fully encouraged in his particular loving relationship with the Lord. However, when Vasudeva was filled with anxiety due to the dangerous situation created by the br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s curse, N\u0101rada immediately reminded him that such anxiety was unnecessary, since all these events were under the direct control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava paramaha\u1e41sas who take the position of the Lord\u2019s parents remain under the shelter of the Lord at all times and never deviate from the loving devotional service of the Lord. They remain fixed in transcendence in all circumstances, unlike ordinary parents of the material world, who are constantly becoming bewildered by illusion due to the bodily concept of life."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead descended to kill the demoniac kings who were the burden of the earth and to protect the saintly devotees. However, both the demons and the devotees are awarded liberation by the Lord\u2019s mercy. Thus, His transcendental fame has spread throughout the universe.",
        "purport": " A doubt may arise as to how the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends to this material world. And since He is the omnipotent creator of millions of universes, why do the devotees glorify as wonderful the Lord\u2019s activities such as His killing a witch named P\u016btan\u0101 by sucking out her life through her breast? Although such activities are certainly beyond the scope of ordinary human beings, why should they be considered wonderful when executed by the omnipotent Personality of Godhead? The answer is given in this verse by the word nirv\u1e5btyai. The Lord killed the demons not because He was envious of them, but in order to give them spiritual liberation. Thus the causeless mercy of the Personality of Godhead in liberating both the devotees and the demons by His inconceivable pastimes clearly distinguishes the Lord from any other living entity, either man or demigod. It is stated, mukti-prad\u0101t\u0101 sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47ur eva na sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25: only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can give liberation beyond birth and death. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has pointed out that generally the demons are awarded impersonal liberation in the Brahman effulgence, whereas the devotees are given the superior benediction of love of Godhead in the spiritual planets. Thus, the Lord exhibits His causeless mercy toward all classes of living entities, and His fame is spread throughout the universe. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental, His fame is not different from His personal incarnation, so as the Lord\u2019s fame expands, the entire universe is gradually liberated. These are some of the unique characteristics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
