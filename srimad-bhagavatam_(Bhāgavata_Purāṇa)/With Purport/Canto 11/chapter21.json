Devotional service, based on hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, directly engages the conditioned soul in the Lord\u2019s loving service and thus is the most efficient means of achieving the Lord. All three processes, however, share a common goal, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Now the Lord describes those who, being completely absorbed in material sense gratification, do not adopt any authorized means to achieve the Lord\u2019s mercy. Currently, hundreds of millions of unfortunate human beings fit squarely into this category and, as described here, perpetually suffer the bondage of material existence."

        "purport": " In the previous verse Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explained that the path of spiritual progress begins with working without fruitive desires, advances to the stage of realized spiritual knowledge, and culminates in direct engagement in the devotional service of the Lord. Here the Lord emphasizes that a conditioned soul should not artificially disrupt the natural evolution of his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by deviating from those duties prescribed by the Lord Himself. In the lower stages of human life one is entangled in false identification with the gross material body and desires to execute material fruitive activities based on society, friendship and love. When such materialistic activities are offered in sacrifice to the Supreme Lord, one becomes situated in karma-yoga. By regulated sacrifice one gradually gives up the gross bodily concept of life and advances to the stage of realization of spiritual knowledge, whereby one understands oneself to be an eternal spirit soul completely different from the material body and mind. Feeling relief from the pangs of materialism one becomes very attached to one\u2019s spiritual knowledge, and thus one is situated in the stage of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. As the candidate further advances on the spiritual path, he understands himself to be part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He then sees that his conditional life as well as his spiritual knowledge was obtained from the Personality of Godhead, who awards the results of all types of activities, both pious and sinful. By directly engaging in the loving service of the Supreme Lord and understanding oneself to be the Lord\u2019s eternal servant, one\u2019s attachment evolves into pure love of Godhead. Thus one first gives up the lower stage of attachment to the material body and then subsequently gives up attachment to cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This relieves one of material life. Finally one recognizes the Lord Himself as the resting place of one\u2019s eternal love and fully surrenders to God in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains in this verse that one who is still attached to the material body and mind cannot artificially give up the prescribed duties of karma-yoga. In the same way, one who is a spiritual neophyte, just beginning to realize the illusion of material life, should not artificially try to think of the Lord\u2019s intimate pastimes twenty-four hours a day, imitating the stage of prema-bhakti. Rather, he should cultivate analytic knowledge of the material world, by which one gives up attachment to the material body and mind. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam we find many analytic descriptions of the material world, and they can free the conditioned soul from false identification with matter. One who has achieved the perfect stage of love of Godhead, however, being freed from all gross and subtle attachments to the material world, may give up the lower stages of karma-yoga and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and engage directly in the Lord\u2019s loving service. In Chapter Nineteen, verse 45, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states, gu\u1e47a-do\u1e63a-d\u1e5b\u015bir do\u1e63o gu\u1e47as t\u016bbhaya-varjita\u1e25. One should not see material good and evil within a devotee of the Lord. Indeed, one becomes pious by giving up such mundane conceptions. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura points out that occasionally a neophyte devotee may be polluted by association with those enthusiastically executing fruitive activities and mental speculation. Such a devotee\u2019s religious activities may be affected by mundane tendencies. Similarly, an ordinary person who observes the exalted status of a pure devotee sometimes externally imitates the devotee\u2019s activities, considering himself to be on the same exalted platform of pure devotional service. These imperfect practitioners of bhakti-yoga are not exempt from criticism, since their fruitive activities, mental speculation and false prestige are material intrusions in the pure loving service of the Lord. A pure devotee engaged exclusively in the Lord\u2019s service should not be criticized, but a devotee whose devotional service is mixed with material qualities may be corrected so that he can rise to the platform of pure devotional service. Innocent persons should not be misled by the mixed devotional service of those not engaged exclusively in the bhakti-yoga system, but those unable to fully engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should nevertheless not give up their regular prescribed duties, declaring them to be illusion. For example, one unable to fully engage in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should not give up his family, considering it an illusion, for by doing so he will fall into illicit sex life. Material piety and analytic knowledge of the material world must therefore be cultivated until one comes to the stage of directly practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " In religious activities, ordinary dealings and personal survival one cannot avoid value judgements. Morality and religion are perennial necessities in civilized society; therefore distinctions between purity and impurity, piety and impiety, morality and immorality must somehow be ascertained. Similarly, in our ordinary, worldly activities we distinguish between palatable and tasteless food, good and bad business, high-class and low-class residences, good and bad friends, and so forth. And to insure our physical health and survival, we must constantly distinguish between what is safe and unsafe, healthy and unhealthy, profitable and unprofitable. Even a learned person must constantly distinguish between good and bad within the material world, but at the same time he must understand the transcendental position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Despite one\u2019s careful calculation of that which is materially healthy and unhealthy, the physical body will collapse and die. Despite careful scrutiny of the socially favorable and unfavorable, one\u2019s entire social milieu will vanish with the passing of time. In the same way, great religions arise and disappear in the course of history. Thus mere religiosity, social and financial expertise or physical fitness cannot award the actual perfection of life. There is a transcendental good beyond the relative good of the material world. Any sane person accepts the practical and immediate necessity of material discrimination; yet one must come ultimately to the transcendental stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, where life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in His elaborate teachings to \u015ar\u012b Uddhava, is gradually clarifying the transcendental position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness beyond the endless variety of material good and evil."

        "translation": "I have revealed this way of life for those bearing the burden of mundane religious principles.",
        "purport": " Ordinary religious principles, prescribing innumerable rules, regulations and prohibitions, are undoubtedly a great burden for those bereft of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.1.11) it is stated, bh\u016br\u012b\u1e47i bh\u016bri-karm\u0101\u1e47i \u015brotavy\u0101ni vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25: there are countless religious scriptures in the world prescribing countless religious duties. The authorized scriptures are those spoken by the Lord Himself or His representatives, as stated in this verse. In the last chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states, sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: one should give up the troublesome burden of mundane piety and directly take to the loving service of the Lord, in which everything is simplified. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.2), su-sukha\u1e41 kartum avyayam: the bhakti-yoga process, which depends completely upon the mercy of the Lord, is very joyful and easily performed. Similarly, Locana d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura sings, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, appeared five hundred years ago to distribute the sublime method of chanting the holy names of the Lord. In this way, rather than bearing the burden of artificial austerity, one can directly take to the Lord\u2019s service, cleansing one\u2019s heart and immediately experiencing transcendental bliss. Those who have taken to Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s movement follow four basic principles: no illicit sex, no eating of meat, fish or eggs, no intoxication and no gambling. They rise early in the morning, chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and spend the day happily engaged in the Lord\u2019s service. Those who follow the ritualistic karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas, however, are burdened with innumerable regulations, rituals and ceremonies, which must be personally performed by the worshipers or performed on their behalf by qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as. At any moment there is danger of discrepancy resulting in the total loss of their accumulated piety. Similarly, those on the philosophical path must painstakingly define, refine and adjust philosophical categories, a process that generally ends in confusion and hopelessness. The practitioners of mystic yoga undergo grueling penances, subjecting themselves to severe heat and cold, near starvation and so on. All such materialistic persons have personal desires to fulfill, whereas the devotees of the Lord, who desire the Lord\u2019s pleasure, simply depend upon the Lord\u2019s mercy and go back home, back to Godhead. In the previous verse the Lord mentioned that in the material world there are endless distinctions and value judgements to be made in the course of one\u2019s life. A devotee, however, sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within everything and everything within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, remaining humble, simple and blissful in the Lord\u2019s service. He does not perform elaborate religious ceremonies, nor does he become antisocial or immoral. The devotee simply chants the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and easily achieves the highest perfection of life. Ordinary persons endeavor for bodily maintenance, but a devotee is automatically maintained by the Lord\u2019s mercy. A devotee\u2019s ordinary dealings and religious activities are also all dedicated to the Personality of Godhead; thus there is nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a devotee\u2019s life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives all protection and maintenance, and the devotee gives everything to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This natural liberated situation is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is the ultimate absolute good, as explained by the Lord throughout this canto."

The concepts of good and bad depend on the choice of the Supreme Lord and not on inherent qualitative differences in material objects. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person ultimately sees all material phenomena as one. The devotee\u2019s good behavior, intelligent discrimination and artistic sense within the material world are all based on the will of God. The material elements, being emanations from the Supreme Lord, are ultimately all nondifferent. However, advocates of mundane piety fear that if the material duality of good and bad is minimized, people will become immoral or anarchistic. Certainly the impersonal and atheistic philosophy preached by modern scientists, in which material variety is reduced to mere mathematical descriptions of molecular and atomic particles, leads to immoral society. Although both material science and Vedic knowledge uncover the illusion of material variety and reveal the ultimate oneness of all material energy, only the devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are surrendered to the supreme absolute piety of God\u2019s will. Thus they always act for the benefit of all living entities, accepting material variety in the Lord\u2019s service, according to the Lord\u2019s desire. Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or God consciousness, people cannot understand the absolute position of spiritual goodness; instead they artificially try to construct a civilization based on interdependent self-interest on the material platform. Such a foolish arrangement easily collapses, as evidenced by widespread social conflict and chaos in the modern age. All members of a civilized society must accept the absolute authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then social peace and harmony will not rest on the flimsy relative platform of mundane piety and sin."

        "purport": " The words n\u0101ma-r\u016bp\u0101\u1e47i vi\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47i refer to the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, in which members of human society are designated according to four social and four occupational divisions. Those dedicated to intellectual or religious perfection are called br\u0101hma\u1e47as, those dedicated to political perfection are called k\u1e63atriyas, those dedicated to financial perfection are called vai\u015byas, and those dedicated to eating, sleeping, sex and honest work are called \u015b\u016bdras. Such propensities arise from the three modes of material nature (goodness, passion and ignorance), because the pure soul is not materially intellectual, ambitious for power, enterprising or servile. Rather, the pure soul is always absorbed in loving devotion to the Supreme Lord. If the various propensities of a conditioned soul are not engaged in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, they will certainly be misused, and thus that person will fall down from the standard of human life. The Vedic system is designed by the Lord so that conditioned souls may pursue their individual achievements and at the same time advance toward the ultimate goal of life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Just as a doctor deals with a crazy man by speaking to him sympathetically in terms of his false conception of life, one who understands the Vedic literature engages the living entities according to their illusory identification with the elements of matter. Although all material bodies are composed of the same material elements and are thus qualitatively identical, as described here by the word same\u1e63u, the Vedic social system, var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama, is created to engage all human beings in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness according to their various degrees of material identification. The absolute good is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that which approaches the Supreme Lord becomes similarly good. Because the sun is the source of heat within this world, an object that approaches the sun becomes hotter and hotter until it merges into fire. In the same manner, as we approach the transcendental nature of the Personality of Godhead, we automatically become surcharged with absolute goodness. Although this knowledge is the real basis of the Vedic literature, mundane piety is enjoined and sin is prohibited so that one can gradually come to the platform of material goodness, whereupon spiritual knowledge becomes visible."

        "purport": " The word niyam\u0101rtham (\u201cin order to restrict\u201d) is significant in this verse. A conditioned soul falsely identifies with his material senses and thus considers anything giving immediate satisfaction to the body to be good and anything inconvenient or disturbing to be bad. By higher intelligence, however, one recognizes long-term self-interest and danger. For example, medicine may be immediately bitter, but by calculating one\u2019s long-term interest one accepts the bitter medicine to cure a disease that is not immediately troublesome but ultimately fatal. Similarly, Vedic literature restricts the sinful propensities of human beings by establishing what is proper and what is improper among all the objects and activities of the material world. Because everyone must eat, the Vedas prescribe foods in the mode of goodness and not those which are sinful, such as meat, fish and eggs. Similarly, one is advised to live in a peaceful and pious community and not in association with sinful persons, nor in an unclean or turbulent environment. By designating and restricting the exploitation of the material world, Vedic knowledge gradually brings a conditioned soul to the platform of material goodness. At that stage one becomes eligible to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead and enter the transcendental stage of life. It should be remembered that such mere eligibility does not constitute actual qualification; without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness mere mundane piety can never qualify a conditioned soul to go back home, back to Godhead. Within this world we are all infected by false pride, which must be diminished through submission to the Vedic injunctions. One who is completely engaged in the loving service of the Lord need not adopt these preliminary methods, for he directly contacts the Personality of Godhead through the spontaneous process of surrender. In the previous verse the Lord explained why Vedic literatures assign different values to the bodies of different living entities, and here the Lord explains the Vedic value system in regard to the material objects that interact with these bodies."

        "purport": " The word k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-s\u0101ra refers to the spotted antelope, whose hide is used by brahmac\u0101r\u012bs while residing in the \u0101\u015brama of the spiritual master. Brahmac\u0101r\u012bs never hunt in the forest, but rather accept skins from those animals already deceased. The skin of the black or spotted antelope is also used as a garment by those receiving instruction in the execution of Vedic sacrifice. Therefore, since sacrifice cannot be properly performed in areas bereft of such creatures, these places are impure. Furthermore, although the inhabitants of a particular place may be expert in performing fruitive activities and ritualistic sacrifices, if they are inimical to the devotional service of the Lord, such a place is also polluted. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that previously the provinces of Bihar and Bengal were bereft of devotional service to the Lord and were considered impure. Then great Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas such as Jayadeva appeared in these territories, converting them into holy places. The word asauv\u012bra indicates those places without suv\u012bras, respectable saintly persons. Ordinarily, a person who obeys the state laws is considered a respectable citizen. In the same way, one who strictly obeys the law of God is considered to be a cultured or decent man, suv\u012bra. The place where such intelligent persons reside is called sauv\u012bram. K\u012bka\u1e6da refers to the modern state of Bihar, which traditionally has been known as a territory of uncivilized men. Even in such provinces, however, any place where saintly persons gather is considered to be holy. On the other hand, a province of generally respectable persons is immediately polluted by the presence of sinful men. Asa\u1e41sk\u1e5bta indicates lack of external cleanliness, as well as the absence of purificatory ceremonies for internal cleanliness. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya quotes from the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a as follows: \u201cReligious persons should reside within an eight-mile radius of rivers, oceans, mountains, hermitages, forests, spiritual cities or places where the \u015b\u0101lagr\u0101ma-\u015bil\u0101 is found. All other places should be considered k\u012bka\u1e6da, or contaminated. But if even in such contaminated places black and spotted antelopes are found, one may reside there as long as sinful persons are not also present. Even if sinful persons are present, if the civil power rests with respectable authorities, one may remain. Similarly, one may dwell wherever the Deity of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is duly installed and worshiped.\u201d The Lord here elaborates upon the theme of piety and sin, which are based on purity and impurity. Thus pure and contaminated places of residence are described here."

If one neglects the loving service of the Lord, being carried away by sense gratification, he is certainly living in most inauspicious times. Therefore that moment in which one achieves the association of the Supreme Lord or the Lord\u2019s pure devotee is the most auspicious time, whereas the moment of losing such association is most inauspicious. In other words, the perfection of life is simply K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, by which one transcends the dualities of time and space caused by the three modes of material nature."

        "purport": " Cloth is purified by application of clean water and contaminated by application of urine. The words of a saintly br\u0101hma\u1e47a are pure, but the sound vibration of a materialistic person is contaminated by lust and envy. A saintly devotee explains actual purity to others, whereas a nondevotee makes false propaganda that leads innocent people to commit polluted, sinful activities. Pure rituals are those meant for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while materialistic ceremonies are those that lead their followers into materialistic and demoniac activities. The word sa\u1e41sk\u0101re\u1e47a also indicates that the purity or impurity of a particular object is ascertained according to the regulations of ritualistic performances. For example, a flower to be offered to the Deity must be purified with water. Flowers or food cannot be offered to the Deity, however, if they have been contaminated by being smelled or tasted before the offering. The word k\u0101lena indicates that certain substances are purified by time and others contaminated by time. Rainwater, for example, is considered pure after ten days\u2019 time, and after three days in cases of emergency. On the other hand, certain foods decay in time and thus become impure. Mahatva indicates that great bodies of water do not become contaminated, and alpatay\u0101 means that a small amount of water can easily become polluted or stagnant. In the same way, a great soul is not polluted by occasional contact with materialistic persons, whereas one whose devotion to God is very small is easily carried away and put into doubt by bad association. In terms of combination with other substances, and in terms of speech, ritual, time and magnitude, the purity and impurity of all objects can be ascertained. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks that impure or decayed food is certainly forbidden for normal persons but is permissible for those who have no other means of subsistence."

        "purport": " The Lord has described the purity and impurity of different places, times and material objects. According to the laws of nature, that which is impure contaminates a particular person in accordance with that person\u2019s situation, as described here. For example, on certain occasions, such as a solar eclipse or just after childbirth, one must restrict the intake of food according to ritualistic injunctions. One who is physically weak, however, may eat without being considered impious. Ordinary persons consider the ten days following childbirth to be most auspicious, whereas one who is learned knows that this period is actually impure. Ignorance of the law does not save one from being punished, but one who consciously commits sinful activities is considered most fallen. Concerning opulence (sam\u1e5bddhi), worn-out, dirty clothing or a messy residence are considered impure for a rich man but acceptable for one who is poor. The word de\u015ba indicates that in a safe and peaceful place one is obligated to strictly perform religious rituals, whereas in a dangerous or chaotic situation one may be excused for occasional negligence of secondary principles. One who is physically healthy must offer obeisances to the Deities, attend religious functions and execute his prescribed duties, but a young child or sickly person may be excused from such activities, as indicated by the word avasth\u0101. Ultimately, as \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b states: \u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.1.11) One should accept everything which is favorable for the devotional service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and reject whatever is unfavorable. One must learn the process of serving God from the bona fide spiritual master and thus always maintain one\u2019s existence pure and free from anxiety. In general, however, when considering the relative purity and impurity of material things, all of the above-mentioned factors must be calculated."

        "purport": " The word avasth\u0101 indicates that when boys and girls are young they are kept pure by youthful innocence and that as they grow up they are kept pure through proper education and engagement. By one\u2019s individual potency one should avoid sinful activities and the association of those inclined toward sense gratification. The word karma here refers to prescribed duties, such as worshiping the spiritual master and the Deity, chanting the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra three times daily and accepting spiritual initiation. The prescribed duties of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system automatically purify one from the covering of false ego by dovetailing one\u2019s bodily designation in appropriate religious activities. There are specific duties for br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas, \u015b\u016bdras, brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, g\u1e5bhasthas, v\u0101naprasthas and sanny\u0101s\u012bs, as described previously in this canto by the Lord Himself. The most significant word here is mat-sm\u1e5bty\u0101 (\u201cby remembrance of Me\u201d). Ultimately, one cannot avoid the infection of illusion through any process except K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The three modes of nature perpetually interact, and one must sometimes fall into the mode of ignorance and sometimes rise to the mode of goodness, uselessly rotating within the kingdom of illusion. But by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, remembrance of the Personality of Godhead, one can actually uproot one\u2019s tendency to act against the will of the Absolute Truth. Then one becomes freed from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 and goes back home, back to Godhead. As stated in the Garu\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cWhether one is pure or contaminated, and regardless of one\u2019s external situation, simply by remembering the lotus-eyed Personality of Godhead one can internally and externally cleanse one\u2019s existence.\u201d Lord Caitanya recommended that we constantly remember the Supreme Lord by chanting His holy names, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. This sublime process is essential for every human actually desirous of purifying his existence."

        "purport": " The Lord clearly explains here that material piety and sin are always relative considerations. For example, if a neighbor\u2019s house is on fire and one chops a hole in the roof so that the trapped family may escape, one is considered to be a pious hero because of the dangerous condition. In normal conditions, however, if one chops a hole in his neighbor\u2019s roof or breaks the neighbor\u2019s windows, he is considered a criminal. Similarly, one who abandons one\u2019s wife and children is certainly irresponsible and thoughtless. If one takes sanny\u0101sa, however, and remains fixed on a higher spiritual platform, he is considered to be a most saintly person. Piety and sin therefore depend upon particular circumstances and are at times difficult to distinguish. According to \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, persons above the age of fourteen are considered capable of distinguishing between good and bad and are thus responsible for their pious and sinful activities. Animals, on the other hand, being merged in ignorance, cannot be blamed for their offenses or praised for their so-called good qualities, which all arise ultimately from ignorance. Human beings who act like animals, with the idea that one should not feel any guilt but should do whatever one likes, will certainly take birth as animals absorbed in ignorance. And there are other foolish people who, observing the relativity of material piety and sin, conclude that there is no absolute good. It should be understood, however, that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is absolutely good because it involves complete obedience to the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose goodness is eternal and absolute. Those who are inclined to study material piety and sin ultimately experience frustration due to the relativity and variability of the subject matter. One should therefore come to the transcendental platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is valid and perfect in all circumstances."

Piety and sin on the material level are thus relative considerations. Any member of society, however, who receives d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101, initiation into the chanting of the Lord\u2019s holy names, must strictly obey the four regulative principles: no eating of meat, fish or eggs, no illicit sex, no intoxication and no gambling.

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly explains in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that prescribed duties performed as an offering to the Lord award liberation from material bondage.

Although the Vedic literature sometimes sanctions sense gratification, the ultimate purpose of the Vedas is renunciation, since Vedic culture cannot possibly recommend anything that disturbs human life. A lusty person is easily angered and becomes inimical to anyone frustrating his lusty desires. Since his sex desire can never be satisfied, a lusty person ultimately becomes frustrated with his own sex partner, and thus a \u201clove-hate\u201d relationship develops. A lusty person considers himself to be the enjoyer of God\u2019s creation and is therefore full of pride and false prestige. The lusty, proud person will not be attracted to the process of humble submission at the lotus feet of the bona fide spiritual master. Attraction to illicit sex is thus the direct enemy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which depends upon humble submission to the representative of the Supreme Lord. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that desire for illicit sex is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world. Because modern society sanctions unrestricted mixing of men and women, its citizens cannot possibly achieve peace; rather, the regulation of conflict becomes the basis of social survival. This is the symptom of an ignorant society falsely accepting the material body as the highest good, as described here by the words vi\u1e63aye\u1e63u gu\u1e47\u0101dhy\u0101s\u0101t.

Since every living entity is part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, anyone who falsely identifies with the external body is actually unconscious of his real position. Thus it is stated, \u015b\u016bny\u0101ya kalpate: pursuing that which has no factual existence, he is devoid of any tangible progress or benefit in life. One whose consciousness is absorbed in the nonexistent becomes himself practically nonexistent. In this way, the eternal living entities become fallen, lost in the ocean of material existence, and it is only by the special mercy of the pure devotees of the Lord that they can be rescued. The Lord\u2019s devotees therefore instruct the fallen people to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare.

The Lord here explains that the fruitive rewards offered in religious scriptures are merely inducements, like candy that is used to induce a child to take medicine. It is actually the medicine that is beneficial, and not the candy. Similarly, in fruitive sacrifices it is the worship of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u that is beneficial, not the fruitive reward itself. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, those professing fruitive rewards to be the ultimate goal of religious scripture are certainly less intelligent fools inimical to the purpose of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord desires that all conditioned souls be purified and come back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. One who opposes the Lord\u2019s purpose in the name of religiosity is certainly bewildered about the purpose of life."

In order to bring such foolish persons under the canopy of Vedic injunctions, the Vedas promise innumerable material rewards, even promotion to heavenly planets, to those who faithfully execute the Vedic injunctions. As explained by the Lord, such rewards are like the candy offered to a child, who then faithfully takes his medicine. Material enjoyment is certainly the cause of suffering, since all enjoyable objects are subject to destruction along with the so-called enjoyer. Material life is simply painful and full of anxiety, frustration and lamentation. We become agitated by seeing a so-called enjoyable object, such as the naked body of a woman, a beautiful residence, a sumptuous tray of food or the expansion of our own prestige, but actually such imagined happiness is simply the intense expectation of a satisfaction that never comes. One remains perpetually frustrated in material existence, and the more one tries to enjoy, the more one\u2019s frustration increases. Therefore, the Vedic knowledge, which aims at ultimate peace and happiness on the spiritual platform, cannot possibly authorize the materialistic way of life. Material rewards are employed by the Vedas merely as inducements for the conditioned soul to take the medicine, submission to the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, through various types of sacrifice. Those who are veda-v\u0101da-rata claim that religious scriptures are meant to facilitate sense gratification in the ignorance of conditioned life. The true goal of religion, however, is spiritual liberation, in which material sense gratification ceases to exist. The darkness of bodily attachment cannot exist in the effulgent light of spiritual knowledge. In the ocean of spiritual bliss, the anxiety-ridden apparent pleasure of this world vanishes completely. The true meaning of veda, or perfect knowledge, is to surrender to the Supreme Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge as the Lord\u2019s faithful servant."

In the same way, the flowery statements of the Vedas describing heavenly enjoyment do not award the real fruit of Vedic knowledge but merely supply decorative blossoms of sense gratification.

Such unfortunate persons mistake the flowery statements of the Vedas to be the highest perfection of life. The word agni-mugdh\u0101\u1e25, \u201cbewildered by fire,\u201d indicates that such persons consider Vedic fire sacrifices awarding material benefit to be the highest religious truth, and thus they merge into ignorance. Fire produces smoke, which obscures one\u2019s vision. Similarly, the path of fruitive fire sacrifices is cloudy and obscure, without clear understanding of the spirit soul. The Lord here clearly states that fruitive religionists cannot understand their actual spiritual identity, nor do they realize the genuine shelter of the spirit soul in the kingdom of God. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: all Vedic knowledge is actually meant to lead one to pure love of Godhead. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is certainly the Absolute Truth, and to love Him is the ultimate purpose of our existence. The Vedic knowledge patiently tries to bring the conditioned soul to this perfection of pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Such passion for violence, however, is never encouraged within the process of Vedic sacrifice.",
        "purport": " The Vedic scriptures sanction occasional animal sacrifice to satisfy cruel, low-class men who cannot live without the taste of flesh and blood. Such concessions, however, are restricted by rigorous obligatory rituals and are meant to gradually discourage animal killing, just as the exorbitant cost of a liquor license restricts the number of retail outlets selling alcoholic beverages. But unscrupulous persons misconstrue such restrictive sanctions and declare that Vedic sacrifice is meant for killing animals in order to enjoy sense gratification. Being materialistic, they desire to attain the planets of the forefathers or demigods and thus worship such beings. Sometimes materialistic persons are attracted to the subtle lifestyle of ghosts and worship ghostly creatures. These methods constitute gross ignorance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the actual enjoyer of all sacrifice and austerity. The demons perform Vedic sacrifice but are inimical to Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, for they consider the demigods, the forefathers or Lord \u015aiva to be equal to God. Although understanding the authority of Vedic rituals, they do not accept the ultimate Vedic conclusion and therefore never surrender to God. Thus false religious principles flourish in the demoniac societies of the animal killers. Although in countries like America people outwardly profess to be followers of God alone, actual worship and glorification is offered to innumerable popular heroes such as entertainers, politicians, athletes and other equally insignificant persons. Animal killers, being grossly materialistic, are inevitably attracted to the extraordinary features of material illusion; they cannot understand the real platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or spiritual life."

Ignorant persons possessing a tendency toward goodness may go to hell but are also allowed a little heavenly pleasure. Thus it can be seen that a man suffering in miserable financial or political conditions sometimes enjoys the company of a beautiful wife, though his general condition is hellish. Those in ignorance mixed slightly with passion simply go to hell, and those purely in the mode of ignorance glide down to the darkest region of hell. Those devoid of devotion to the Supreme Lord are in ignorance in these three categories. Sometimes persons situated in the mode of goodness accept the supremacy of the Supreme Lord but are more attracted to the demigods, believing that through Vedic rituals they can achieve the same standard of living as the demigods. This proud tendency is certainly an obstacle in the loving service of the Supreme Lord and ultimately causes falldown."

        "purport": " In the previous verses Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly refuted the concept that Vedic knowledge is meant for material enjoyment, and here the Lord summarizes the actual purpose of Vedic literature: self-realization. Although the conditioned souls are struggling in the network of material energy, their actual existence is transcendental freedom in the kingdom of God. The Vedas gradually lift the conditioned soul out of the darkness of illusion and establish him in the eternal loving service of the Lord. As stated in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (4.4.22), an\u0101v\u1e5btti\u1e25 \u015babd\u0101t: \u201cOne who properly hears Vedic knowledge does not have to return to the cycle of birth and death.\u201d One may ask why the Lord Himself as well as the Lord\u2019s representatives, the Vedic seers and mantras, speak in esoteric or indirect terms. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sarvasya: the Supreme Lord does not allow Himself to be taken cheaply, and thus He is not manifest to superficial or inimical people. Those who are polluted by the material atmosphere are induced to purify themselves through Vedic rituals that offer fruitive results, just as a child is induced to take medicine by the offer of a candy reward. Because of the confidential nature of Vedic exposition, less intelligent persons cannot appreciate the ultimate transcendental purpose of the Vedas, and consequently they fall down to the platform of sense gratification. The term brahm\u0101tma (\u201cspirit soul\u201d) ultimately indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that knowledge of Him is r\u0101ja-guhyam, the most confidential of all secrets. One who depends upon material sense perception remains in gross ignorance of the Absolute Truth. One who depends upon mental and intellectual speculation may get a clue that the eternal soul and Supersoul are both within the material body. But one who depends upon the Lord Himself, faithfully hearing the Lord\u2019s own message in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, perfectly understands the entire situation and goes back home, back to Godhead, having fulfilled the true purpose of Vedic knowledge."

        "purport": " According to Vedic knowledge, the Vedic sound is divided into four phases, which can be understood only by the most intelligent br\u0101hma\u1e47as. This is because three of the divisions are internally situated within the living entity and only the fourth division is externally manifested, as speech. Even this fourth phase of Vedic sound, called vaikhar\u012b, is very difficult to understand for ordinary human beings. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains these divisions as follows. The pr\u0101\u1e47a phase of Vedic sound, known as par\u0101, is situated in the \u0101dh\u0101ra-cakra; the mental phase, known as pa\u015byant\u012b, is situated in the area of the navel, on the ma\u1e47ip\u016braka-cakra; the intellectual phase, known as madhyam\u0101, is situated in the heart area, in the an\u0101hata-cakra. Finally, the manifest sensory phase of Vedic sound is called vaikhar\u012b. Such Vedic sound is ananta-p\u0101ra because it comprehends all vital energies within the universe and beyond and is thus undivided by time or space. Actually, Vedic sound vibration is so subtle, unfathomable and deep that only the Lord Himself and His empowered followers such as Vy\u0101sa and N\u0101rada can understand its actual form and meaning. Ordinary human beings cannot comprehend all of the intricacies and subtleties of Vedic sound, but if one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one can immediately understand the conclusion of all Vedic knowledge, namely Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, the original source of Vedic knowledge. Foolish persons devote their vital air, senses and mind to sense gratification and thus do not understand the transcendental value of the holy name of God. Ultimately, the essence of all Vedic sound is the holy name of the Supreme Lord, which is not different from the Lord Himself. Since the Lord is unlimited, His holy name is equally unlimited. No one can understand the transcendental glories of the Lord without the Lord\u2019s direct mercy. By offenselessly chanting the holy names Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, one can enter into the transcendental mysteries of Vedic sound. Otherwise the knowledge of the Vedas will remain durvig\u0101hyam, or impossible to penetrate."

        "translation": "Just as a spider brings forth from its heart its web and emits it through its mouth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests Himself as the reverberating primeval vital air, comprising all sacred Vedic meters and full of transcendental pleasure. Thus the Lord, from the ethereal sky of His heart, creates the great and limitless Vedic sound by the agency of His mind, which conceives of variegated sounds such as the spar\u015bas. The Vedic sound branches out in thousands of directions, adorned with the different letters expanded from the syllable om: the consonants, vowels, sibilants and semivowels. The Veda is then elaborated by many verbal varieties, expressed in different meters, each having four more syllables than the previous one. Ultimately the Lord again withdraws His manifestation of Vedic sound within Himself.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has given an elaborate technical explanation of these three verses, the understanding of which requires extensive linguistic knowledge of the Sanskrit language. The essential point is that transcendental knowledge is expressed through Vedic sound vibration, which is itself a manifestation of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. Vedic sound emanates from the Supreme Lord and is vibrated to glorify and understand Him. The conclusion of all Vedic sound vibration is found in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, wherein the Lord states, vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: all Vedic knowledge is simply meant to teach us to know and love God. One who always thinks of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who becomes the Lord\u2019s devotee and who bows down to and worships the Lord with faith and devotion, chanting His holy name, has certainly achieved a perfect understanding of all that is indicated by the word veda (\u201cknowledge\u201d)."

The transcendental sound vibration thus establishes Me as the essential meaning of all Vedic knowledge. The Vedas, elaborately analyzing all material duality as nothing but My illusory potency, ultimately completely negate this duality and achieve their own satisfaction.",
        "purport": " The Lord declared in the previous verse that He alone knows the ultimate purpose of the Vedas, and now the Lord reveals that He alone is the ultimate basis and purpose of all Vedic knowledge. The karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas prescribes ritualistic sacrifices for promotion to heaven. Such sacrifices are the Lord Himself. Similarly, the up\u0101san\u0101-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas designates different demigods as objects of ritualistic worship, and these deities are not different from the Lord Himself, being expansions of the Lord\u2019s body. In the j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas different philosophical methods of analysis are presented and refuted. Such knowledge, which analyzes the potency of the Supreme Lord, is not different from Him. Ultimately Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everything, because everything is part and parcel of the Lord\u2019s multipotencies. Although Vedic literature entices those absorbed in material duality to begin the Vedic way of life by offering them materially desirable rewards, the Vedas eventually refute all material duality by bringing one to the stage of God consciousness, wherein there is nothing different from the Supreme Lord. Within the Vedic literature there are various injunctions stating that at a particular stage of life one should give up fruitive rituals and take to the path of knowledge. Similarly, other injunctions declare that a self-realized soul should give up the path of speculative knowledge and take directly to the shelter of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. But nowhere is there an injunction recommending that one give up the loving service of the Lord, because that is the eternal constitutional position of every living entity. Different philosophical theses are presented and rejected in the Vedas, since one who is progressing must give up each previous stage in the advancement of knowledge. For example, one who is addicted to sex enjoyment is taught to accept religious marriage and enjoy sex pleasure with his wife. Such ritualistic knowledge is to be given up when one attains the stage of detachment, whereupon one is recommended to take the renounced order of life. In that stage of life one is forbidden to see or speak with women. When, however, one reaches the perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, wherein the Lord is manifest everywhere, one may engage all living entities, including women, in the loving service of the Lord without danger of spiritual falldown. Thus different injunctions based on progressive stages of spiritual vision are presented and refuted in Vedic literature. Since all such injunctions and processes are ultimately meant for the achievement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the loving service of the Lord, they are not different from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. The conditioned soul, therefore, should not prematurely stop his progressive march back home, back to Godhead, by foolishly mistaking an intermediate or preliminary stage of advancement as the actual goal of life. One must understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the source, maintenance and resting place of everything, and that every living entity is the Lord\u2019s eternal servant. In this way one should continue on the Vedic path all the way back home, back to Godhead, for eternal life of bliss and knowledge."
