N\u0101rada Muni cites a conversation between King Nimi and the J\u0101yanteyas. According to J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the word abh\u012bk\u1e63\u1e47am indicates that although N\u0101rada Muni was frequently sent by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here and there for various pastimes, such as inquiring about the affairs of the world, N\u0101rada continuously returned to reside in Dv\u0101rak\u0101.

The conditioned souls are struggling within the kingdom of m\u0101y\u0101 against the cruel laws of material nature, such as birth, death, old age and disease, but if such conditioned souls have the good fortune to enter the city of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whether Dv\u0101rak\u0101, Mathur\u0101 or V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and live there under the direct protection of the omnipotent arms of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they will experience the unlimited transcendental bliss of real life, which is eternal and which is meant to be lived in the personal company of God."

        "translation": "My dear King, in the material world the conditioned souls are confronted by death at every step of life. Therefore, who among the conditioned souls would not render service to the lotus feet of Lord Mukunda, who is worshipable even for the greatest of liberated souls?",
        "purport": " The word indriyav\u0101n is significant in this verse. Indriyav\u0101n means \u201cpossessing senses.\u201d Although we are conditioned within the material world, by the mercy of the Supreme Lord we are awarded a human body, which possesses distinct senses, such as the eyes, ears, tongue, nose and skin. Generally the conditioned souls use these senses in a false attempt to exploit the material nature for sense gratification. But our material senses and their objects are temporary, and it is not possible to become peaceful or happy in the attempt to gratify our temporary senses with the temporary sense objects offered by m\u0101y\u0101, the illusory energy of the Lord. In fact, our strenuous endeavor to satisfy the material senses inevitably brings exactly the opposite result, namely material suffering. A man is attracted to a woman. Being sexually aroused he marries her, and soon there is a family that requires ever-increasing support. In this way his innocent and simple life is ended, and he spends the major portion of his life working hard like an ass to support the demands of his family. In the Third Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Lord Kapila describes very clearly that in spite of the exhausting work a man performs throughout his life, his family is ultimately dissatisfied, and when the exhausted father reaches old age, the irritated family members look upon him just as farmers look upon an old and useless ox. Sometimes the sons dream of receiving their father\u2019s money as an inheritance and secretly wish for him to die. Nowadays people strongly resent the trouble of caring for elderly parents and therefore send them to an institution, where they die lonely and neglected after a life of hard work for their so-called loved ones. One doctor in England is seriously proposing euthanasia for elderly persons who are no longer productive. Nowadays some people, desiring material sense gratification but hoping to avoid the inconvenience of family life, try to enjoy \u201cfree\u201d sexual relations with women, without the trouble of marriage. Through birth control and abortion they eliminate the disturbance of caring for children. In this way they hope to enjoy material sense gratification without any material impediment. By the laws of nature, however, such persons become bound in a network of sinful reactions by avoiding their real duty to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by thoughtlessly causing violence and suffering to others for increasing their own sense gratification. Caught in a network of impious activities, they drift further and further away from their original pure consciousness and gradually lose all power to understand the laws of nature. Therefore it is stated here, sarvato-m\u1e5btyu\u1e25. M\u1e5btyu means \u201cdeath.\u201d Death suddenly appears, startling such confident sense gratifiers, and destroys their entire program of so-called material happiness. Often such persons are afflicted with ghastly diseases and undergo inconceivable suffering, which ends in death. If a sincere well-wisher points these facts out to them, trying to inform them of the reality, they become angry and accuse him of being a pessimist or a religious fanatic. In this way they blindly ignore the laws of nature until these laws inevitably smash them down and drag them out of their fool\u2019s paradise. Because of an excessive accumulation of sinful results, they are forced into situations of great distress by the laws of karma. Sinking down into the lower species of life, they lose all awareness of that which lies beyond their gross material senses. Sometimes a living being is able to understand the miserable result of materialistic sense gratification. Being frustrated by the pain and suffering of materialistic life and being ignorant of any superior life, he adopts a neo-Buddhist philosophy and seeks shelter in so-called nothingness. But there is no actual void within the kingdom of God. The desire to merge into nothingness is a reaction against material pain; it is not a tangible concept of the Supreme. For example, if I feel unbearable pain in my leg and the pain cannot be cured, I may finally agree to have my leg amputated. But it is far better to remove the pain and keep my leg. Similarly, because of false ego we think, \u201cI am everything. I am the most important person. No one is as intelligent as me.\u201d Thinking in this way, we suffer constantly and experience intense anxiety. But as soon as we purify the ego by admitting that we are insignificant eternal servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, our ego will give us great pleasure. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord of the blissfully variegated spiritual sky, called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, is always absorbed in transcendental enjoyment. In fact, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the reservoir of all pleasure. People absorbed in materialistic enjoyment are bound by the laws of omnipresent death, but if we endeavor instead to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we can immediately be connected to His hl\u0101din\u012b \u015bakti, or blissful potency. If we serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a under the guidance of His authorized representative, the spiritual master, we can immediately get relief from material distress. Then we shall not yearn after nothing, but instead we shall be able to relish unlimited spiritual bliss in the service of the Supreme Lord. Sarvato-m\u1e5btyu\u1e25 also indicates that birth and death occur on every planet in the universe. Therefore our so-called space travel and cosmic consciousness are useless, since there is no eternal life anywhere within the material cosmos. In conclusion, to understand the futility of engaging in the service of anything other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and to engage instead in serving that which is eternal and full of bliss is the highest possible development of intelligence. Although our present intelligence is narrow, being conditioned by the laws of nature, we can create unlimited good fortune for ourselves by taking shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, learning to discriminate between that which is temporary and useless and that which is eternal and real."

        "purport": " Vasudeva herein describes the glories of N\u0101rada Muni. The words k\u1e5bpa\u1e47\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 yath\u0101 pitror uttama-\u015bloka-vartman\u0101m are significant. K\u1e5bpa\u1e47\u0101n\u0101m refers to the most wretched persons, whereas uttama-\u015bloka-vartman\u0101m refers to the most fortunate, those who are advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has stated, tath\u0101 bhagavad-r\u016bpasya bhavato y\u0101tr\u0101 sarva-dehin\u0101\u1e41 svastaya iti. The word bhagavad-r\u016bpasya indicates that N\u0101rada Muni is an expansion of the Supreme Lord and that his activities therefore bring immense benefit for all living beings. In the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, N\u0101rada Muni is described as a manifestation of the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There it is stated that N\u0101rada is especially empowered to give instructions in the art of devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. N\u0101rada is especially able to advise the conditioned souls as to how they can dovetail their present activities with the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without unnecessarily disrupting their present life. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b has defined the word k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a by quoting from the B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (3.8.10). Etad ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 g\u0101rgi aviditv\u0101sm\u0101l lok\u0101t praiti sa k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a\u1e25: \u201cO daughter of Garg\u0101c\u0101rya, he who leaves this world without learning about the infallible Supreme is a k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a, or miser.\u201d In other words, we are awarded the human form of life so that we may understand our eternal, blissful relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As indicated in verse 2 of this chapter by the word indriyav\u0101n, the human body is specifically awarded so that we may serve the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This human form of body is the greatest fortune because the highly evolved intelligence of human life enables us to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Absolute Truth. If we are unable to understand our eternal relationship with God, we shall derive no permanent benefit whatsoever in this present life, nor can we ultimately benefit others. One who receives a great treasure but can neither use it himself nor dedicate it to the happiness of others is called a miser. Therefore, a person who leaves this world without having understood his actual position as servant of God is called a k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a, or miser. This verse states that N\u0101rada Muni is so empowered in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that he can lift even miserly rascals out of their illusion, just as a kind father goes to his child and wakes him from a distressing nightmare. Our present materialistic life is just like a troublesome dream, from which great souls such as N\u0101rada can wake us. N\u0101rada Muni is so powerful that even those already advanced in devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can greatly enhance their spiritual position by hearing his instructions, as they will be given here in the Eleventh Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Therefore \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada is the guru and father of all living beings, who are originally devotees of the Lord but who are now artificially attempting to enjoy the material world in the material bodies of human beings, animals, and so on."

        "purport": " This verse clearly states that the pure devotees of the Lord such as N\u0101rada Muni are saintly persons, to be considered superior even to the demigods, the living beings empowered by the Supreme Lord to administer the entire universe. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.12) it is stated: \u201cThe demigods in charge of the various necessities of life, being satisfied by the performance of yaj\u00f1a [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But one who enjoys these gifts without offering them in return to the demigods is certainly a thief.\u201d In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has made the following comment regarding the demigods: \u201cThe demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs. The supply of air, light, water and other blessings for maintaining the body and the soul of all living entities are entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable assistants in the different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their pleasure and displeasure depend on the performance of yaj\u00f1as by the human being.\u201d In other words, by the Lord\u2019s arrangement, material prosperity depends upon the satisfaction of the demigods. If the demigods are dissatisfied due to nonperformance or improper performance of sacrifice, they are empowered to impose various types of suffering upon human beings. Usually this suffering takes the form of either excessive or insufficient supply of material necessities. For example, sunshine is necessary for life, but if there is excessive heat or insufficient heat from the sun, we suffer. Excessive or insufficient rain is also a cause of suffering. Thus the demigods bestow either happiness or suffering upon human beings, in accordance with the performance of sacrifice. As stated here, however, great saintly persons such as N\u0101rada Muni are always merciful to all living beings. \u201cThe symptoms of a s\u0101dhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities, he has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.25.21) \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da, in his commentary on this verse, has portrayed the s\u0101dhu as follows: \u201cA s\u0101dhu as described above is a devotee of the Lord. His concern, therefore, is to enlighten people in devotional service to the Lord. That is his mercy. He knows that without devotional service to the Lord, human life is spoiled. A devotee travels all over the country door to door preaching, \u2018Be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Be a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Don\u2019t spoil your life in simply fulfilling your animal propensities. Human life is meant for self-realization, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u2019 These are the preachings of a s\u0101dhu. He is not satisfied with his own liberation. He always thinks about others. He is the most compassionate personality toward all the fallen souls. One of his qualifications, therefore, is k\u0101ru\u1e47ika, great mercy to the fallen souls. While engaged in preaching work he has to meet with so many opposing elements, and therefore the s\u0101dhu, or devotee of the Lord, has to be very tolerant. Someone may ill-treat him, because the conditioned souls are not prepared to receive the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. They do not like it; that is their disease. The s\u0101dhu has the thankless task of impressing upon them the importance of devotional service. Sometimes devotees are personally attacked with violence. Lord Jesus Christ was crucified. Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura was caned in twenty-two marketplaces, and Lord Caitanya\u2019s principal assistant, Nity\u0101nanda, was violently attacked by Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i. But still they were tolerant because their mission was to deliver the fallen souls. One of the qualifications of a s\u0101dhu is that he is very tolerant and is merciful to all fallen souls. He is merciful because he is a well-wisher of all living entities. He is not only a well-wisher of human society, but a well-wisher of animal society as well. It is said here, sarva-dehin\u0101m, which indicates all living entities who have accepted material bodies. Not only does a human being have a material body, but other living entities, such as cats and dogs, also have material bodies. The devotee of the Lord is merciful to everyone \u2014 the cats, dogs, trees, etc. He treats all living entities in such a way that they can ultimately get salvation from this material entanglement. \u015aiv\u0101nanda Sena, one of the disciples of Lord Caitanya, gave liberation to a dog by treating the dog transcendentally. There are many instances where a dog got salvation by association with a s\u0101dhu, because a s\u0101dhu engages in the highest philanthropic activities for the benediction of all living entities. Although the s\u0101dhu is not inimical toward anyone, the world is so ungrateful that even a s\u0101dhu has many enemies. \u201cWhat is the difference between an enemy and a friend? It is a difference in behavior. A s\u0101dhu behaves with all conditioned souls for their ultimate relief from material entanglement. Therefore, no one can be more friendly than the s\u0101dhu in relieving a conditioned soul. A s\u0101dhu is calm, and he quietly and peacefully follows the principles of scripture and at the same time is a devotee of the Lord. One who actually follows the principles of scripture must be a devotee of God because all the \u015b\u0101stras instruct us to obey the orders of the Personality of Godhead. S\u0101dhu, therefore, means a follower of the scriptural injunctions and a devotee of the Lord. All these characteristics are prominent in a devotee. A devotee develops all the good qualities of the demigods, whereas a nondevotee, even though academically qualified, has no actual good qualifications or good characteristics according to the standards of transcendental realization.\u201d Vasudeva, therefore, has used the word s\u0101dhu to describe N\u0101rada Muni, indicating that the position of the devotee of the Lord is superior even to that of the demigods."

        "translation": "Those who worship the demigods receive reciprocation from the demigods in a way just corresponding to the offering. The demigods are attendants of karma, like a person\u2019s shadow, but s\u0101dhus are actually merciful to the fallen.",
        "purport": " The words ch\u0101yeva karma-saciv\u0101\u1e25 are significant here. Ch\u0101y\u0101 means \u201cshadow.\u201d The shadow of the body precisely follows the movements of the body. The shadow has no power to move in a way different from the movement of the body. Similarly, as stated here, bhajanti ye yath\u0101 dev\u0101n dev\u0101 api tathaiva t\u0101n: the results the demigods award to living beings correspond exactly to the living beings\u2019 actions. The demigods are empowered by the Lord to follow precisely the particular karma of a living entity in awarding him happiness and distress. Just as a shadow cannot move independently, the demigods cannot punish or reward a living being independently. Although the demigods are millions of times more powerful than the human beings on earth, they are ultimately tiny servants of God whom the Lord allows to play as the controllers of the universe. In the Fourth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, an empowered incarnation of the Lord, states that even the demigods are subject to punishment by the Lord if they deviate from His laws. On the other hand, devotees of the Lord such as N\u0101rada Muni, by their potent preaching, can interfere in the karma of a living being by persuading him to give up his fruitive activity and mental speculation and surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In material existence, one works hard under the bondage of ignorance. But if one becomes enlightened by association with a pure devotee of the Lord, one can understand one\u2019s actual position as an eternal servant of God. By rendering such service, one dissolves his attachment to the material world and the reactions of his previous activities, and as a surrendered soul he is endowed with unlimited spiritual freedom in the service of the Lord. In this regard, the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.54) states: \u201cI adore the primeval Lord, Govinda, who burns to the root all the fruitive activities of those imbued with devotion. For those who walk the path of work \u2014 no less for Indra, king of the demigods, than for the tiny insect indragopa \u2014 He impartially ordains the due enjoyments of the fruits of activities in accordance with the chain of works previously performed.\u201d Even the demigods are bound to the laws of karma, whereas a pure devotee of the Lord, having completely given up the desire for material enjoyment, successfully burns to ashes all traces of karma. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has commented that unless one is engaged as a surrendered soul in the devotional service of the Lord, he cannot actually be considered ni\u1e63k\u0101ma, or free from all personal desire. Sometimes a materialistic person will engage in charity or altruistic activities and in this way consider himself a selfless worker. Similarly, those who engage in mental speculation with the ultimate goal of merging into the impersonal Brahman aspect of the Lord also advertise themselves as being selfless or desireless. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b, however, such karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, while busy in their so-called \u201cselflessness,\u201d are in fact servants of lusty desires. In other words, they have not perfectly understood their position as eternal servants of God. The altruistic karm\u012b falsely considers himself the best friend of humanity, although he is unable to give actual benefit to others because he is ignorant of the eternal life of bliss and knowledge beyond the temporary hallucination of material existence. Similarly, although the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b proudly declares himself God and invites others to become God also, he neglects to explain how the so-called gods have come to be bound by the laws of material nature. Actually, the attempt to become God is based not on love of God but on the desire to take the same status as God. In other words, the desire to be equal in all respects to the Supreme is simply another materialistic desire. Therefore the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, because of their dissatisfaction in artificially trying to fulfill their own desires, can show no actual mercy to the fallen souls. In this regard, \u015ar\u012b Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted the Udd\u0101ma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u201c\u1e5a\u1e63is want happiness for all beings and are almost always incapable of tolerating the unhappiness of men. Nevertheless, the demigods are superior because they are very dear to Lord Hari.\u201d But although \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has placed the demigods in a higher position than the merciful \u1e5b\u1e63is, \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated, s\u0101dhavas tu na karm\u0101nugat\u0101\u1e25: the s\u0101dhus are actually better than the demigods because the s\u0101dhus are merciful regardless of the pious or impious acts of the conditioned souls. This apparent disagreement between Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya and J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b is resolved by Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, who points out that in the statement by \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, the word \u1e5b\u1e63i, or \u201csage,\u201d indicates the so-called s\u0101dhus or saintly persons among the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs. Ordinary fruitive workers and speculative philosophers certainly consider themselves to be at the summit of pious morality and altruism. However, since they are ignorant of the supreme position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they cannot be considered equal to the demigods, who are all devotees of the Lord and aware that all living beings are eternal servants of the Lord. Even such demigods, however, cannot be compared to the pure devotees such as N\u0101rada. Such pure devotees are empowered to award the highest perfection of life to both pious and impious living beings, who have only to follow the orders of such pure devotees."

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, N\u0101rada Muni might have been reluctant to instruct Vasudeva because of natural respect for Vasudeva\u2019s exalted position as the father of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. N\u0101rada might have thought that since Vasudeva was already perfect in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness there was no need to instruct him in the process of devotional service. Therefore, anticipating N\u0101rada\u2019s possible reluctance, Vasudeva specifically requested N\u0101rada to preach to him about devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the symptom of a pure devotee. A pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never considers himself exalted. To the contrary, he meekly feels that his devotional service is most imperfect but that somehow or other Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, out of His causeless mercy, is accepting such imperfect service. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has stated in this regard: \u201cOne can chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, feeling himself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respect to others.\u201d (\u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka 3) The conditioned souls in this material world become falsely proud of their so-called family lineage. This pride is false because one who has taken birth in the material world is in a fallen situation, even in the best of cases. Vasudeva, however, was certainly not fallen, since he had taken birth in the family of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Since he was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s father, his position was most exalted, yet because he was a pure devotee he did not become proud of his special relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Instead, considering himself deficient in spiritual understanding, he took advantage of the appearance of N\u0101rada Muni, a great preacher of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, by immediately inquiring from him about devotional service. This incomparable humility of a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is far superior to the false humility of the impersonalist, who actually maintains a desire to be equal to God though adopting the external behavior of a meek and saintly person. Bhayam, or fear, is caused by seeing something other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25). Everything is actually an emanation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25) and as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25, v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti, etc.). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the well-wishing friend of every living entity (suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m). If a living being gives up his misguided attempt to defy the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to the Lord, certainly he becomes confident in his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A surrendered soul can actually experience that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is his well-wishing friend, and since that friend is the supreme absolute controller of all existence, there is certainly no cause for fear. The son of a rich man certainly feels confident while touring the estate of his father. Similarly, an empowered representative of the government feels confident in the discharge of his duty. In the same way, a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, acting as a representative of the Supreme Lord, feels confident because he can understand at every moment that the entire material and spiritual creation is strictly under the control of his benevolent master. The nondevotee, however, denies the supreme position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and therefore imagines that something is different from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. For example, if a servant of the government thinks that there is some dangerous obstacle that cannot be controlled by the government\u2019s power, he becomes fearful. If a child feels that there is some power that cannot be subdued by his father, then he becomes fearful. Similarly, because we artificially think that there is something within existence that is not under the strict control of the benevolent Lord, we become fearful. Such a concept of a second thing (something other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) is called dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015ba, and it immediately creates a foreign atmosphere of bhayam, or fear. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called abhaya\u1e45kara, which means that He destroys all fear in the heart of His devotee. Sometimes so-called scholars, distraught after many years of impersonal speculation and enjoyment of materialistic life, become fearful and anxious. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b compares such disturbed philosophers to the bound vulture in the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad. Desiring liberation from fear, such speculators unfortunately concoct an imaginary liberation (vimukta-m\u0101nina\u1e25) and try to take shelter of impersonal spiritual existence or voidness. But the Bh\u0101gavatam (10.2.32) states, \u0101ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25/ patanty adho\u00a0\u2019n\u0101d\u1e5bta-yu\u1e63mad-a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25: because such speculators have not rectified their original mistake of rejecting their eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fall from their concocted liberation and thus remain in a fearful condition. Vasudeva, however, is openly eager to hear more and more about devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore he states, y\u0101n \u015brutv\u0101 \u015braddhay\u0101 martyo mucyate sarvato bhay\u0101t: simply by hearing about pure devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, a conditioned soul can easily free himself from all types of fear, and this transcendental freedom is certainly eternal."

        "translation": "In a previous birth on this earth, I worshiped the Supreme Lord, Ananta, who alone can award liberation, but because I desired to have a child, I did not worship Him for liberation. Thus I was bewildered by the Lord\u2019s illusory energy.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b the word kila (meaning \u201cindeed, it is true,\u201d \u201cit is said\u201d or \u201cas is well known\u201d) indicates that Vasudeva was remembering the words the Lord had spoken to him when the Lord had appeared as four-armed Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in the prison of Ka\u1e41sa. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b states that from the anxiety of Vasudeva, which is expressed in this verse by the words ap\u016bjaya\u1e41 na mok\u1e63\u0101ya mohito deva-m\u0101yay\u0101, it is to be discerned that Vasudeva had heard of the curse of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as at Pi\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101raka against the Yadu dynasty and that he could understand from this curse that the Lord\u2019s disappearance from the earth was imminent. Vasudeva understood that the Lord\u2019s manifest pastimes within this universe were coming to an end, and he now lamented that he had not directly taken advantage of the opportunity to worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to go back home, back to Godhead. Significantly, Vasudeva has used the word mukti-dam to describe the Lord. Mukti-dam is a synonym of Mukunda, or that personality who can give liberation from the cycle of birth and death. It is stated in Vedic literature that even the demigods are bound to the cycle of birth and death, although their life span is inconceivably long by earthly calculations. It is the almighty God alone who can free the conditioned soul from the reactions to his previous sinful activities and award him an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Vasudeva lamented that he had desired K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to come to him as a son instead of desiring to go back to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, back to Godhead, to serve the Lord in the spiritual sky. Commenting on this incident in the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has emphasized that we should desire to go back home, back to Godhead, rather than try to bring the Lord to this world as our son. Nor can we artificially imitate the severe penances Vasudeva and Devak\u012b performed for thousands of heavenly years in their previous births as Sutap\u0101 and P\u1e5b\u015bni. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da states, \u201cIf we want to get the Supreme Personality of Godhead to become one of us in this material world, this requires great penance, but if we want to go back to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so\u00a0\u2019rjuna), we need only understand Him and love Him. Through love only we can very easily go back home, back to Godhead.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da goes on to explain that Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu freely bestows the benediction of love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which allows one to return to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode, through the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. This chanting process is far more effective in this age than artificial attempts to perform severe penances and austerities. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da concludes, \u201cTherefore, one need not undergo severe penances for many thousands of years. One need only learn how to love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be always engaged in His service (sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau svayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25). Then one can very easily go back home, back to Godhead. Instead of bringing the Lord here for some material purpose, to have a son or whatever else, if we go back home, back to Godhead, our real relationship with the Lord is revealed, and we eternally engage in our eternal relationship. By chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, we gradually develop our eternal relationship with the Supreme Person and thus attain the perfection called svar\u016bpa-siddhi. We should take advantage of this benediction and go back home, back to Godhead.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.3.38 purport) Although Vasudeva and Devak\u012b desired that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a become their son, it should be understood that they are devotees eternally situated in love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated by the Lord Himself (Bh\u0101g. 10.3.39), mohitau devam\u0101yay\u0101: Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, His pure devotees, were covered by His internal potency. In the Fourth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (4.1.20) the great sage Atri Muni prayed to the Lord, praj\u0101m \u0101tma-sam\u0101\u1e41 mahya\u1e41 prayacchatu: \u201cKindly be pleased to offer me a son exactly like You.\u201d Atri Muni said he wanted a son exactly like the Lord, and therefore he was not a pure devotee, because he had a desire to be fulfilled and that desire was material. If he had desired the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his child, he would have been completely free of material desires because he would have wanted the Supreme Absolute Truth, but because he wanted a similar child, his desire was material. Thus Atri Muni cannot be counted among the pure devotees. Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, however, did want the Lord Himself, and therefore they were pure devotees of the Lord. In this verse, therefore, Vasudeva\u2019s statement ap\u016bjaya\u1e41 na mok\u1e63\u0101ya mohito deva-m\u0101yay\u0101 should be taken to mean that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s internal potency bewildered Vasudeva so that he would desire K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his son. This paved the way for the Lord\u2019s appearance as the son of His loving devotees."

        "translation": "My dear lord, you are always true to your vow. Please instruct me clearly, so that by your mercy I may easily free myself from material existence, which is full of many dangers and keeps us constantly bound in fear.",
        "purport": " The word mucyema is significant here. In the previous verse Vasudeva stated that because he had been bewildered by the illusory energy of the Lord he could not achieve from the Supreme Personality of Godhead the boon of liberation. Therefore he is now approaching the pure devotee of the Lord, confident that by the mercy of the Lord\u2019s devotee he will certainly achieve liberation from material bondage. In this connection the words a\u00f1jas\u0101, \u201ceasily,\u201d and addh\u0101, \u201cdirectly,\u201d are very important. Although foolish persons proudly want to jump up directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead without accepting His pure devotee as spiritual master, those who are experienced in spiritual science know that by submission and service at the lotus feet of a pure devotee one directly contacts the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.17.27) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has stated, \u0101c\u0101rya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 vij\u0101n\u012by\u0101n n\u0101vamanyeta karhicit. Thus one should understand that the pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stands on the same spiritual level as the Lord Himself. This does not mean that a pure devotee is also God, but because of his intimate loving connection with the Lord, he is accepted by the Lord as being the Lord\u2019s very soul. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always in the heart of His pure devotee, and the pure devotee is always in the heart of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is eternally the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one without a second, the Lord is more pleased to see His pure devotee worshiped. Therefore the Lord says, \u0101c\u0101rya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 vij\u0101n\u012by\u0101t. One must offer the same respect to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava spiritual master as one would offer to the Lord. Therefore as soon as one pleases the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava spiritual master, one immediately pleases K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and makes spiritual advancement. The word a\u00f1jas\u0101 means that this bona fide process is the easiest method of achieving spiritual perfection. And because the pure devotee is a transparent medium, the word addh\u0101, \u201cdirectly,\u201d is used, indicating that service rendered to the pure devotee goes directly to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas service one whimsically offers to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly, bypassing the bona fide spiritual master, is not actually accepted and is therefore useless. Those who actually desire the highest perfection, that of going back home, back to the eternal, blissful kingdom of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, should study very carefully the example shown by \u015ar\u012b Vasudeva in these two verses. He indicates that although one cannot achieve liberation by directly worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can very easily achieve the perfection of life simply by a moment\u2019s association with a pure devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a such as N\u0101rada Muni, the exalted Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava saint among the demigods. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the word vi\u015bvato-bhay\u0101t indicates that Vasudeva very much feared the curse of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. As one can become perfect by worshiping the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, by displeasing the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas one can bring about all misfortune. Thus Vasudeva feared the curse delivered by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as at Pi\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101raka-t\u012brtha."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has commented that the word sad-dharma refers to bh\u0101gavata-dharma. This is also confirmed by \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b. Bh\u0101gavata-dharma is spiritually so powerful that even those who by worldly standards are implicated in various ways in sinful behavior can easily be purified by adopting any of the processes mentioned in this verse. In the practice of ordinary piety, one worships God with the expectation of receiving something in return for one\u2019s service. Similarly, the impersonalist aspires for his own liberation, wishfully thinking that he will become equal to God. In bh\u0101gavata-dharma, however, there is no such impurity. Bh\u0101gavata-dharma is devotional service to the Lord in which the only objective is the satisfaction of the Lord. If one rejects this process and instead wants to hear about, teach or meditate upon another process, the chance for immediate purification is lost. Neither ordinary materialistic yoga processes meant for achieving mystic powers nor impersonal processes based on speculation have the power to purify immediately those who have fallen into sinful behavior. Sad-dharma, or bh\u0101gavata-dharma, pure devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is unique in that even the most fallen souls can immediately rise to the highest perfectional stage by surrendering at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His pure devotee. This was vividly demonstrated in the preaching work of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, especially in the case of the sinful brothers Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i."

In the pages of the Bh\u0101gavatam we find true historical narrations relating to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the liberation of the conditioned souls. These historical accounts are not fiction or mythology, but describe the wonderful activities of the Lord and His devotees that took place in yugas previous to the advent of this puny age. Although mundane scholars have foolishly tried to depict the Bh\u0101gavatam as a mythological work or a recent creation, the actual fact is that \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is a perfect transcendental literature describing not only the entire situation of this universe but also that which lies far beyond this universe, in both the material and spiritual skies. If one seriously studies the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam he becomes the most learned intellectual man. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu desires that all pious persons become highly learned by hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and then preach the glories of the Lord in a scientific way all over the world. It is essential that we hear these historical narrations, such as the conversation between the nava-yogendras and King Videha, with complete faith and submission. Then, as stated in verse 12 of this chapter, even if our former life is filled with abominable activities, simply by hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam we shall be promoted to the same transcendental status as the Lord and His pure devotees. This is the extraordinary power of bh\u0101gavata history, as contrasted with useless, mundane historical accounts, which ultimately serve no purpose. Although mundane historians justify their work on the plea that we have to learn from history, we can practically see that the world situation is now rapidly deteriorating into unbearable conflict and chaos while so-called historians stand helplessly by. But the bh\u0101gavata historians who have faithfully heard \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam can give perfect and potent instructions for the restoration of a peaceful and blissful world. Therefore those who are inclined to enrich their intellectual life through the study of history should educate themselves in the historical narrations of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. This will bring them the perfection of intellectual and spiritual life."

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, it is clearly demonstrated in this and the following verse that the nine saintly sons of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva known as the nava-yogendras were situated in the highest stage of spiritual perfection, called p\u0101ramaha\u1e41sya-caritam, or \u201chaving fully developed the character of paramaha\u1e41sas.\u201d In other words, they were pure devotees of the Lord. According to \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b and J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the words \u0101tmano\u00a0\u2019vyatireke\u1e47a indicate that the nine sages saw the universe as being nondifferent from themselves as well as nondifferent from the Supreme Soul, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has additionally commented, \u0101tmana\u1e25 param\u0101tmana\u1e25 sak\u0101\u015b\u0101d avyatireke\u1e47a, vi\u015bvasya tac-chakti-mayatv\u0101d iti bh\u0101va\u1e25: \u201c\u0100tmana\u1e25 indicates the Supersoul. This universe is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param\u0101tm\u0101, since the entire universe is composed of His energy.\u201d Although it is stated here that the cosmic manifestation is nondifferent from both the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not think that either the living entity or the Supreme Lord is material. A Vedic aphorism states, asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25: \u201cThe living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead have nothing to do with the material world.\u201d Furthermore, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 says that the entire universe, consisting of eight gross and subtle elements, constitutes the bhinn\u0101 prak\u1e5bti, or apar\u0101 prak\u1e5bti \u2014 the separated, inferior energy \u2014 of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that He has eternally established His own abode in the kingdom of God, where life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, and that the living entity, being part and parcel of God, is also eternal (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25). Furthermore, once having gone to that eternal abode of the Lord the living entity never returns to this temporary manifestation (ya\u1e41 pr\u0101pya na nivartante tad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama). One may therefore ask why the living entity and the Supreme Lord are stated to be nondifferent from the material universe. The question is very nicely answered by \u015ar\u012bla N\u0101rada Muni in the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.20). Ida\u1e41 hi vi\u015bva\u1e41 bhagav\u0101n ivetaro yato jagat-sth\u0101na-nirodha-sambhav\u0101\u1e25: \u201cThe Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is Himself this cosmos, and still He is aloof from it. From Him only has this cosmic manifestation emanated, in Him it rests, and unto Him it enters after annihilation.\u201d Commenting on N\u0101rada\u2019s statement, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has very nicely explained this delicate philosophical point: \u201cFor a pure devotee, the conception of Mukunda, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is both personal and impersonal. The impersonal cosmic situation is also Mukunda because it is the emanation of the energy of Mukunda. For example, a tree is a complete unit, whereas the leaves and branches of the tree are emanated parts and parcels of the tree. The leaves and branches of the tree are also the tree, but the tree itself is neither the leaves nor the branches. The Vedic version that the whole cosmic creation is nothing but Brahman means that since everything is emanating from the Supreme Brahman, nothing is apart from Him. Similarly, the part-and-parcel hands and legs are called the body, but the body as the whole unit is neither the hands nor the legs. The Lord is the transcendental form of eternity, cognition and beauty. And thus the creation of the energy of the Lord appears to be partially eternal, full of knowledge and beautiful also.\u2026 \u201cAccording to the Vedic version, the Lord is naturally fully powerful, and thus His supreme energies are always perfect and identical with Him. Both the spiritual and the material skies and their paraphernalia are emanations of the internal and external energies of the Lord. External energy is comparatively inferior, whereas the internal potency is superior. The superior energy is living force, and therefore she is completely identical [with the Lord], but the external energy, being inert, is partially identical. But both the energies are neither equal to nor greater than the Lord, who is the generator of all energies; such energies are always under His control, exactly as electrical energy, however powerful it may be, is always under the control of the engineer. \u201cThe human being and all other living beings are products of His internal energies. Thus the living being is also identical with the Lord. But he is never equal or superior to the Personality of Godhead.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has clearly explained here that both the cosmic manifestation and the living entities are emanations from the Supreme Lord, as confirmed both in Ved\u0101nta-sutra and in the opening statement of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25: \u201cThe Absolute Truth is that from which everything emanates.\u201d Similarly, the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad states: The Supreme Lord, the Absolute Truth, is p\u016br\u1e47a, or complete in Himself. And since this cosmic world is a manifestation of His potency, it also appears to be p\u016br\u1e47a. In other words, because this material world is an emanation from the Supreme Lord, it is nondifferent from Him, exactly as the sun\u2019s rays are nondifferent from the sun globe, which is the source of their emanation. Similarly the living beings, who are expansions of the superior, or conscious, energy of the Supreme Lord, are also nondifferent from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although this nondifference is qualitative and not quantitative. The gold found in golden ornaments such as rings and bracelets is qualitatively identical with the gold in a mine, but the gold in the mine is quantitatively far superior to the tiny quantity of gold in a bracelet or ring. Similarly, although we are qualitatively one with God, being spiritual emanations of His unlimited potency, we are quantitatively infinitesimal and eternally subordinate to His supreme power. Therefore the Lord is called vibhu, or infinitely potent, and we are a\u1e47u, or infinitesimal and dependent. This is further confirmed in the Vedic literature by the statement nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m/ eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13). There are innumerable eternal living entities who are eternally and totally dependent upon the supreme singular living entity, the Supreme Lord. That dependence is not an illusion created by material existence, as stated by the impersonalist philosophers, but is an eternal relationship in which the Lord is eternally superior and we are eternally inferior. The Lord is eternally independent, and we are eternally dependent. The Lord is eternally absolute in Himself, and we are eternally relative to His supreme personality. Although the Lord is infinitely greater than any other living being, or than all of them combined, every living being is qualitatively nondifferent from the Lord, because all living beings are parts and parcels emanating from Him (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25). Therefore, in one sense, the living entity is also not different from the material cosmic manifestation, which is an inferior sister energy of the Lord. Both the living entity and the material nature are prak\u1e5bti, or feminine, dependent expansions of the supreme puru\u1e63a. The difference is that the living entity is the superior energy of the Lord, because the living entity is conscious and eternal like the Lord, whereas material energy is the inferior energy of the Lord, lacking consciousness and eternal form. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has emphasized in this regard that the absolute substance is one and is called Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supersoul. When one has achieved but a partial vision of the Param\u0101tm\u0101, one\u2019s understanding of life is called \u0101tma-dar\u015bana, or self-realization. And when even this partial understanding is lacking, one\u2019s existential condition is called an\u0101tma-dar\u015bana, or ignorance of the self. In the state of partial realization of the Supersoul, without recognition of the Param\u0101tm\u0101\u2019s distinction from the individual soul, the living entity tends to become puffed up by his spiritual achievement, be carried away by mental concoction, and consider himself equal in all respects with God. On the other hand, the living entity situated in an\u0101tma-dar\u015bana, or material ignorance, feels that he is completely different from the Supreme Lord; and since everyone in this material world is interested in himself, the living entity forgets about God, thinking that God is completely different from him and that there is therefore no substantial relationship between him and God. In this way the impersonal transcendentalists emphasize only the oneness between God and the living entity, whereas the ordinary materialists overemphasize the difference between God and the living entity. But Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has clearly revealed that the Ultimate Truth is simultaneous oneness and difference (acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva). Actually we are eternally different from God. Because the living entity and God are eternally separate individual entities, there exists the possibility of an eternal relationship. And because every living entity is qualitatively one with the Supreme Lord, that relationship constitutes the essence of the ultimate reality for every living being. As stated in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 20.108), j\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa.\u2019 The ultimate essential identity of every living entity is his relationship with the Supreme Lord as a servitor of the Lord. If one can understand that he is an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can correctly understand that both the living entity and the material universe are identical with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being emanations from Him, and that they are therefore nondifferent from each other. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b has stated, \u201cThe material world is a manifestation of simultaneous difference and nondifference, and it is a form of the Supreme Lord. Thus the temporary, perishable and ever-changing material world is different from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, the eternal world.\u201d It should be noted that in this verse the word sad-asad-\u0101tmakam, or \u201cmade up of gross and subtle objects,\u201d does not refer to material and spiritual objects. This universe is stated to be composed of sat and asat, gross and subtle material objects. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b, \u201cThe very subtle state within the manifest world is known as \u2018the unmanifest,\u2019 and the realm beyond the manifest world is called \u2018transcendental.\u2019 Within the coverings surrounding the manifest, in the region of the time factor, is the phase of material existence experienced by the controlling deities; in this phase exist the two functions: cause (asat) and effect (sat). In the universe, which is a third tattva, or reality (apart from and containing both sat and asat), and which is a form of the Supreme Lord, it is impossible to produce any contradiction to the nondual Absolute Truth.\u201d In other words, although ignorant, materialistic scientists may zealously carry out research to find a material principle that can negate or render unnecessary the existence of God, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b clearly states that since the universe is an emanation from the Lord and therefore spiritually identical with Him, there cannot possibly exist anywhere within the universe a material law, principle or phenomenon that in any way contradicts the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead. In fact, the entire universe, along with the spiritual sky, exists as eternal testimony to the unlimited glory of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. With this understanding, the nine Yogendras were traveling about the earth in transcendental bliss."

According to Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b the word yath\u0101rhata\u1e25 means yathocitam, or \u201caccording to the proper etiquette.\u201d It is clearly mentioned here that the nava-yogendras are n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101ya\u1e47a, exalted devotees of the Supreme Lord, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the word yath\u0101rhata\u1e25 indicates that the King worshiped the nine sages according to the standard Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava etiquette. The etiquette for worshiping exalted Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas is expressed by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura with the words s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d-dharitvena samasta-\u015b\u0101strai\u1e25: an exalted Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, being totally surrendered to the will of the Supreme Lord, is taken to be a transparent medium for the Lord\u2019s will. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is stated that even by a moment\u2019s association with the pure devotees of the Lord one can achieve all perfection in life. Therefore, as indicated by the word pr\u012bta\u1e25, King Nimi was overjoyed by the auspicious arrival of the sages, and therefore he worshiped them just as one would worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although impersonalist philosophers claim that every living entity is equal to God, they callously step over the heads of their so-called spiritual masters and freely speculate on the nature of the Absolute, giving their own whimsical opinions in defiance of the impersonal whims of their so-called gurus. In other words, although M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b impersonalists claim that everyone is God, they ultimately show an offensive mentality toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead in rejecting the reality of His eternal form and pastimes. Thus, they unwittingly belittle the eternal position of all living beings by denying their eternal personality and activities in the kingdom of God. The impersonalists, through their mental concoctions, try to minimize the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities who are part of Him, reducing them theoretically to a formless, nameless light, which by their concoction they claim to be the Absolute God. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, however, welcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead and easily understand that the unlimited Supreme Personality has nothing to do with the conditioned, limited, mundane personalities we find in the material world. The impersonalists arrogantly assume that there could not be any transcendental or unlimited personality beyond our present experience. But the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas intelligently understand that there are many wonderful things far beyond our limited experience. Therefore they accept the words of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.19): \u201cWhoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is the knower of everything, and he therefore engages himself in full devotional service, O son of Bharata.\u201d In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da states, \u201cThere are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord.\u2026 It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas.\u201d Therefore, exalted devotees such as the nine Yogendras always accept the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as expressed here by the word n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101n. King Nimi was a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, and therefore he worshiped the great sages with the same respect with which he would worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as shown by the word yath\u0101rhata\u1e25. Although impersonalists falsely claim that every living entity is equal to God, they cannot properly respect any living being, because of their original offense at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality. Their so-called worship, even of their own gurus, is ultimately self-serving and opportunistic. When an impersonalist imagines that he has become God, he has no further need for his so-called guru. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, however, because he accepts the supremacy of the eternal Personality of Godhead, is ready and willing to offer eternal respect to all living beings, especially to those most fortunate living beings who have achieved shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u2019s worship of the Lord\u2019s representative is not self-serving or opportunistic, but is an expression of eternal love for the Lord and His representatives, as indicated here by the word pr\u012bta\u1e25. Therefore it is clear from this verse that not only the nine exalted sons of \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva but also King Nimi himself were all great devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in defiance of the artificial and limited concept of impersonalism."

The Supreme Soul, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the original source of all light. His brilliantly glowing body is the source of the all-pervading brahmajyoti, the immeasurable spiritual light that is the resting place of innumerable universes (yasya prabh\u0101 prabhavato jagad-a\u1e47\u1e0da-ko\u1e6di). The individual soul, being part and parcel of the Lord, is also self-effulgent. In fact, everything in the kingdom of God is self-effulgent, as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.6): It has already been described in many ways that the nava-yogendras were pure devotees of the Lord. Being completely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious souls, they naturally radiated the intense effulgence of the soul, as indicated here by the word sva-ruc\u0101. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has also pointed out that the word brahma-putropam\u0101n, meaning \u201cequal to the sons of Brahm\u0101,\u201d indicates that the nava-yogendras were on the same spiritual platform as the four exalted Kum\u0101ra brothers.

Therefore it is stated here, p\u0101van\u0101ya caranti hi: the associates of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u travel throughout the universe to reclaim the fallen, conditioned souls on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A representative of the governor may be seen moving within the prison house, but that does not mean that the governor\u2019s representative has become a conditioned prisoner. It is understood that he is within the prison to negotiate the possible release of those prisoners who have rectified their criminal propensity. Similarly, the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead called parivr\u0101jak\u0101c\u0101ryas wander throughout the universe inviting everyone to surrender to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and go back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge.

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the word dehin\u0101m means bahavo deh\u0101 bhavanti ye\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 te, \u201cthe conditioned souls, who accept innumerable material bodies.\u201d According to some wishful thinkers a living entity in the human form of life will never be degraded to a lower form such as that of an animal or plant. But despite this wishful thinking, it is a fact that according to our activities at the present, we will be elevated or degraded by the laws of God. At the present time in human society there is no clear or precise understanding of the nature of life. Foolish scientists have invented highly sophisticated terminologies and theories to bluff innocent people into believing that life comes from chemical reactions. His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da has exposed this bluff in his book Life Comes from Life, which points out that although scientists claim that life comes from chemicals, they cannot produce so much as an insect, even from unlimited quantities of chemicals. Actually, life and consciousness are symptoms of the spirit soul. In Life Comes from Life (page 43), \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has stated, \u201cLiving beings move from one bodily form to another. The forms already exist. The living entity simply transfers himself, just as a man transfers himself from one apartment to another. One apartment is first class, another is second class, and another is third class. Suppose a person comes from a lower-class apartment to a first-class apartment. The person is the same. But now, according to his capacity for payment, or karma, he is able to occupy a higher-class apartment. Real evolution does not mean physical development, but development of consciousness.\u201d Within every species of life there is consciousness, and that consciousness is the symptom of the living entity, who is the superior energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without understanding this essential point of the transmigration of the conscious living entity throughout 8,400,000 species of life, one cannot possibly understand the words durlabho m\u0101nu\u1e63o deha\u1e25, \u201cthe human body is very rarely achieved.\u201d People are now being cheated of this essential understanding. They are completely unaware of the danger of slipping back into the eight million species that lie below the human species. It is natural that a human being think in terms of progress. We want to feel that our life is progressing and that we are advancing and improving the quality of our life. Therefore, it is urgent that people be informed of the great danger of misusing the valuable human life and that they know of the great opportunity the human life affords, the opportunity to take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Just as on earth different residential areas are divided into high class, middle class and low class, within the universe there are upper-class, middle-class and lower-class planets. By practice of the yoga system, or by meticulous execution of religious rituals, one can transfer himself to the higher planets within this universe. On the other hand, by neglecting religious principles one will degrade himself to a lower planet. But the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, declares in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.16), \u0101brahma-bhuvan\u0101l lok\u0101\u1e25 punar \u0101vartino\u00a0\u2019rjuna. Thus the final conclusion is that every planet within the material universe is an unsuitable and inappropriate residence, because on each planet there are the primal defects old age and death. The Lord assures us, however, that in His transcendental abode, which lies far beyond the material cosmos, life is everlasting, blissful and absolutely cognizant. The material world is temporary, troublesome and rife with ignorance, but the spiritual world, called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, is eternal, blissful and full of perfect knowledge. The highly evolved human brain is a gift given by God so that we may use our intelligence to distinguish between that which is eternal and that which is temporary. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.16): \u201cThose who are seers of the truth have concluded that matter has no permanent existence whereas the spirit soul never ceases to exist. Learned seers have concluded this by studying the nature of both.\u201d Those who have accepted the Supreme Lord and His abode as the ultimate goal of life are called vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-priya. Here King Nimi states that to have the personal association of such learned transcendentalists is certainly the perfection of human life. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura suggests that we consider the following verse: \u201c[The Supreme Lord said:] The best of bodies, a human body, is a great attainment, rarely achieved, and may be compared to a boat. The guru is an expert captain for this boat, and I have sent favorable winds (the Vedas). Thus I have given all facilities for crossing over the ocean of material existence. Any human being who has achieved these excellent facilities of human life but does not cross over the material ocean is to be considered the killer of his own self.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.20.17) According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b, the eternal servants of the Supreme Lord, being controlled by powerful feelings of mercy, descend into the material world as Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas to deliver the conditioned souls who are bound by the results of their own mundane work. Such Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas also distribute their mercy to those who are laboriously searching after the impersonal Absolute. \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni has stated that without ecstatic love of Godhead such laborious, impersonal contemplation of the Absolute is certainly troublesome (nai\u1e63karmyam apy acyuta-bh\u0101va-varjitam), and what to speak of the innumerable problems of ordinary gross materialistic life. We have practical experience that in the Western countries most people are working hard to get money, laboring under heavenly dreams of sense gratification. Others, having become frustrated with ordinary materialistic life, are trying to negate their personal existence and merge into the existence of God through so-called yoga and meditation. Both classes of unhappy people are receiving the mercy of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, putting aside their dreams of sense gratification as well as their troublesome impersonal speculation. They are learning to chant the holy names of God, dance in ecstasy, and feast on the holy food offered to the Lord. They become enlivened by the transcendental knowledge spoken by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.2), susukha\u1e41 kartum avyayam. The actual process of spiritual freedom is joyful to perform and has nothing to do with fruitive activities aimed at sense gratification or with dry impersonal speculation. More and more people are taking to the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, becoming joyful, and eagerly distributing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy to others. Thus the whole world will be enlivened and inspired by the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, which is the practical demonstration of the mercy of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas."

        "translation": "Therefore, O completely sinless ones, I ask you to kindly tell me what the supreme good is. After all, even half a moment\u2019s association with pure devotees within this world of birth and death is a priceless treasure for any man.",
        "purport": " The word \u015bevadhi\u1e25, or \u201ca great treasure,\u201d is significant in this verse. Just as an ordinary man is overjoyed to discover an unexpected treasure, one who is actually intelligent is overjoyed to gain the association of a pure devotee of the Lord, by which one\u2019s life can easily be perfected. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b the words \u0101tyantika\u1e41 k\u1e63emam, or \u201cthe supreme good,\u201d indicate that situation in which one cannot be touched by even the slightest fear. Now we are entangled in the cycle of birth, old age, disease and death (sa\u1e41s\u0101re). Because our entire situation can be devastated in a single moment, we are constantly in fear. But the pure devotees of the Lord can teach us the practical way to free ourselves from material existence and thus to abolish all types of fear. According to Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, normal etiquette would dictate that a host immediately ask a guest who has arrived about his well-being. But such an inquiry is unsuitable to place before self-satisfied devotees of the Lord, who are themselves the bestowers of all well-being. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha, the King knew that it would be useless to ask the sages about their business affairs, since the only business of the pure devotees of the Lord is the achievement of the supreme goal of life. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the goal of life is to free oneself from the cycle of birth and death and reinstate oneself as an eternal servant of God on the platform of spiritual bliss. Pure devotees of the Lord do not waste their time with ordinary mundane affairs. Sometimes foolish relatives of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava preacher lament that such a transcendental preacher has not used his life for material business and that so much money has therefore been lost by the practice of spiritual life. Such ignorant persons cannot imagine the unlimited prosperity available on the spiritual platform to those who have surrendered heart and soul to the mission of the Lord. King Nimi was himself a learned Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, and therefore he did not foolishly ask the sages about ordinary worldly affairs. He immediately inquired about \u0101tyantika\u1e41 k\u1e63emam, the highest, most perfect goal of life. According to Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the word anagh\u0101\u1e25, \u201cO sinless ones,\u201d has two meanings. Anagh\u0101\u1e25 indicates that the nine Yogendras were themselves completely free of sins. It also indicates that merely by the great fortune of seeing them and hearing from them submissively, an ordinary, sinful man could also be freed of his sins and achieve everything he desired. One might object that since the great sages had just arrived, the King should not have been so impatient as to inquire from them about the perfection of life. Perhaps the King should have waited until the sages themselves invited his inquiry. Such a hypothetical objection is answered by the words k\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101rdho \u2019pi. Even a single moment\u2019s association with pure devotees, or even half a moment\u2019s association, is sufficient to give one the perfection of life. An ordinary person who is offered a great treasure will immediately desire to claim such a treasure. Similarly, King Nimi was thinking, \u201cWhy should I consider myself fortunate enough to have such great sages stay here for a long time? Because I am an ordinary person, undoubtedly you will soon be leaving. Therefore, let me immediately take advantage of your holy association.\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b, in this world there are different varieties of mercy. But ordinary mercy cannot bring about the cessation of all unhappiness. In other words, there are many humanitarians, altruists and social reformers who certainly work for the betterment of humanity. Such persons are universally considered merciful. But in spite of their mercy, humanity continues to suffer in the grip of birth, old age, disease and death. I may distribute free food to the needy, but even after eating my merciful gift, the recipient will again become hungry, or he will suffer in some other way. In other words, by mere humanitarianism or altruism, people do not actually become free from unhappiness. Their unhappiness is merely postponed or altered. King Nimi was joyful upon seeing the nava-yogendras because he knew that they were eternally perfect associates of the Supreme Lord. Therefore he thought, \u201cYou are not prone to sinful activities like unfortunate mundane people such as me. Thus the words you speak carry no deception or exploitation.\u201d The materially conditioned souls spend their days and nights discussing various topics of sense gratification. They never find time to hear about transcendental knowledge. But if even only briefly or accidentally they hear hari-kath\u0101, topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the association of pure devotees of the Lord, their propensity to suffer in material existence will slacken. When one sees liberated persons, hears about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from them, remembers their saintly behavior and so on, one\u2019s tendency to bind himself in the illusion of sense gratification is diminished, and he becomes eager to serve the Supreme Lord."

When a living entity offers loving service to the Supreme Lord, the Lord is immediately satisfied, and in return He will give even His own self to the surrendered soul.",
        "purport": " Within the material world there are two classes of mundane philosophers who present their opinions about the Supreme Lord. Some so-called theologians claim that we are infinitely different from God, and therefore they tend to look upon the Lord as something far beyond our power to understand. Such extreme dualistic philosophers outwardly or officially claim to be pious and religious believers in God, but they consider God so much different from that which is within our experience that according to them there is little profit in even trying to discuss the personality or attributes of the Supreme Lord. Such outwardly faithful persons generally take to fruitive activities and gross materialistic sense gratification, being infatuated with the mundane relationships of the material world, which appear under the headings society, friendship and love. The advaita-v\u0101d\u012bs, or nondualistic philosophers, claim that there is no difference between God and the living entity and that the highest goal of life is to give up our personal existence, which is due to illusion, and merge into the impersonal Brahman effulgence, which is devoid of name, form, paraphernalia and personality. Thus neither class of speculative philosopher is able to understand the transcendental Personality of Godhead. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in His sublime teaching of acintya-bhed\u0101bhedha-tattva, or simultaneous oneness and difference, has clearly demonstrated that we are qualitatively one with God but quantitatively different. God is personal consciousness, and He has His personal form. Similarly we are also personal consciousness, and ultimately, when liberated, we also have eternal forms. The difference is that the eternal form and personality of the Supreme Lord contain unlimited potency and opulence whereas our potency and opulence are infinitesimal. We are conscious of our personal body, whereas Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Absolute Truth, is conscious of everyone\u2019s body, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a\u1e41 c\u0101pi m\u0101\u1e41 viddhi sarva-k\u1e63etre\u1e63u bh\u0101rata). But although God is infinitely greater than the living entity, both God and the living entities are eternal personalities with form, activities and feelings. The Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, expands Himself into innumerable living entities to enjoy rasas, or ecstatic relationships, with them. The living entities are part and parcel of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they are meant to serve Him with love. Although the Supreme Lord is eternally the predominator and the living entity is eternally the predominated, when the living entity surrenders unto the Lord with a sincere loving attitude, desiring to serve the Lord eternally without the slightest expectation of personal reward for such service, the Lord immediately is pleased, as expressed here by the word prasanna\u1e25. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is so unlimitedly merciful and magnanimous that in His gratitude to such a surrendered and loving servitor, He is immediately inclined to offer anything, even Himself, to His surrendered devotee. There are numerous practical, historical examples of this loving propensity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of the love of Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in His form as D\u0101modara, surrendered Himself to His loving mother and allowed Himself to be bound with ropes as a childhood punishment. Similarly, feeling indebted to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas for their intense love for Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His form as P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi happily agreed to drive the chariot of Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Similarly, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is always thinking of ways to satisfy the gop\u012bs, who are universally recognized as the most exalted loving devotees of the Lord. Such intense loving feelings exchanged between the Lord and His pure devotees would not be possible were the living entities not qualitatively one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and indeed inseparable parts and parcels of the Lord. On the other hand, because both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities are eternally individuals, each with his own eternal individual consciousness, such loving exchanges are a perpetual reality in the kingdom of God. In other words, absolute oneness with God and absolute difference from God are theoretical imaginations of different schools of speculative philosophy. The perfection of spiritual love, as described in this verse, is based on simultaneous oneness and difference, and this absolute reality was elaborately presented by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in His brahminical incarnation as Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. The followers of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu have expounded this perfect doctrine in innumerable books, culminating in the teachings of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da, who has most perfectly presented this knowledge in a way that is understandable not only in India but to all the people of the world. Our present insignificant attempt is simply to complete his translation and commentary on \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and we are constantly praying for his guidance so that this work can simply be completed exactly as he would have desired. If one can understand these teachings of Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu as they are being presented in Western languages, surely the Lord will be satisfied with such a sincere seeker of spiritual truth."

        "purport": " In the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b the word asad-\u0101tma-bh\u0101v\u0101t in this verse indicates that the living entity is constantly disturbed by fear because he identifies his eternal self with the temporary material body and its paraphernalia. Similarly, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has stated, bhakti-pratik\u016bla-deha-geh\u0101di\u1e63v \u0101saktim. Because of one\u2019s attachment to one\u2019s temporary body and so-called home, family, friends and so on, one\u2019s intelligence is always disturbed by fear, and one is unable to appreciate or practice pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. So-called religious activities executed in the bodily conception of life are always accompanied by fear and anxiety about the ultimate result. But pure devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead frees one from fear and anxiety because it is executed on the platform of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, or the spiritual plane, where there is no fear or anxiety. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the process of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that even in the stage of s\u0101dhana-bhakti, in which one is practicing devotional service through rules and regulations, the neophyte can have a direct experience of fearlessness by the mercy of the Lord. As one\u2019s devotional service becomes mature, the Lord reveals Himself to the devotee, and all fear is totally vanquished forever. Every living entity has a natural propensity to serve God, but because of false identification with the temporary body one loses touch with this pure, constitutional propensity and instead inauspiciously becomes attached to temporary sense gratification in the form of body, home, family and so on. The result of such false attachment is continuing distress, which can be eradicated only by devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b has quoted the following verse: \u201cO my Lord, the people of the world are embarrassed by all material anxieties \u2014 they are always afraid. They always try to protect wealth, body and friends, they are filled with lamentation and unlawful desires and paraphernalia, and they avariciously base their undertakings on the perishable conceptions of \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018mine.\u2019 As long as they do not take shelter of Your safe lotus feet, they are full of such anxieties.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.9.6)"

        "translation": "Even ignorant living entities can very easily come to know the Supreme Lord if they adopt those means prescribed by the Supreme Lord Himself.

        "purport": " There are many Vedic scriptures, such as Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, that present standard injunctions for the peaceful management of human society. Such Vedic knowledge is based on the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, which scientifically divides human society into four occupational divisions as well as four spiritual divisions. According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, however, knowledge that can bring one directly in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called ati-rahasyam, or the most confidential knowledge (ati-rahasyatv\u0101t sva-mukhenaiva bhagavat\u0101vidu\u1e63\u0101m api pu\u1e41s\u0101m a\u00f1ja\u1e25 sukhenaiv\u0101tma-labdhaye). Bh\u0101gavata-dharma is so confidential that it is spoken by the Lord Himself. The essence of bh\u0101gavata-dharma is given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, wherein K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally instructs Arjuna. Yet in the Eleventh Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam the Lord will give instructions to Uddhava that surpass even the teachings given to Arjuna in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has stated, \u201cUndoubtedly Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken by the Lord on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra just to encourage Arjuna to fight, and yet to complete the transcendental knowledge of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord instructed Uddhava. The Lord wanted Uddhava to fulfill His mission and disseminate knowledge which He had not spoken even in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.4.32 purport) Similarly, it is understood that the knowledge that will be presented here by the nine Yogendras is not their personal concoction but is authorized knowledge originally spoken by the Lord Himself. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b, the living entities, in the course of their wanderings throughout the cycle of birth and death, lose all trace of the Personality of Godhead. But when they hear the eternally auspicious topics spoken by the Supreme Lord for their benefit and understand their eternal identities as spirit souls, the realized experience of being an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes the basis of bh\u0101gavata-dharma. In the soul\u2019s experience as a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or servant of God, there is no consideration of being different from God or the same as God, nor is one interested in the kingdom of material sense gratification. The pure devotee simply perceives his particular devotional service to the Supreme Lord and sees himself as an individual part and parcel of the ultimate shelter. A pure devotee experiences that his very being is tied, by ropes of loving devotion, to the ultimate shelter Himself in one of His direct personal expansions. And in such a perfect state of consciousness, the devotee can perceive the all-pervading variegated forms of the Absolute Truth."

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the word a\u00f1ja\u1e25 (\u201ceasily\u201d), which is used in the previous verse, is explained in this verse. He states, a\u00f1ja\u1e25-padenokta\u1e41 su-karatva\u1e41 viv\u1e5b\u1e47oti: \u201cBy the word a\u00f1ja\u1e25 the ease of performing bhakti-yoga is established, and this will be elaborated in the present verse.\u201d In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.2) the Lord Himself states, pratyak\u1e63\u0101vagama\u1e41 dharmya\u1e41 susukha\u1e41 kartum avyayam: \u201cThe process of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternal, and it is very joyfully and naturally performed.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da comments, \u201cThe process of devotional service is a very happy one. Why? Devotional service consists of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized \u0101c\u0101ryas. Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says, patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phalam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many instances of this in history. Simply by tasting the tulas\u012b leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kum\u0101ra became great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.\u201d The essential point to be understood here is that when a living entity surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he tells the Lord, \u201cMy dear Lord, although I am most sinful and unqualified and for so long have been trying to forget You, now I am taking shelter at Your lotus feet. From this day on I am Yours. Whatever I possess \u2014 my body, mind, words, family, riches \u2014 I am now offering at Your lotus feet. Please do with me as You like.\u201d The Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has repeatedly given assurance in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that He will protect and redeem such a surrendered living entity, bringing him back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life in the Lord\u2019s own kingdom. Thus the qualification of surrendering to the Lord is so great and spiritually potent that even if a surrendered soul is deficient in other aspects of pious life, his elevated status is protected by the Lord Himself. In other processes, however, such as yoga, because one depends upon his own determination and intelligence and does not actually seek shelter of the Lord, one is subject to fall at any moment, being protected only by one\u2019s own flimsy, limited potency. Therefore, as stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.2.32), \u0101ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25/ patanty adho\u00a0\u2019n\u0101d\u1e5bta-yu\u1e63mad-a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25: if one gives up the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and instead tries to advance in the yoga process by one\u2019s own determination, or if one tries to make progress in knowledge by one\u2019s own speculative power, surely one will eventually fall again to a mediocre material platform, having no protection other than one\u2019s own fallible strength. Therefore the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas, in their commentaries on this verse, have illustrated in various ways the vast superiority of bhakti-yoga, or pure devotional service. In this connection, \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b states, nim\u012blya netre dh\u0101vann api iha e\u1e63u bh\u0101gavata-dharme\u1e63u na skhalet; nim\u012blana\u1e41 n\u0101m\u0101j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41, yath\u0101hu\u1e25 \u2014 \u2018\u015bruti-sm\u1e5bt\u012b ubhe netre vipr\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 parik\u012brtite/ ekena vikala\u1e25 k\u0101\u1e47o dv\u0101bhy\u0101m andha\u1e25 prak\u012brtita\u1e25\u2019 iti. \u201cEven if running with both eyes closed, a devotee on this path of bh\u0101gavata-dharma will not stumble. \u2018Closing one\u2019s eyes\u2019 refers to being in ignorance [of standard Vedic literatures]. As it is said, \u2018The \u015bruti and sm\u1e5bti scriptures are the two eyes of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Lacking one of them, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is half blind, and deprived of both he is considered completely blind.\u2019\u201d In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10-11) the Lord has clearly stated that even if a devotee is lacking in Vedic knowledge or ignorant of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava literature, the Lord personally enlightens him from within his heart if the devotee is actually engaged in loving service to the Lord. In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da states, \u201cWhen Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion, but even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u201d Yet this facility given by the Lord cannot justify unauthorized concoctions put forward about the process of devotional service in the name of spontaneous devotion. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has stated, bhagavat-pr\u0101pty-artha\u1e41 p\u1e5btha\u1e45-m\u0101rga-kara\u1e47a\u1e41 tv ati-d\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101vaham eva: \u201cIf one manufactures his own process of devotional service for the sake of attaining the Supreme Lord, such a concoction will cause total ruination.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura goes on to quote: \u201cIf one\u2019s so-called unalloyed devotion to Lord Hari does not take into account the regulations of the \u015bruti, sm\u1e5bti, Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, it is nothing more than a disturbance to society.\u201d In other words, even if one is not learned in the Vedic literatures, if he is engaged in the loving service of the Lord he is to be accepted as a pure devotee; nonetheless, such loving devotion cannot in any way contradict the injunctions of revealed scriptures. Such groups as the pr\u0101k\u1e5bta-sahajiy\u0101s ignore the standard regulations of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava dharma and engage in illicit, degraded activities, dressing as R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the name of spontaneous devotion. They claim that because such spontaneous devotion is revealed by the Lord Himself, they need not refer to standard scriptures. Similarly, all over the world there are pseudoreligionists who manufacture their own processes and claim they are receiving knowledge from the Lord Himself within their hearts. Therefore it is very important to understand, as stated here, that spontaneous revelation by the Lord within the heart is meant not to alter the eternal process of devotional service to the Lord, but to give a supplementary facility to a sincere devotee who is ignorant of revealed scriptures. In other words, the revealed scriptures describe the eternal process of service to the Lord. Since the Lord is eternal and the living entity is eternal, the process of their loving relationship is also eternal. The Lord never changes His essential nature, nor does the living entity. Therefore there is no need to change the essential process of loving service to the Lord. Special revelation by the Lord is meant to give scriptural knowledge by another means, and not to contradict scriptural knowledge. On the other hand, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has stated that if a devotee is executing all the basic principles of bhakti-yoga and advancing in devotional service, such a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should not be criticized for neglecting the secondary procedures. For example, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da established hundreds of spiritual communities in the Western countries for practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The devotees in these communities give up all illicit sex, gambling, intoxication and meat-eating and constantly engage in service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such followers of \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da are able to make wonderful spiritual advancement and convert many thousands of people to the process of devotional service. In fact, all the faithful members of ISKCON who follow the standard regulations remain free from material contamination and make visible progress in going back home, back to Godhead. Such members of ISKCON cannot possibly execute all the details of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma system. In fact, many Western devotees can barely pronounce Sanskrit words and are not very expert in performing elaborate sacrifices based on chanting of mantras and offering of oblations. But because they are executing all the essential principles of bhakti-yoga by giving up material sense gratification and constantly engaging in loving service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, their position is guaranteed both in this life and in the next. We have seen many sophisticated Sanskrit scholars and learned experts in the details of Vedic sacrifice who can hardly even follow the basic principles of human life, namely no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling and no intoxication. Such brilliant scholars and ritualistic performers are generally seen to be attached to a materialistic conception of life and are fond of mental speculation. Although in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord Himself has given perfect knowledge for all time, such so-called scholars consider themselves more intelligent than the Lord and thus speculate on the meaning of Vedic literature. Such speculation certainly constitutes a fall from perfect spiritual life, and what then is to be said of materialistic fruitive activities, which are illusory in every sense of the term. The transcendental devotees are able to remain aloof from the pollution of fruitive activity and mental speculation, and that is the essential purport of this verse. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has warned that the words y\u0101n \u0101sth\u0101ya indicate that the exalted status of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava can never be accorded to one who is not following the basic regulations of bhakti-yoga. Nor can it apply to one who is sometimes serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and sometimes serving the illusory energy, m\u0101y\u0101, by mental speculation or fruitive activities. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has concluded, \u201cIn all dharmas other than bh\u0101gavata-dharma one must consider the conditioned soul\u2019s qualification. But a soul surrendered to the Lord is never confounded by error, even if unqualified in all other respects. His feet never stumble, and he never falls. Even though wandering in the world at whim, he always resides in an auspicious place by the influence of his unswerving worship. The unique potency of bhagavata-dharma does not appear in any of the other dharmas of the world. There is no comparison between a surrendered individual who has taken shelter of bh\u0101gavata-dharma and the practitioner of any other dharma.\u201d"

        "translation": "In accordance with the particular nature one has acquired in conditioned life, whatever one does with body, words, mind, senses, intelligence or purified consciousness one should offer to the Supreme, thinking, \u201cThis is for the pleasure of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\u201d",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has commented in this regard that a person who engages all the sensory activities of his body, mind, words, intelligence, ego and consciousness in the service of the Supreme Lord cannot be considered to be on the same level as a karm\u012b working for his personal sense gratification. Although apparently still a conditioned soul, one who offers the fruits of all his activities to the Lord can no longer be touched by the countless miseries that arise from the reactions to materialistic activities. Because of enmity against the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His omnipotent authority, the conditioned living entity performs activities against the order of the Lord. Yet self-realized souls continue to perform all types of work within this world to carry out the mission of the Supreme Lord. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, those karm\u012bs who are sufficiently pious follow the example of the self-realized souls by trying to offer the fruits of their own duties at the lotus feet of the Lord. Although this is counted as karma-mi\u015br\u0101 bhakti, or devotional service mixed with the desire to execute fruitive activities, such mixed devotional service is gradually transformed into pure devotional service. As the pious fruitive workers disengage themselves, step by step, from the bogus philosophy of \u201cenjoyment of one\u2019s hard-earned rewards,\u201d pure devotional service rewards them with complete good fortune. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has commented, \u0101tman\u0101 citten\u0101ha\u1e45k\u0101re\u1e47a v\u0101 anus\u1e5bto ya\u1e25 svabh\u0101vas tasm\u0101t: although one may still be in the bodily concept of life, he should offer the fruit of his work to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those with a primitive, materialistic concept of the Supreme Lord consider the Lord present only in a temple or church. They make some offering to the Lord in the place of worship, but in their normal activities they claim proprietorship, not thinking that God is present everywhere and within everyone. We have practical experience of many so-called religious men who become very offended if their children try to become servants of the Supreme Lord. They feel, \u201cGod should be pleased with whatever humble offering I give Him, but my family and ordinary business affairs belong to me and are under my control.\u201d The perception of anything as separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His proprietorship is called m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has quoted, na kevala\u1e41 vidhita\u1e25 k\u1e5btam eveti niyama\u1e25; svabh\u0101v\u0101nus\u0101ri laukikam api: \u201cThe regulation that one should serve the Supreme Lord does not refer only to prescribed religious paths, ceremonies and regulations; rather, all the activities one performs in this world according to one\u2019s personal nature should be dedicated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d The words karoti yad yat sakala\u1e41 parasmai n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101yeti samarpayet tat in this verse are very significant. A similar verse is found in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.27): \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, and all the austerities that you perform should be done as an offering unto Me.\u201d The objection may be raised, Since our ordinary activities are performed with a material body and material mind, not by the spirit soul, how can such activities be offered to the Supreme Lord, who is completely transcendental to the material world? How can such activities be considered spiritual? In answer to this it is stated in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (3.8.8): One who wants to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, must accept the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma and worship the Lord through the execution of his prescribed duties. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13) the Supreme Lord has personally taken credit for establishing the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma: c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25. Therefore if one offers his work within the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma system to the Supreme Lord, such work is counted as devotional service. According to one\u2019s svabh\u0101va, or nature, one may work as an intellectual or priest, as an administrator or military man, as an agriculturist or mercantile man, or as a laborer or craftsman. And while working, everyone should meditate on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking, yat sakala\u1e41 parasmai n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101ya: \u201cI am working for the Supreme Lord. Whatever result comes from my work, I shall accept the bare minimum for my personal maintenance, and the rest I shall offer for the glorification of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has pointed out, k\u0101min\u0101\u1e41 tu sarvathaiva na du\u1e63karm\u0101rpa\u1e47am: one cannot offer du\u1e63karma, or sinful, wicked activities, to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The four pillars of sinful life are illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Such activities are never acceptable as offerings to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example may be given that although in a free society each person is allowed to choose his own occupation, even a democratic government will not allow a citizen to choose the occupation of thief or murderer. In the same way, according to the laws of God one is invited to work according to his own nature in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, but one is forbidden to adopt a criminal life of sinful activities violating the laws of God. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has given a nice description of how one should offer one\u2019s ordinary activities to the Supreme Lord. He says that an ordinary sense gratifier begins his activities in the morning by passing stool and urine, cleaning his mouth, brushing his teeth, bathing, meeting his friends and family members and discussing with them the day\u2019s business. In this way one has so many activities during the day, and a sense gratifier executes all these activities for his personal material enjoyment. A karm\u012b, on the other hand, working under the jurisdiction of the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas, will perform the same activities for the pleasure of the demigods and his forefathers. Thus, according to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a devotee of the Supreme Lord, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, should similarly perform all of his daily activities for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. In this way everything we do throughout the day will become bhakty-a\u1e45ga, or a supplementary aspect of our devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It should be understood that as long as one identifies oneself in terms of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma system rather than as part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one is still on the platform of aha\u1e45k\u0101ra, or false ego, because the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system is designed according to the modes of nature acquired by the living entity through his material body. But the \u0101c\u0101ryas have emphasized in their commentaries on this verse that such a false ego, by which one identifies oneself as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, \u015b\u016bdra, sanny\u0101s\u012b, g\u1e5bhastha and so on, should also be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, when one becomes very much attracted to hearing and chanting about the Supreme Lord and not merely offering Him the fruits of one\u2019s work, one has attained the stage called svar\u016bpa-siddh\u0101 bhakti, or the stage in which actual devotion becomes visible. The example may be given that although any good citizen will pay his taxes to the government, he may not necessarily love the government or its leaders. Similarly a pious living entity can understand that he is working under the laws of God, and therefore in accordance with Vedic injunctions or the injunctions of other scriptures he offers a portion of his assets to the Supreme Lord in religious ceremonies. But when such a pious person actually becomes attached to chanting and hearing about the personal qualities of the Lord and when love thus becomes visible, he is considered to be reaching the mature stage of life. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has quoted several verses that very nicely show the development of love for Godhead. Anena durv\u0101san\u0101-du\u1e25kha-dar\u015banena sa karu\u1e47\u0101-maya\u1e25 karu\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 karotu: \u201cMay the merciful Lord show mercy on me by demonstrating the misery created by sinful desires.\u201d Y\u0101 pr\u012btir avivek\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 visaye\u1e63v anap\u0101yin\u012b/ tv\u0101m anusmarata\u1e25 s\u0101 me h\u1e5bday\u0101n n\u0101pasarpatu: \u201cUnintelligent persons have unflinching affection for the objects of sense gratification. Similarly, may I always remember You, so that that same attachment, applied to You, never leaves my heart.\u201d (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 1.20.19) Yuvat\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 yath\u0101 y\u016bni y\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 ca yuvatau yath\u0101/ mano\u00a0\u2019bhiramate tadvan mano me ramat\u0101\u1e41 tvayi: \u201cAs the minds of young girls take pleasure in thinking of a young boy and those of young boys take pleasure in thinking of a young girl, may my mind take pleasure in You.\u201d Mama sukarma\u1e47i du\u1e63karma\u1e47i ca yad r\u0101ga-s\u0101m\u0101nyam, tad sarvato-bh\u0101vena bhagavad-vi\u1e63ayam eva bhavatu: \u201cWhatever attraction I have for pious or sinful activities, let that attraction be wholeheartedly invested in You.\u201d"

        "translation": "Fear arises when a living entity misidentifies himself as the material body because of absorption in the external, illusory energy of the Lord. When the living entity thus turns away from the Supreme Lord, he also forgets his own constitutional position as a servant of the Lord. This bewildering, fearful condition is effected by the potency for illusion, called m\u0101y\u0101. Therefore, an intelligent person should engage unflinchingly in the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord, under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, whom he should accept as his worshipable deity and as his very life and soul.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b the objection may be raised that since fear is caused by ignorance, it can be dispelled by knowledge and there is no need to worship the Supreme Lord. The living entity falsely identifies with his material body, family, society and so on, and he simply has to give up this false identification. Then what will m\u0101y\u0101 be able to do? In reply to this argument, \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has quoted the following verse from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): \u201cThis divine energy of Mine consisting of the three modes of material nature is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.\u201d The living entity, called j\u012bva-tattva, is one of the potencies of the Supreme Lord, but the constitutional position of the living entity is ta\u1e6da-stha, or marginal. Being minute, every living entity is eternally dependent upon the supreme living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is confirmed in the Vedic literature as follows: nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101\u1e41/ eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n. \u201cAmong all the eternally conscious beings there is one supreme eternal living being who is supplying the needs of all the innumerable others.\u201d (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.1.12) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja has stated, ekale \u012b\u015bvara k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u0101ra saba bh\u1e5btya: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only independent controller; all other living entities depend upon Him.\u201d (Cc. \u0100di 5.142) Just as the finger is part and parcel of the body and therefore must always be engaged in bodily service, we as parts and parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25) have the eternal duty (san\u0101tana-dharma) of engaging in the unalloyed service of the Lord. The potency of the Lord that enlightens us in the Lord\u2019s service is called cit-\u015bakti. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments that when the living entity develops a spirit of independence he is forced to come to the material world, where he enters into various types of petty and undesirable behavior that create a fearful situation for him. The bahira\u1e45g\u0101-\u015bakti, the illusory potency of the Supreme Lord, covers all trace of the cit-\u015bakti and imposes one material body after another upon the living entity for his gross sinful enjoyment. As further punishment, the living entity who has given up his loving relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loses all power to perceive the eternal, blissful form of the Supreme Lord, who is his actual shelter. Instead the living entity becomes attached to many temporary, phantasmagorical forms, such as his personal body, the bodies of his family members and friends, his nation, his city, with its buildings and cars, and innumerable types of ephemeral material scenery. In such a state of gross ignorance the idea of returning to one\u2019s original identity no longer even crosses the mind. By the laws of God the three modes of material nature are constantly in conflict, as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. This conflict is described in many places in the Bh\u0101gavatam as gu\u1e47a-vyatikaram. When the living entity is bewildered by the interactions of the modes of material nature, he comes to the conclusion of relativity and assumes that God and worship of God are simply by-products of the relative, contradictory interactions of nature\u2019s modes. In the name of anthropological, sociological or psychological perspective, the living entity falls deeper and deeper into the darkness of materialistic ignorance, dedicating himself to mundane piety, economic development, sense gratification, or speculation in which he regards the Absolute as lacking variety and personality, which he assumes to be products of the interactions of nature\u2019s modes. The illusory potency of the Supreme Lord is duratyay\u0101; it is impossible to escape without the direct mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te). The example may be given that when the sun is covered by clouds, no man-made apparatus can remove them from the sky, but the sun itself, which created the clouds, can immediately burn away the cloudy covering and reveal itself. Similarly, when we become covered by the illusory potency of the Lord we identify with our temporary material body, and thus we are always in fear and anxiety. But when we surrender to the Lord Himself, He can immediately free us from this illusion. The material world is pada\u1e41 pada\u1e41 yad vipad\u0101m; it is dangerous at every step. When a living entity understands that he is not the material body but an eternal servant of God, his fear is vanquished. As stated by \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, atra bhaktai\u1e25 sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-bandh\u0101n na bhetavya\u1e41 sa hi bhaktau pravartam\u0101nasya svata ev\u0101pay\u0101ti: \u201cIn this bh\u0101gavata-dharma devotees have no need to fear the bondage of material existence. That fear goes away of its own accord for one who engages in devotional service.\u201d It is important to make clear that bhayam, or fear, cannot ultimately be vanquished simply by impersonal self-realization as expressed by the words aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi, \u201cI am spirit soul.\u201d In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.12) N\u0101rada Muni says to Vy\u0101sadeva, nai\u1e63karmyam apy acyuta-bh\u0101va-varjita\u1e41 na \u015bobhate: mere nai\u1e63karmyam, or cessation of material activities and repudiation of the bodily concept of life, cannot ultimately save one. The living entity must find a superior shelter on the spiritual platform; otherwise he will come back to the fearful situation of material existence. That is stated in \u015b\u0101stra: \u0101ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25 patanty adho\u00a0\u2019n\u0101d\u1e5bta-yu\u1e63mad-a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.2.32). Although one may with great labor and effort struggle up to the Brahman platform (kle\u015bo\u00a0\u2019dhikataras te\u1e63\u0101m avyakt\u0101sakta-cetas\u0101m), if he does not find a suitable shelter he will come back to the material platform. His so-called liberation is vimukta-m\u0101na, liberation by imagination. The living entity is by nature pleasure-seeking, \u0101nanda-maya. Now we are suffering because we are falsely seeking pleasure on the material platform and as a result we are becoming entangled in the painful complexities of material existence. But if we try to give up the pleasure-seeking propensity altogether, we shall eventually become frustrated and return to the platform of material pleasure-seeking. Although there is eternal existence on the Brahman platform of impersonal realization, there is no \u0101nanda. Variety is the mother of enjoyment. In the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets there is actual, spiritual \u0101nanda. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is there in His ecstatic, spiritual form, surrounded by His blissful associates, all of them eternally full of bliss and knowledge. They have nothing to do with material existence. In the spiritual planets even the scenery and birds and animals are fully conscious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and are absorbed in transcendental bliss. Yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante tad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama (Bg. 15.6). One who goes to the blissful, spiritual planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be fully satisfied and never come back to the material platform. Therefore Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has said, ki\u1e41 c\u0101tra bhaktai\u1e25 sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-bandh\u0101n na bhetavyam. Only the bhakta actually becomes free from fear. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has emphasized the necessity of accepting a bona fide spiritual master who is vrajendranandana-pre\u1e63\u1e6dha, the dearmost servitor of the son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The bona fide spiritual master is completely free from envy of other living entities, and therefore he freely distributes knowledge of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the living entities who are inimical to the service of the Lord somehow hear this knowledge submissively, they become free from the illusory potency of the Lord, which has covered them and thrown them into various miserable species of life. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, by the mercy of the spiritual master the faithful disciple gradually realizes the transcendental position of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, who is served with great awe and reverence by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. As the disciple\u2019s transcendental knowledge gradually increases, even the paramai\u015bvarya, or supreme opulence, of the Lord of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha becomes pale in the light of the beauty of Govinda, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Govinda has inconceivable potency to enchant and give pleasure, and by the mercy of the spiritual master the disciple gradually develops his own blissful relationship (rasa) with Govinda. Having understood the blissful pastimes of Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, \u015ar\u012b S\u012bt\u0101-R\u0101ma, Rukmi\u1e47\u012b-Dv\u0101rak\u0101dh\u012b\u015ba and finally Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, the purified living entity is given the unique privilege of participating directly in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who becomes his only object and shelter."

        "translation": "Although the duality of the material world does not ultimately exist, the conditioned soul experiences it as real under the influence of his own conditioned intelligence. This imaginary experience of a world separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be compared to the acts of dreaming and desiring. When the conditioned soul dreams at night of something desirable or horrible, or when he daydreams of what he would like to have or avoid, he creates a reality that has no existence beyond his own imagination. The tendency of the mind is to accept and reject various activities based on sense gratification. Therefore an intelligent person should control the mind, restricting it from the illusion of seeing things separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when the mind is thus controlled he will experience actual fearlessness.",
        "purport": " Although the conditioned mind is bewildered by the objects of sense gratification offered by m\u0101y\u0101, illusion, if one takes to the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord such material sense gratification gradually dissipates, for it is merely a mental concoction of the conditioned soul. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has emphasized by the words avyabhic\u0101ri\u1e47\u012b bhakti that one cannot dissipate the illusion of material sense gratification unless one takes to the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. As \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated: Unalloyed devotional service cannot be mixed with material sense gratification or mental speculation. The servant must act only for the satisfaction of the master. Similarly, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. One must see only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere and must act exclusively for the satisfaction of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the eternal master of every living entity. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted several verses from the Hari-va\u1e41\u015ba illustrating that the living entity bewildered by identifying with his material body, home, family, friends and so on and thus entangled in the cycle of birth and death accepts phantasmagoria as reality. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtan\u0101di-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-m\u0101tratva\u1e41 yato na vy\u0101hanyeta: if one seriously desires to vanquish the duality of material illusion, one must adopt the process of chanting and hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also cited the following Vedic reference: According to Vedic literatures the living entities of this Kali-yuga are very feeble in their power to understand spiritual knowledge (mand\u0101\u1e25 sumanda-matayo manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101 hy upadrut\u0101\u1e25). Their minds are always disturbed, and they are lazy and misguided by so many bogus leaders. They are further described in the Bh\u0101gavatam as ni\u1e25sattv\u0101n (impatient and impious), durmedh\u0101n (possessed of weak intelligence) and hrasit\u0101yu\u1e63a\u1e25 (very short lived). Therefore one who seriously wants to overcome the ignorance of material life must surrender to the process of chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 as well as reciting and rendering submissive aural reception to the transcendental literatures presented by the Lord, such as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta. It should be understood that the living entity is completely spiritual and never actually becomes mixed with material energy (asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25). According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, tasmin \u015buddhe\u00a0\u2019pi kalpyate: although the living entity is \u015buddha, pure spirit soul, he imagines that he is a material creation and thus entangles himself in the network of illusion called deh\u0101patya-kalatr\u0101di. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has used the word m\u0101nasa-pratyak\u1e63a to describe the experience of material life. M\u0101nasa-pratyak\u1e63a means \u201cthat which is experienced only within the mind.\u201d The actual pratyak\u1e63a is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.2): When one submissively hears the instructions given by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which constitute the king of all knowledge (r\u0101ja-vidy\u0101) and the most confidential of all information (r\u0101ja-guhyam), by associating with such spotless spiritual knowledge (pavitram idam uttamam) one can directly experience one\u2019s eternal nature (pratyak\u1e63\u0101vagamam). By experiencing one\u2019s eternal nature, one becomes thoroughly religious (dharmyam), blissful (susukham) and eternally engaged in the devotional service of the Lord (kartum avyayam). \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has quoted the following \u015bruti-mantra in this connection: vijita-h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bka-v\u0101yubhir ad\u0101nta-manas turagam. \u201cBy the very senses and life air one has conquered, the uncurbed mind will again drag one away.\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura the meaning of this verse is samavah\u0101ya guro\u015b cara\u1e47am: if one rejects the lotus feet of one\u2019s spiritual master, all of one\u2019s previous spiritual advancement becomes null and void. This has already been indicated in the previous verse by the words guru-devat\u0101tm\u0101. Unless one accepts a bona fide spiritual master in the authorized parampar\u0101 as one\u2019s worshipable deity and life and soul, there is no question of overcoming the duality of material life. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has made the following comments on this verse. \u201cControl of the mind is a result of living a life of devotional service to the Lord. By the influence of fixed devotional service, the accepting and rejecting mind can stop its thirst for sensory enjoyment apart from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In transcendental K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness there is no contradiction, pettiness or lack of ecstasy. In other words, it is not like a material object, which always proves temporary and constantly miserable. Having forgotten K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the conditioned living entity is suffering the misdirection and perversion of his own so-called intelligence. The living entities are fragmental parts of the supreme shelter, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but have fallen from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s kingdom of spiritual pastimes. Because of forgetting the Supreme Lord, they become prone to sinful life and turn their attention to dangerous material objects, which fill them with constant fear. If one desires to subdue the mind, which is constantly engaged in the duality of mental concoction, one must take to the devotional service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d"

The holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are all-auspicious because they describe His transcendental birth and activities, which He performs within this world for the salvation of the conditioned souls. Thus the holy names of the Lord are sung throughout the world.",
        "purport": " Since the holy names, forms and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unlimited, no one can hear or chant about all of them. Therefore the word loke indicates that one should chant the holy names of the Lord that are well known on this particular planet. Within this world, Lord R\u0101ma and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very famous. Their books, R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, are studied and relished all over the world. Similarly, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is gradually becoming famous all over the world, as He Himself predicted. P\u1e5bthiv\u012bte \u0101che yata nagar\u0101di gr\u0101ma/ sarvatra prac\u0101ra haibe mora n\u0101ma: \u201cIn every town and village on this earth the glories of My name will be chanted.\u201d Therefore in conformity with the authorized statement of this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement emphasizes the mah\u0101-mantra \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 along with the Pa\u00f1ca-tattva mah\u0101-mantra: \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-caitanya prabhu-nity\u0101nanda \u015br\u012b-advaita gad\u0101dhara \u015br\u012bv\u0101s\u0101di-gaura-bhakta-v\u1e5bnda. According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, this blissful process of chanting the holy names of the Lord without any material conception is called sugama\u1e41 m\u0101rgam, a very enjoyable path. Similarly, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has described the process of bhakti-yoga as susukha\u1e41 kartum, very joyfully performed, and \u015ar\u012bla Locana d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has sung, saba avat\u0101ra s\u0101ra \u015biroma\u1e47i kevala \u0101nanda-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s process for worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is kevala \u0101nanda-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, simply joyful. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has stated that people in any part of the world can assemble, chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, read from authorized books such as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is, and accept k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101dam sumptuously, just as Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu did in Navadv\u012bpa. To be successful in this program, however, Locana d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has warned, vi\u1e63aya ch\u0101\u1e0diy\u0101: one must give up material sense gratification. If one indulges in material sense gratification, surely he will be in the bodily concept of life. One who is in the bodily concept of life will undoubtedly have a materialistic understanding of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, by considering the Lord\u2019s pastimes mundane, one will come within the category of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da, or impersonalism, in which one considers the transcendental body of the Lord to be a creation of material nature. Therefore the word asa\u1e45ga\u1e25 in this verse is very significant. One must chant the holy name of the Lord without mental speculation. One must accept Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He presents Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, wherein He states that He alone is Puru\u1e63ottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that His transcendental form is eternal (ajo\u00a0\u2019pi sann avyay\u0101tm\u0101). \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has emphasized, y\u0101ni \u015b\u0101stra-dv\u0101r\u0101 sat-parampar\u0101-dv\u0101r\u0101 ca loke g\u012bt\u0101ni janm\u0101ni karm\u0101\u1e47i ca, t\u0101ni \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47van g\u0101ya\u1e41\u015b ca: if one wants to be successful in chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord, one must adopt the process as it is coming down in the sat-parampar\u0101, the transcendental disciplic succession. And the sat-parampar\u0101 can be identified by reference to bona fide Vedic scriptures. Contrary to the opinion of uninformed critics, the followers of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are not mindless or fanatical. They intelligently follow the system of checks and balances called guru, s\u0101dhu and \u015b\u0101stra. That is, one must accept a bona fide spiritual master, who must in turn be confirmed by the opinion of great saintly persons and revealed scriptures. If one accepts a bona fide spiritual master, follows the example of great saintly persons and becomes conversant with authorized literature such as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, one\u2019s program of chanting the holy names of the Lord and hearing about the Lord\u2019s pastimes will be completely successful. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in the material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has stated that throughout the world the Supreme Lord is known by many names, some of them expressed in vernacular language, but any name used to indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is one without a second, beyond the influence of material nature, can be accepted as a holy name of God, according to this verse. That is indicated by the word loke. One should not misinterpret the word vicaret, \u201cone should wander,\u201d to mean that while chanting the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one may go anywhere or engage in any activity without discrimination. Therefore it is stated, vicared asa\u1e45ga\u1e25: one may wander freely, but at the same time one must strictly avoid the association of those who are not interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or who are engaged in sinful life. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has stated, asat-sa\u1e45ga-ty\u0101ga \u2014 ei vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ra (Cc. Madhya 22.87): a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is known by his complete avoidance of all mundane association. If in the course of traveling and chanting the glories of the Lord a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava preacher finds a submissive nondevotee who is willing to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the preacher will always give his merciful association to such a person. But a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should strictly avoid those who are not interested in hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, those who do not engage in hearing the astonishing pastimes and holy names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who do not relish the Lord\u2019s pastimes are simply executing mundane, illusory activities or indulging in false, materialistic renunciation. Frustrated living entities sometimes take to dry impersonalism and avoid the descriptions of the Supreme Lord\u2019s eternal name, form, qualities, entourage and pastimes. But if one gains the association of a pure devotee, one gives up the path of dry speculative argument and becomes situated on the actual Vedic path of devotional service to the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that the word dvaita, or \u201cduality,\u201d expresses the false understanding that some object has a substantial existence independent of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da conception of advaita, which lacks any spiritual distinctions, is simply another manifestation of the mind\u2019s function of acceptance and rejection. The eternal appearance and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead never contradict the concept of advaya-j\u00f1\u0101na, or transcendental knowledge beyond duality."

        "translation": "By chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord, one comes to the stage of love of Godhead. Then the devotee is fixed in his vow as an eternal servant of the Lord, and he gradually becomes very much attached to a particular name and form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As his heart melts with ecstatic love, he laughs very loudly or cries or shouts. Sometimes he sings and dances like a madman, for he is indifferent to public opinion.",
        "purport": " In this verse, pure love of God is being described. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has described this spiritual situation as sampr\u0101pta-prema-lak\u1e63ana-bhakti-yogasya sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-dharm\u0101t\u012bt\u0101\u1e41 gatim, or the perfectional stage of life in which one\u2019s devotional service to the Supreme Lord is enriched by ecstatic love. At that time, one\u2019s spiritual duties are entirely beyond the scope of worldly affairs. In \u015ar\u012b Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 7.78), there is the following statement by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: \u201cWhile chanting the holy name of the Lord in pure ecstasy, I lose myself, and thus I laugh, cry, dance and sing just like a madman.\u201d Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu immediately approached His spiritual master to ask him why He had apparently become mad by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His guru replied: \u201cIt is the nature of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra that anyone who chants it immediately develops his loving ecstasy for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d (Cc. \u0100di 7.83) In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has commented, \u201cThese symptoms are very prominently manifest in the body of a pure devotee. Sometimes when our students of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement chant and dance, even in India people are astonished to see how these foreigners have learned to chant and dance in this ecstatic fashion. As explained by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, however, actually this is not due to practice, for without extra endeavor these symptoms become manifest in anyone who sincerely chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has warned us in this regard about the ungodly sahajiy\u0101s who imitate the pastimes of the Supreme Lord in an unauthorized way, neglecting the standard injunctions of Vedic scriptures, foolishly trying to take the position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Puru\u1e63ottama, and thus making a cheap farce of the exalted pastimes of the Lord. Their so-called ecstatic symptoms like crying, shivering and falling on the ground are not to be confused with the advanced features of devotional service described by \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b as sampr\u0101pta-prema-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-bhakti-yoga. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da comments in this regard, \u201cOne who has attained this bh\u0101va stage is no longer under the clutches of the illusory energy.\u201d Similarly, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja states: \u201cFor a devotee who has actually developed bh\u0101va [love of Godhead], the pleasure derived from dharma, artha, k\u0101ma and mok\u1e63a appears like a drop in the presence of the sea.\u201d (Cc. \u0100di 7.85) As already stated in the previous verse of this chapter, g\u0101yan vilajjo vicared asa\u1e45ga\u1e25: one exhibits the ecstatic symptoms of love of Godhead when he is asa\u1e45ga, free from all attachment to material sense gratification. The word loka-b\u0101hya\u1e25 in this verse indicates that a pure devotee on the platform of prema, love of Godhead, is not at all concerned with ridicule, praise, respect or criticism from ordinary people in the bodily concept of life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when He reveals Himself to a surrendered servant, all doubt and speculation about the nature of the Absolute are vanquished forever. In this connection \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted a verse from the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cSome devotees of the Lord exhibit external symptoms, acting like madmen, others are introspective devotees, and still others partake of both natures. It is by one\u2019s steadfastness and by the merciful vibrations emanating from one\u2019s mouth that one\u2019s devotion can be judged, not otherwise.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has given a very nice example to illustrate ecstatic laughing and other symptoms of love of Godhead: \u201c\u2018Oh, that thief K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the son of Ya\u015bod\u0101, has entered the house to steal the fresh butter. Grab Him! Keep Him away!\u2019 Hearing these menacing words spoken by the elderly gop\u012b Jarat\u012b, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately prepares to leave the house. The devotee to whom this transcendental pastime is revealed laughs in ecstasy. But suddenly he can no longer see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He then cries in great lamentation, \u2018Oh! I achieved the greatest fortune in the world, and now it has suddenly slipped from my hands!\u2019 Thus the devotee cries loudly, \u2018O my Lord! Where are You? Give me Your answer!\u2019 The Lord answers, \u2018My dear devotee, I heard your loud complaint, and so I have again come before you.\u2019 Upon seeing Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a again, the devotee begins to sing, \u2018Today my life has become perfect.\u2019 Thus overwhelmed with transcendental bliss, he begins to dance like a madman.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also notes that the word druta-citta\u1e25 or \u201cwith a melted heart,\u201d indicates that one\u2019s heart, melted by the fire of anxiety to see the Lord, becomes like Jamb\u016bnad\u012b, a river of roseapple juice. The \u0101c\u0101rya further points out, n\u0101ma-k\u012brtanasya sarvotkar\u1e63am: the present and previous verse clearly distinguish the exalted position of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, chanting and hearing the name and glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also emphasized this by quoting: \u201cIn this Age of Kali there is no alternative, there is no alternative, there is no alternative for spiritual progress but the holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord.\u201d In his purports to Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 7.76), \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has given an elaborate explanation of this verse. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura recommends that we study the following verse in this connection: \u201cLet the garrulous populace say whatever they like; we shall pay them no regard. Thoroughly maddened by the ecstasy of the intoxicating beverage of love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we shall enjoy life running about, rolling on the ground and dancing in ecstasy.\u201d (Pady\u0101val\u012b 73)"

Thus seeing everything that exists within creation as the body of the Supreme Lord, Hari, the devotee should offer his sincere respects to the entire expansion of the Lord\u2019s body.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has given this example from the Pur\u0101\u1e47as: yat pa\u015byati, tat tv anur\u0101g\u0101ti\u015bayena \u201cjagad dhana-maya\u1e41 lubdh\u0101\u1e25 k\u0101muk\u0101\u1e25 k\u0101min\u012b-mayam\u201d iti-vat hare\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bram. \u201cBecause of a greedy person\u2019s obsession with money, wherever he goes he sees an opportunity for acquiring wealth. Similarly a very lusty man notices women everywhere.\u201d In the same way, a pure devotee should see the transcendental form of the Lord within everything, since everything is an expansion of the Lord. It is our practical experience that a greedy man will see money everywhere. If he goes to the forest he will immediately consider whether it would be profitable to purchase the forest land and sell the trees to a paper mill. Similarly, if a lusty man goes to the same forest he will look everywhere for beautiful women tourists who might happen to be there. And if a devotee goes to the same forest he will see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there, knowing correctly that the entire forest, as well as the sky canopy above, is the inferior energy of the Lord. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is supremely sacred, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and since everything that exists expands directly or indirectly from the body of the Lord, everything is sacred when seen through the eyes of a self-realized person. Therefore as stated in this verse, pra\u1e47amet: one should offer one\u2019s sincere respects to everything. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has mentioned that we should see the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere. This verse does not approve of the impersonal, atheistic philosophy that everything is God. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted from the Hari-va\u1e41\u015ba: \u201cBecause everything is under the control of the Supreme Lord, Hari, everything is considered to be His body. He is the original source and master of everything, and therefore nothing should be seen as different from Him. Nonetheless, one should not foolishly conclude that there is absolutely no difference between the material universe and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is full of His own unique spiritual qualities.\u201d The example is often given of the sun and the sun\u2019s rays. The sunshine is nothing but an expansion of the sun globe, and therefore there is no qualitative difference between the sun and its rays. But although the sunshine is situated everywhere and although everything is a transformation of the sun\u2019s energy, the sun globe itself, the source of the sunshine, is not everywhere, but is situated in a particular place in the vast sky and has its own specific form. If we penetrate further into the sun globe we shall find the sun-god, Vivasv\u0101n. Although pseudointellectuals of the modern age who are incapable of even counting the hairs on their own heads will consider the sun-god a mythological figure, it is actually the foolish mythology of modern men to think that such a sophisticated apparatus as the sun, which provides heat and light for the entire universe, can function without intelligent administration. Transformations of solar energy make life possible on earth, and thus the earth can be understood to consist of an endless variety of secondary manifestations of all-pervading solar energy. So within the sun planet is the personality Vivasv\u0101n, the chief administrator of the solar functions; the sun globe itself is localized; and the sun\u2019s rays expand everywhere. Similarly \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u015ay\u0101masundara, is the original Personality of Godhead (bhagav\u0101n svayam); He expands Himself as the localized Supersoul (Param\u0101tm\u0101) in everyone\u2019s heart; and finally He expands His potency by His personal bodily glow, the all-pervading spiritual effulgence called the brahmajyoti. The entire material manifestation floats within the rays of this brahmajyoti. Just as all life on earth is a transformation of the all-pervading rays of the sun, the entire cosmic manifestation is a transformation of the spiritual rays of the brahmajyoti. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.40): \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes.\u201d Therefore, the brahmajyoti is the spiritual light that emanates directly from the body of the Lord. This universe is a transformation of that spiritual energy, and therefore everything that exists is in one sense connected directly with the personal body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is emphasized here that we should offer respect to everything that exists, recognizing it to be the energy of the Lord. The example may be given that if a man is important his property is also important. The president of a country is the most important person in the country, and therefore everyone must respect his property. Similarly, everything that exists is an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should be respected accordingly. If we fail to see everything that exists as the energy of the Lord, we risk the danger of drifting into the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy, which according to Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is the most deadly poison for one trying to advance in actual spiritual life. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101di-bh\u0101\u1e63ya \u015bunile haya sarva-n\u0101\u015ba (Cc. Madhya 6.169). If we try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a alone, without the expansion of His potency, we shall not understand such statements in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam and aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25. As already explained in this chapter, bhaya\u1e41 dvitiy\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101t: fear or illusion arises from thinking that there is something not dependent upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now, in this verse, the specific process for overcoming this fearful illusion is given. One must train one\u2019s mind to see everything that exists as an expansion of the potency of the Supreme Lord. By offering respects to everything and meditating upon everything as part of the body of the Lord, one will become free from fear. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29), suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the well-wishing friend of every living being. As soon as one understands that everything that exists is under the powerful control of one\u2019s most beloved friend, one comes to the stage in which the whole universe becomes a blissful abode (vi\u015bva\u1e41 p\u016br\u1e47a-sukh\u0101yate), because he sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personality were not the source of everything and if everything were not connected to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one might be proper in concluding that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personality is a material manifestation of some impersonal truth. As stated in Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25: the Absolute Truth is that from which everything emanates. Similarly, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25: \u201cI am the source of everything.\u201d If we see anything totally disconnected from the personal body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we may doubt whether K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personality is actually the absolute source described in Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. As soon as one feels this way, he becomes fearful and should be understood to be under the control of the Lord\u2019s illusory energy. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has warned us that if we do not see everything as a manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we shall become victims of phalgu-vair\u0101gya, or immature renunciation. Whatever we see as disconnected from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will have in our mind no relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. But if we see everything as connected to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we shall use everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s satisfaction. This is called yukta-vair\u0101gya. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, \u201cOne who has experienced his own true identity understands that all things exist as paraphernalia for giving ecstatic pleasure to the Supreme Lord. Thus one becomes free from the separatist vision in which one sees the world as existing for one\u2019s own enjoyment. In the transcendental state, whatever a devotee sees reminds him of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus his transcendental knowledge and bliss increase.\u201d Because the impersonalist philosophers fail to see everything as belonging to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they reject this world as having no true existence (jagan mithy\u0101). But since the material world is an emanation from the supreme reality, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it does in fact exist. Its nonexistence is simply a creation of the imagination, and one cannot possibly act on such an imaginary platform. Therefore, having proposed an illusory theory and being unable actually to live on such a platform, the impersonalist comes back to the material platform for altruistic or gross sense gratificatory activities. Since the impersonalist does not accept the personal proprietorship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he does not know how or for whom to engage the things of this world, and since it is impossible to reject this world totally while living within it, he runs the risk of again becoming entangled in material fruitive activities. Therefore as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (12.5), kle\u015bo\u00a0\u2019dhikataras te\u1e63\u0101m: the impersonal path of imaginary philosophy is very painful to follow. The conclusion is that this verse is spoken to help the devotee of the Supreme Lord advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It can be understood from the previous verses of this chapter that the ultimate goal is pure devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one falsely interprets this verse to sanction the imaginary M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy that everything is God, one will simply become bewildered and fall from the path of spiritual advancement."

        "translation": "Devotion, direct experience of the Supreme Lord, and detachment from other things \u2014 these three occur simultaneously for one who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the same way that pleasure, nourishment and relief from hunger come simultaneously and increasingly, with each bite, for a person engaged in eating.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has explained this analogy as follows: Bhakti, or devotion, may be compared to tu\u1e63\u1e6di (satisfaction) because they both take the form of pleasure. Pare\u015b\u0101nubhava (experience of the Supreme Lord) and pu\u1e63\u1e6di (nourishment) are analogous because both sustain one\u2019s life. Finally, virakti (detachment) and k\u1e63ud-ap\u0101ya (cessation of hunger) may be compared because both free one from further hankering so that one may experience \u015b\u0101nti, or peace. A person who is eating not only becomes uninterested in other activities but increasingly becomes uninterested in the food itself, according to his satisfaction. On the other hand, according to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, although one who is experiencing the blissful Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, becomes uninterested in anything other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a increases at every moment. Therefore it is to be understood that the transcendental beauty and qualities of the Supreme Lord are not material, since one never becomes satiated by relishing the bliss of the Supreme Lord. The word virakti\u1e25 is very significant in this verse. Virakti means \u201cdetachment,\u201d whereas ty\u0101ga means \u201crenunciation.\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the word renunciation can be used in a situation in which one considers giving up an enjoyable object. But by considering everything to be potential paraphernalia in the service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as described in the previous verse, one need not give thought to renunciation, for one uses everything in the proper way in the service of the Lord. Yukta-vair\u0101gyam ucyate. The very pleasant analogy of a good meal is given in this verse. A hungry man busily consuming a sumptuous plate of food is not interested in anything else happening around him. In fact, he considers any other topic or activity a disturbance to his concentration on the delicious meal. Similarly, as one advances in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one considers anything unrelated to the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a an obnoxious disturbance. Such concentrated love of Godhead has been described in the Second Canto of the Bh\u0101gavatam by the words t\u012bvre\u1e47a bhakti-yogena yajeta puru\u1e63a\u1e41 param (Bh\u0101g. 2.3.10). One should not make an artificial show of renouncing the material world; rather, one should systematically train the mind to see everything as an expansion of the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as a hungry materialistic man, upon seeing sumptuous food, immediately desires to put it in his mouth, an advanced devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, upon seeing a material object, immediately becomes eager to use it for the pleasure of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without the spontaneous hunger to engage everything in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and to dive deeper and deeper into the ocean of love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, so-called realization of God or loose talk about so-called religious life is irrelevant to the actual experience of entering the kingdom of God. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the path of bhakti-yoga is so joyful and practical that even in the stage of s\u0101dhana-bhakti, in which one follows rules and regulations without an advanced understanding, one can perceive the ultimate result. As stated by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.187): As soon as one surrenders to the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (prapadyam\u0101nasya), giving up all other activities (viraktir anyatra ca), one is immediately to be considered a liberated soul (j\u012bvan-mukta\u1e25). The Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is so merciful that when a living entity understands that the personality K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of everything and surrenders to the Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally takes charge of him and reveals to him within his heart that he is under the Lord\u2019s full protection. Thus devotion, direct experience of the Personality of Godhead, and detachment from other objects become manifest even in the beginning stage of bhakti-yoga, since bhakti-yoga begins at the point of liberation. Other processes have as their final goal salvation or liberation, but according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): If one surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one is immediately liberated and thus begins his career as a transcendental devotee with complete confidence in the Lord\u2019s protection."

        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.71): \u201cA person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and who is devoid of false ego \u2014 he alone can attain real peace.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da comments, \u201cTo become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. In other words, desire for becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is actually desirelessness.\u201d There is a similar statement in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 19.149): \u201cBecause a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is desireless, he is peaceful. Fruitive workers desire material enjoyment, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs desire liberation, and yog\u012bs desire material opulence; therefore they are all lusty and cannot be peaceful.\u201d Generally there are three classes of living entities afflicted with selfish desire. These are the bhukti-k\u0101m\u012b, mukti-k\u0101m\u012b and siddhi-k\u0101m\u012b. Bhukti-k\u0101m\u012b refers to those ordinary persons who desire money and everything money can buy. Such a primitive mentality is based on the desire to enjoy money, sex and social prestige. When a living being becomes frustrated with this hallucination, he takes to the path of speculative philosophy and analytically tries to track down the source of illusion. Such a person is called mukti-k\u0101m\u012b because he desires to negate material illusion and merge into an impersonal spiritual state, free from anxiety. The mukti-k\u0101m\u012b is also motivated by personal desire, although the desire is somewhat more elevated. Similarly the siddhi-k\u0101m\u012b, or the mystic yog\u012b who desires the spectacular powers of mystic yoga, such as reaching one\u2019s hand across the world or making oneself smaller than the smallest or lighter than the lightest, is also infected by material or selfish desire. Therefore it is said, sakali \u2018a\u015b\u0101nta.\u2019 If one has any personal desire, whether it be material, philosophical or mystic, he will be a\u015b\u0101nta, or ultimately frustrated, because he will see himself as the central object of satisfaction. This egocentric concept is in itself illusory and therefore ultimately frustrating. On the other hand, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-bhakta ni\u1e63k\u0101ma, ataeva \u2018\u015b\u0101nta\u2019: a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ni\u1e63k\u0101ma; he has no personal desire. His only desire is to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord \u015aiva himself has praised this outstanding quality of the pure devotees of the Lord by stating: \u201cA person who is devoted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, is not afraid of anything. Elevation to the heavenly kingdom, condemnation to hell and liberation from material bondage all appear the same to a devotee.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 6.17.28) Although the impersonalist philosopher proposes that everything is one, the devotee of the Lord is actually tuly\u0101rtha-dar\u015b\u012b, or empowered with the vision of oneness. The devotee sees everything as the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and therefore desires to engage everything in the service of the Lord, for the Lord\u2019s satisfaction. Since the devotee does not see anything as dvit\u012bya, or outside the scope of the Lord\u2019s potency, he is happy in any situation. Having no personal desire, the devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually \u015b\u0101nta, or peaceful, because he has achieved the perfection of life, love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is actually situated in his eternal constitutional position under the direct shelter and protection of the omnipotent Parame\u015bvara, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, this verse ends the answer given by the first of the nine Yogendras, Kavi, to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nimi\u2019s first question, \u201cWhat is the highest good?\u201d"

But now King Nimi asks how to make further distinctions among the servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that the first-class, second-class and lower-class Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas can be clearly identified. According to \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47eti yasya giri ta\u1e41 manas\u0101driyeta: \u201cOne should mentally honor any devotee who chants the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d (Upade\u015b\u0101m\u1e5bta 5) Any living entity who is faithfully chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to be considered a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and at least within the mind is to be offered respect. But for practical advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one should associate at least with a second-class devotee. And if one can receive the mercy of a first-class devotee of the Lord, one\u2019s perfection is very easily guaranteed. Thus Nimi Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is humbly inquiring, \u201cWhat are the character, behavior and speech of devotees?\u201d The King wants to know the particular symptoms of body, mind and speech by which the different categories uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b, madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b and kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b are clearly identified. In response to the King\u2019s inquiry, another of the nava-yogendras, namely Havir, will give a further elaboration of the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Consequently he sees everything in relation to the Supreme Lord and understands that everything that exists is eternally situated within the Lord.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.30) the Lord says: \u201cFor one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor is he ever lost to Me.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da comments, \u201cA person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness certainly sees Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere, and he sees everything in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knowing that everything is the manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. Nothing can exist without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Lord of everything \u2014 this is the basic principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u201d The qualification for seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere is stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38): \u201cI worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of \u015ay\u0101masundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.\u201d A devotee of the highest level of spiritual qualification is glorified for the expansiveness of his spiritual vision. For example, when the stalwart demon Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu questioned his self-realized son Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja as to the whereabouts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Prahl\u0101da, being a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, or pure devotee, answered straightforwardly that the Supreme Lord is everywhere. The demoniac father then asked if God was in the pillar of the palace. When Prahl\u0101da answered yes, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, being a bona fide demon, struck the pillar with his sword, trying to kill God, or at least disprove His existence. Then Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, the most ferocious form of the Supreme Lord, immediately appeared and finished forever the illicit program of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. Thus Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja can be accepted as an uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b devotee. A pure devotee is completely free from the tendency to enjoy things separately from the Lord\u2019s service. He does not see anything in the universe as unfavorable, because he sees everything as the expanded potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee\u2019s purpose in existing is to give pleasure somehow or other to the Supreme Lord. Thus everything that a pure devotee experiences, moment by moment, increases his ecstatic loving desire to satisfy the transcendental senses of the Lord. The three modes of material nature torment the conditioned soul, who absorbs his mind in the separated, material energy of the Lord. The function of this separated energy, bhinn\u0101 prak\u1e5bti, is to take the living entity away from the reality, which is that everything is within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is within everything. Being covered by gross ignorance, the bewildered conditioned soul believes that only the objects of his own limited vision actually exist. Sometimes such foolish persons speculate that if a tree falls in a forest with no one to hear it, there will actually be no sound. The conditioned souls do not consider that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is all-pervading, there is no question of no one\u2019s hearing; the Lord always hears. As stated in the Thirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.14), sarvata\u1e25 \u015brutimal loke: the Supreme Lord hears everything. He is upadra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101, the witness of everything (Bg. 13.23). In this verse the word bh\u0101gavatottama\u1e25, \u201cthe most advanced devotee,\u201d indicates that there are those who are not gross materialists but who are not the highest devotees. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, those who cannot properly distinguish between devotees and nondevotees and who therefore never worship the pure devotees of the Lord are to be known as kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012bs, devotees on the lowest stage of devotional service. Such kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012bs engage in worship of the Supreme Lord, especially in the temple, but are indifferent to the Lord\u2019s devotees. Thus they misunderstand this statement by Lord \u015aiva in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cO Dev\u012b, the most exalted system of worship is the worship of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Greater than that is the worship of tad\u012bya, or anything belonging to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da comments on this verse, \u201c\u015ar\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. Similarly the most confidential servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the spiritual master, and all devotees of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are tad\u012bya. The sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, guru, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and things used by them must be considered tad\u012bya, and without a doubt worshipable by all living beings.\u201d (Cc. Madhya 12.38 purport) Typically the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b is eager to engage his materialistic qualifications in the service of the Lord, mistaking such material expertise to be the sign of advanced devotion. But by continuing to serve the Supreme Lord and the devotees engaged in propagating the Lord\u2019s mission, the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b also advances in his realization and comes to the stage of dedicating his activities to helping more advanced Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Even such kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012bs can help ordinary living entities by their association, since at least the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012bs have faith that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of this faith, the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b gradually becomes inimical to those who are opposed to the Lord. As he gradually becomes more and more inimical to those who hate the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and becomes more attracted to friendship with other faithful servants of the Lord, the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b approaches the second-class stage, called madhyama. In the madhyama stage the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sees the Lord as the cause of all causes and the chief goal of everyone\u2019s loving propensity. He sees the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas as his only friends within this morbid world and is eager to bring innocent people within the shelter of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava society. Also, a madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b strictly avoids associating with the self-proclaimed enemies of God. When such an intermediate qualification becomes mature, the concept of supreme qualification begins to present itself; that is, one comes to the stage of uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b. A kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b guru, one who is simply attached to performing religious ceremonies and worshiping the Deity, without appreciation for other Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, especially those who are preaching the message of the Lord, will especially appeal to persons interested in the dry cultivation of knowledge. As a living entity develops mundane piety, he proudly devotes himself to regulated work and nobly tries to detach himself from the fruits of his work. Through such regulated detached work, knowledge or wisdom gradually arises. As knowledge or wisdom becomes prominent, the pious materialist becomes attracted to altruistic and charitable work and gives up gross sinful activities. If he is fortunate, he then becomes favorable to the transcendental devotional service of the Lord. Desiring a mere intellectual understanding of devotional service, such a pious materialist may seek shelter at the feet of a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b. If able to advance to the madhyama qualification, he then becomes attracted to a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava actively engaged in preaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And when fully mature on the platform of intermediate devotion, he becomes attracted to the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata level and is awarded a glimpse of the exalted position of the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata spiritual master by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within his heart. If one gradually goes on in the devotional service of the Lord, one becomes established as a paramaha\u1e41sa mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata. At this stage all of his actions. movements and engagements in preaching are dedicated solely to the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The illusory potency, m\u0101y\u0101, has no power to throw or cover such a purified living entity. In Upade\u015b\u0101m\u1e5bta (5) \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has described this stage of life as bhajana-vij\u00f1am ananyam anya-nind\u0101di-\u015b\u016bnya-h\u1e5bdam. A mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, being empowered by the Supreme Lord, Yoge\u015bvara, is endowed with the supernatural power to inspire and give success to the madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b who follows in his footsteps and to elevate a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b gradually to the intermediate platform. Such devotional power springs automatically from the ocean of mercy found within the heart of a pure devotee. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura points out that a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata has no desire to inflict punishment on the enemies of the Lord. Rather, he engages the madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012bs and kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012bs in preaching work to purify the polluted mentality of the inimical souls, who are falsely imagining the material world to be separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are unfortunate living entities who are unable to understand the glory of a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b within the realm of devotional service, have no praise for the more advanced state of intermediate devotion and cannot even begin to understand the most exalted stage, that of the uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b. Such unfortunate souls, attracted to impersonal M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da speculation, follow faithfully in the footsteps of Ka\u1e41sa, Agha, Baka and P\u016btan\u0101 and are thus killed by \u015ar\u012b Hari. In this way the community of sense gratifiers remains uninterested in service at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, and according to the individual perverted vision of so-called self-interest, each materialist chooses his own misfortune in the form of repeated birth and death in various types of material bodies. There are 8,400,000 species of material forms, and the materialistic living entities select the particular flavors of birth, old age, disease and death they wish to inflict upon themselves under the hallucinations of so-called material progress. The analogy is given that a lusty man, being agitated by sexual desire, sees the whole world as filled with sensuous women. In a similar way, a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness everywhere, although it may be temporarily covered. Thus one sees the world just as one sees himself (\u0101tmavan manyate jagat). On this basis one may argue that the vision of the mah\u0101-bhagavata is also illusioned, since the Bh\u0101gavatam has already stated throughout that those conditioned by the three modes of material nature are not at all K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious but in fact are inimical to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But although the conditioned living entity may appear inimical to the Lord, the eternal, unalterable fact is that every living being is part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although one\u2019s ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may now be covered by the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, by the causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the conditioned soul will gradually be promoted to the stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In fact, everyone is suffering the pangs of separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Because the conditioned soul imagines that he has no eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is unable to ascertain that all his miseries are due to this separation. This is m\u0101y\u0101, or \u201cthat which is not.\u201d Actually, to think that misery arises from anything other than separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to be in illusion. So when a pure devotee sees living entities suffering within this world, he correctly feels that just as he is suffering because of separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all other living beings are also suffering from separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The difference is that a pure devotee correctly ascertains the cause of his heartbreak whereas the conditioned soul, bewildered by m\u0101y\u0101, is unable to understand his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the unlimited pain arising from neglect of that relationship. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has quoted the following verses, which illustrate the ecstatic feelings of the topmost devotees of the Lord. In the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.35.9) the goddesses of Vraja speak as follows: \u201cThe creepers and trees of the forest, their branches weighed down by rich coverings of flowers and fruits, seemed to manifest Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u within their hearts. Exhibiting eruptions of ecstatic love upon their bodies, they poured down rains of honey.\u201d Elsewhere in the Tenth Canto (Bh\u0101g. 10.21.15) it is said: \u201cHearing the song of Lord Mukunda\u2019s flute, the rivers then stopped their currents, although the minds of the rivers could still be ascertained from the presence of whirlpools. With the arms of their waves the rivers seized the two lotus feet of Mur\u0101ri, taking help from the lotus plants, and thus He became trapped in their embrace.\u201d And in the last chapter of the Tenth Canto (10.90.15), the queens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 pray: \u201cDear kurar\u012b, now it is very late at night. Everyone is sleeping. The whole world is now calm and peaceful. At this time, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is sleeping, although His knowledge is undisturbed by any circumstance. Then why are you not sleeping? Why are you lamenting like this throughout the whole night? Dear friend, is it that you are also attracted by the lotus eyes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by His sweet smiling and attractive words, exactly as we are? Do those dealings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead pinch your heart as they do ours?\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has also given mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 as an example of an uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b, for mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 actually saw all living beings within the mouth of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a during the Lord\u2019s V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana l\u012bl\u0101. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also points out in his commentary, atra pa\u015byed iti tath\u0101 dar\u015bana-yogyataiva vivak\u1e63it\u0101, na tu tath\u0101 dar\u015banasya s\u0101rva-k\u0101likat\u0101. \u201cIn this verse the word pa\u015byet, or \u2018one must see,\u2019 does not mean that at every moment one is visualizing the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; rather, it means that one has reached the exalted platform of devotional service on which he is fit to see or is capable of seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form.\u201d If only those who constantly see the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are to be considered uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012bs, then N\u0101rada, Vy\u0101sa and \u015aukadeva cannot be considered topmost devotees, since they do not always see the Lord everywhere. Of course, N\u0101rada, Vy\u0101sa and \u015aukadeva are considered to be on the highest standard of pure devotional service, and therefore the real qualification is tad-did\u1e5bk\u1e63\u0101dhikya, or having an overwhelming desire to see the Lord. Therefore the statement of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that a devotee should see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere (yo m\u0101\u1e41 pa\u015byati sarvatra) can be understood in terms of the example of a lusty man\u2019s thinking that the world is full of beautiful women. Similarly, one should become transcendentally so desirous of seeing the Lord that one can perceive within the entire universe nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His potency. V\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti. In \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da\u2019s correspondence in 1969 with Professor J. F. Staal of the University of California, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da claimed that all of his disciples who were strictly following the intense program of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness were in fact sudurlabha-mah\u0101tm\u0101s who were seeing v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam. In other words, if one is constantly engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with an intense desire to please the Lord and one day gain His association, it is to be understood that in one\u2019s life there is nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has warned us, however, that a mere theoretical or academic understanding that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everything does not qualify one as a first-class devotee. One must actually have developed love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore it can be practically understood that anyone who enthusiastically adopts the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness program and eagerly participates in the preaching activities of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is acting on the platform of a madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b devotee. When such a devotee becomes overwhelmed by his desire to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and associate with the Lord, so much so that he is not attracted to anything else within the universe, he should be understood to be an uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, as mentioned in this verse."

        "translation": "An intermediate or second-class devotee, called madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b, offers his love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is a sincere friend to all the devotees of the Lord, shows mercy to ignorant people who are innocent and disregards those who are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, every living entity within the material world is eternally a minute fragmental portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25 (Bg. 15.7). But because of the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 the puffed-up conditioned souls become inimical to the service of the Lord and the Lord\u2019s devotees, choose leaders among the materialistic sense gratifiers, and thus engage busily in a useless society of the cheaters and the cheated, a society of the blind leading the blind into a ditch. Although the community of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas is sincerely eager to serve the conditioned souls by bringing them back to their constitutional position, by m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s influence the materialistic living entity becomes hardhearted and rejects the mercy of the Lord\u2019s devotees. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, although a second-class devotee is eager to preach to the innocent conditioned souls, he should avoid the atheistic class of men so that he will not become disturbed or polluted by their association. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has confirmed that a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should be indifferent to those who are envious of the Supreme Lord. It is practically seen that when such persons are informed of the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they attempt to ridicule the Supreme Lord, thus further deteriorating their polluted existence. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has quoted from the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.20.36): \u201cSometimes in autumn the water falls down from the tops of the hills to supply clean water, and sometimes the water stops. Similarly, sometimes great saintly persons distribute clear knowledge, and sometimes they are silent.\u201d In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has mentioned that although the first-class devotee of the Lord may at times exhibit apparent hatred toward the demons because of entering the mood of the Lord\u2019s pastimes, the intermediate devotees should avoid such feelings. Furthermore, the intermediate devotee should not in any way associate with the powerful atheistic class of men, because there is danger that his mind will become bewildered by such association. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, if a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava preacher encounters one who is envious of him, the preacher should remain far away from such an envious person. But the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava preacher may meditate upon ways to save the envious class of men. Such meditation is called sad-\u0101c\u0101ra, or saintly behavior. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has mentioned Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja as an example of a saintly person. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (7.9.43) there is the following statement by Prahl\u0101da: \u201cO best of the great personalities, I am not at all afraid of material existence, for wherever I stay I am fully absorbed in thought of Your glories and activities. My concern is only for the fools and rascals who are making elaborate plans for material happiness and maintaining their families, societies and countries. I am simply concerned with love for them.\u201d Although a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava preacher constantly meditates on the welfare of all living entities, he will not associate with those who are unreceptive to the message of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura states that even Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Vy\u0101sadeva and \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b do not exhibit their mercy indiscriminately. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has given an elaborate explanation to prove that the discrimination employed by a madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b preacher does not at all show a lack of mercy. He states that upek\u1e63\u0101, or neglect, as mentioned in this verse, is the proper medicine for those who are inimical to the Supreme Lord and His devotees. Indifference from the preacher checks feelings of hostility on both sides. Although there is a Vedic injunction that one should cut out the tongue of a person who offends the Supreme Lord and His devotees, in this age it is best simply to avoid potential offenders and thus prevent them from committing further sinful activities against the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. It is the duty of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava preacher to point out the futility of any process besides surrendering to the Supreme Lord. An envious person, however, will resent such strong preaching by a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and disrespect him, considering the devotee to be unnecessarily criticizing others. Such a person, who cannot appreciate the mercy of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, should be neglected. Otherwise, according to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, his cheating mentality will increase day by day. Those who are not attracted to the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and who disrespect the faithful servants of Lord Caitanya, considering their strong statements about the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement to be obstacles to their own worship of the Lord, will never be able to fix their minds on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but will gradually fall down from the path of devotion by confusing the external activities of the material world with the actual worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such bewilderment has been expressed by the words bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101t. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has strongly rejected those foolish persons who, under a plea of mercy and equal vision, perceive that a faithless person is also a devotee of the Supreme Lord and who thus try to thrust the hari-n\u0101ma, or holy name of God, upon such offensive people. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta has stated, \u201cWhen childish people think themselves mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavatas and act in defiance of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava spiritual master, such behavior simply holds them back from receiving the mercy of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava guru. Bewildered by false ego, these self-proclaimed devotees gradually become fit to be ignored by pure devotees on the intermediate platform and are cheated of the mercy that comes from the devotees\u2019 satisfaction. Thus they become as\u0101dhu by constantly committing offenses against the devotees who preach the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Pure devotees, therefore, in all circumstances display indifference to those who falsely imagine themselves to be vi\u015buddha-bhaktas, or pure devotees of the Lord. This indifference is an excellent manifestation of their mercy.\u201d In other words, those who criticize the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava preachers on the second-class platform for discriminating between those who are fit to receive the Lord\u2019s mercy and those who are simply envious are misunderstanding the mission of the Lord. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.8): \u201cTo deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear millennium after millennium.\u201d Even such a great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava as \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, one of the twelve mah\u0101janas in this universe, expressed his contempt for the evil Ka\u1e41sa. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has pointed out that even though the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata devotee may act on the second-class platform for preaching, his rejection of the envious living entities does not obstruct his vision of the Lord as all-pervading. Rather, when a first-class devotee or even a second-class devotee rejects the atheistic class of men, he is expressing the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A first-class or second-class Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava never actually becomes envious of another living entity, but out of intense love for the Supreme Lord he becomes angry when the Lord is offended. Also, understanding the Lord\u2019s mission, he discriminates according to the position of a particular living entity. To consider such a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava preacher an ordinary, envious person, or to consider him sectarian because of his proclamation of pure devotional service as the most exalted of all methods of spiritual advancement, reflects a materialistic vision called vai\u1e63\u1e47ave j\u0101ti-buddhi\u1e25 or guru\u1e63u nara-mati\u1e25. Such an offense drags the offender down to a hellish condition of life by the laws of nature. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, although a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata sees every living entity as a pure spirit soul, such a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata still experiences special ecstasies and other symptoms upon meeting another Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. This is not contradictory to his vision as a topmost devotee; rather, it is a symptom of his love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A pure devotee sees every living entity as part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and therefore expresses his love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through love for all the expansions and creations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Still, such a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata feels special ecstatic love upon seeing another living entity directly pleasing the senses of the Supreme Lord. Such feelings are manifest in the statement of Lord \u015aiva to the Pracet\u0101s: \u201cIf one by chance associates with a devotee, even for a fraction of a moment, he no longer is subject to attraction by the results of karma or j\u00f1\u0101na. What interest then can he have in the benedictions of the demigods, who are subject to the laws of birth and death?\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 4.24.57) Similarly, Lord \u015aiva also stated: \u201cYou are all devotees of the Lord, and as such I appreciate that you are as respectable as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. I know that in this way the devotees also respect me and that I am dear to them. Thus no one can be as dear to the devotees as I am.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 4.24.30) Similarly, in the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.7.11) \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b is mentioned as nitya\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47u-jana-priya\u1e25, especially dear to the pure devotees of the Lord. The wonderful loving dealings between Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas on the topmost platform are demonstrated in the pastimes of Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta. In other words, although a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sees every living entity as part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he must discriminate in his external behavior so as not to interfere with the original purpose of the Lord\u2019s creation, which is to reform the living entities so that they can gradually come back home, back to Godhead. A pure devotee does not foolishly pretend equal vision and approach envious persons; rather, he respects the mission of the Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.11) by the words ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham. On the other hand, if it is the Lord\u2019s desire, a pure devotee can offer his respects to all living beings. For example, \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b mentions that Uddhava and other pure devotees of the Lord were always prepared to offer respectful obeisances even to such persons as Duryodhana. Madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012bs, however, should not imitate such uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b behavior. In this connection, the distinction between madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b and uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b is stated by \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura as follows: atra sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u bhagavad-dar\u015bana-yogyat\u0101 yasya kad\u0101cid api na d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101. A madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b cannot at any time perceive the presence of the Supreme Lord within all living beings, whereas an uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b, however he acts on the second-class platform to carry out the Lord\u2019s mission, is aware that every living entity is ultimately a forgetful K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious living entity. Therefore, although a devotee may externally engage four different types of behavior, as mentioned in this verse \u2014 namely, worship of the Lord, friendship with the devotees, preaching to the innocent and rejection of the demons \u2014 he is not necessarily on the second-class platform, since an uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b also may exhibit these symptoms to carry out the Lord\u2019s mission. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura mentions that it is the duty of the madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b to extend himself as the right hand of the uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b, vowing to work for the benefit of others and offering to help in distributing love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Finally, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has given a nice explanation of the difference between arcana and bhajana. Arcana refers to the platform of s\u0101dhana-bhakti, in which one serves the Lord to carry out the rules and regulations of the process. One who has achieved the shelter of the Lord\u2019s holy name and is totally engaged in the attempt to serve the Lord should be considered to be on the platform of bhajana, even though his external activities may sometimes be less strict than those of the neophyte engaged in arcana. This apparent lack of strictness, however, refers to laxity not in the basic principles of sane behavior and renunciation of sense gratification, but rather in the details of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava ceremonies."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya comments that one in the lowest stage of devotional service faithfully worships the Deity in the temple but is not aware that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually all-pervading. This same mentality can be seen in the Western countries, where people commit all types of sinful activities in their homes and in the street but then piously go to a church and pray to God for mercy. Actually, God is in our home, God is in the street, God is in our office, God is in the forest, God is everywhere, and therefore God should be worshiped everywhere by the process of devotional service at His lotus feet. As stated in verse 41 of this chapter: \u201cA devotee should not see anything as being separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Ether, fire, air, water, earth, the sun and other luminaries, all living beings, the directions, trees and other plants, the rivers and oceans \u2014 whatever a devotee experiences he should consider to be an expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus seeing everything that exists within creation as the body of the Supreme Lord, Hari, the devotee should offer his sincere respects to the entire expansion of the Lord\u2019s body.\u201d This is the vision of the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata devotee of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya states that a madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b, a devotee in the intermediate stage, sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the cause of all causes and therefore offers his love to the Lord. Such a devotee is a sincere friend of other devotees, is merciful to the ignorant and avoids the atheists. Nonetheless, tad-va\u015batva\u1e41 na j\u0101n\u0101ti sarvasya jagato\u00a0\u2019pi tu: his realization of the all-pervading feature of the Supreme Lord is imperfect. Although he does have a general sense that everyone is ultimately meant to be a devotee of the Supreme Lord and he tries to use everything in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, aware that everything belongs to the Lord, he may be bewildered by association with atheistic men. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya states, arc\u0101y\u0101m eva sa\u1e41sthitam/ vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 tad-anyatra naiva j\u0101n\u0101ti ya\u1e25 pum\u0101n. A kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b has no idea that the Supreme Lord has the power to exist outside a church or temple. Furthermore, being puffed up by his own ceremonial worship (\u0101tmano bhakti-darpata\u1e25), a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b cannot imagine that anyone is more pious or religious than he, and he is not even aware that other devotees are more advanced. Thus he cannot understand the madhyama or uttama standard of devotional service, and sometimes, because of his false pride, he criticizes the more advanced devotees of the Lord, neglects them or simply has no understanding of their exalted position as preachers or completely self-realized souls. Another symptom of the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b is that he is infatuated by the material qualifications of so-called great materialistic persons. Having a bodily concept of life himself, he is attracted by material opulence and thus minimizes the position of the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Such a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b, therefore, is disturbed if a second-class devotee criticizes the nondevotees of the Lord. In the name of compassion or kindness, a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b approves of the nondevotional activities of such materialistic men. Because the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b is ignorant of the higher realms of devotional service and the unlimited transcendental bliss of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he sees devotional service merely as the religious aspect of life but thinks that life has many enjoyable and worthwhile nondevotional aspects. Therefore he becomes angry when second-class devotees, who are experiencing that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everything, criticize the nondevotees. Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says that such a person, because of his rudimentary faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is considered a devotee, but he is bhakt\u0101dhama, a devotee on the lowest standard. If such materialistic devotees follow the rules and regulations of Deity worship, they will gradually be elevated to a higher standard and eventually become pure devotees of the Lord, unless they commit offenses against other devotees, in which case their advancement will be checked. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya states, tad-bhakt\u0101n\u0101m upek\u1e63ak\u0101\u1e25 kuryur vi\u1e63\u1e47\u0101v api dve\u1e63am. Those who neglect or show indifference to the devotees of the Lord are to be considered offenders at the lotus feet of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Similarly, those who disrespect the demigods will become bereft of devotional service and be forced to rotate again and again within sa\u1e41s\u0101ra, the cycle of birth and death. P\u016bjy\u0101 dev\u0101s tata\u1e25 sad\u0101: the demigods are always to be offered respect, since they are devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If someone is envious of the demigods, he is to be considered envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, one who offers sincere respect to the demigods is considered to be respecting the will of the Supreme Lord. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava does not foolishly think that there are many gods. He knows that there is one Supreme Personality of Godhead. But as stated many times in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the Lord has a mission within this material world, which is to reform the conditioned living entities through the cruel laws of nature. In the Lord\u2019s mission within this world, the demigods are to be considered limbs of the Lord\u2019s body. It is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20): \u201cThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.\u201d But there are many examples of devotees who worshiped the demigods to get benedictions for serving Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The gop\u012bs worshiped the demigods to achieve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and similarly Rukmi\u1e47\u012bdev\u012b, on the day of her marriage, engaged in such demigod worship, her only goal being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even today the preachers of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement cultivate important people with all kindness and diplomacy so that such wealthy or influential people will engage their resources in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to glorify K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a all over the world. Similarly, offering all respects to the demigods so that they will give facility for the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not against the bhakti-m\u0101rga, although nowadays such demigod worship has also deteriorated. Therefore, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has recommended hari-n\u0101ma sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, chanting the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the only realistic process for this age. Nonetheless, a devotee of the Lord should not misinterpret Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101\u2019s injunctions against demigod worship as a license to offend the demigods, who are bona fide Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya notes, \u201cAll the demigods are extremely inimical to one who does not respect Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Such a person is pushed into the darkest regions by the Lord, as well as by the demigods.\u201d From this statement by \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, the devotional sentiments of the demigods can be understood. It is stated that in the supreme liberation achieved by an uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b, the most exalted devotee of the Lord, the devotee enjoys transcendental bliss in the direct association of the Supreme Lord and the demigods. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, since a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b who cannot properly respect other devotees will certainly fail to offer respects to ordinary living entities who are not even devotees, a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b is useless for practical preaching work unless he comes to a higher platform of understanding. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says, iya\u1e41 ca \u015braddh\u0101 na \u015b\u0101str\u0101rth\u0101vadh\u0101ra\u1e47a-j\u0101t\u0101. Because the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b\u2019s faith is not actually based on the statements of Vedic literature, he cannot understand the exalted position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within everyone\u2019s heart. Therefore he cannot actually manifest love of Godhead, nor can he understand the exalted position of the devotees of the Lord. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so glorious that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s intimate associates must also be glorious. But this is unknown to a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b. Similarly, the essential qualification of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, which is to offer all respects to others (am\u0101nin\u0101 m\u0101nadena k\u012brtan\u012bya\u1e25 sad\u0101 hari\u1e25), is also conspicuous by its absence in a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b. If such a person, however, has faith in the Vedic literatures and tries to understand the statements of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, he will gradually be elevated to the second- and first-class stages of devotional service. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b should very seriously engage in regulated worship of the Deity. The Deity is a particular incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can present Himself before the worshiper in five different manifestations, namely His original form as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (para), His quadruple expansions (vy\u016bha), His pastime incarnations (vaibhava), the Supersoul (antary\u0101m\u012b) and the Deity (arc\u0101). Within the Deity form (arc\u0101) is the Supersoul, who in turn is included within the Lord\u2019s pastime forms (vaibhava). The Supreme Lord\u2019s vaibhava-prak\u0101\u015ba is an emanation from the catur-vy\u016bha. This quadruple expansion of the Lord is situated within the supreme truth, V\u0101sudeva, who Himself is situated within the svaya\u1e41-prak\u0101\u015ba-tattva. This svaya\u1e41-prak\u0101\u015ba consists of expansions of the ultimate svaya\u1e41-r\u016bpa-tattva, the original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in the spiritual sky. This hierarchy of the expansions of the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world is realized even within the material world in terms of one\u2019s eagerness to render service to the Lord. A beginner in the lowest stage of devotional service should try to dedicate all his activities to the satisfaction of the Lord and cultivate the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the temple. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, all the plenary expansions of the Supreme Lord mentioned above descend into this world and enter within the Deity, who exhibits the function of the Supersoul by accompanying the daily life of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Although the vaibhava, or pastime expansions, of the Lord incarnate at specific times (r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan), the Supersoul and Deity forms are constantly available for the spiritual advancement of the devotees in this world. As one comes to the madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b platform, one is able to understand the expansions of the Supreme Lord, whereas the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b\u2019s entire knowledge of the Lord is limited to the Deity. Nonetheless, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that to encourage even the lowest class of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas He condenses all of His various forms into the Deity so that by worshiping the Deity the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b devotee is worshiping all the forms of the Lord. As the devotee makes advancement, he can understand these forms as they appear in their own way, both within this world and in the spiritual sky. As long as one remains on the third-class platform, one has no transcendental appreciation of the blissful reality of the Supreme Lord\u2019s paraphernalia and entourage. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was very pleased with King Prat\u0101parudra when the King, upon receiving an outer cloth from the Lord, immediately installed it as a Deity and began to worship it as being as good as the Lord Himself. Lord \u015aiva himself has stated, tasm\u0101d paratara\u1e41 devi tad\u012by\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 samarcanam. Worship of the paraphernalia, entourage or devotees of the Lord is even better than worship of the Lord, because the Lord is more pleased by worship of His devotees and entourage than by worship of Himself personally. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the inability of the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b to appreciate the Lord\u2019s devotees, entourage and paraphernalia indicates that such a materialistic Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is still affected by the speculative understanding of the karma-v\u0101d\u012bs and M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, those who are dedicated to sense gratification and impersonal speculation about the Absolute. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da often said that only the impersonalist desires to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a alone; we desire to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with His cows, His friends, His parents, His gop\u012bs, His flute, jewelry, forest scenery and so on. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is gorgeous in the setting of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. It is in the land of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, surrounded by so many beautiful associates, manifests His exalted indescribable beauty. Similarly, the unique mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is exhibited in the activities of His pure devotees who selflessly travel around the universe distributing the dust particles from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet on the heads of the conditioned souls. One who is uninterested in the Lord\u2019s paraphernalia, entourage and devotees has a stunted conception of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This must be due to contamination from the impersonal and sensuous understandings of life. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura states that after hundreds of lifetimes of faithfully worshiping the Deity of Lord V\u0101sudeva with external paraphernalia, one realizes the true nature of His transcendental name and mantras, and the bondage of one\u2019s materialistic mentality slackens. In this way, as a kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b gradually comes to perceive the mental activities of a devotee and tries seriously to advance to a higher stage, his materialistic conceptions will go away of their own accord. He then exhibits loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and makes friendship with the devotees who are the dearmost sons of the Lord, and by appreciating the universal quality of devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he becomes very much eager to engage other innocent people in the service of the Lord. Further, as he begins to make significant advancement he becomes inimical to anything or anyone that hinders the progress of his devotional life, and thus he avoids atheistic people who cannot benefit by good instruction. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, founded by His Divine Grace O\u1e41 Vi\u1e63\u1e47up\u0101da Paramaha\u1e41sa Parivr\u0101jak\u0101c\u0101rya 108 \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bmad Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da, is so nice that anyone who helps this society immediately engages in preaching work for the Lord. Thus there is great facility for the members of this society to come quickly to the second-class stage of devotional service. If in the name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one gives up preaching and instead becomes interested simply in collecting funds for maintenance, he is showing a type of envy of other living entities. This is a symptom of the third-class platform. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, verses 45 through 47 constitute the answer to King Nimi\u2019s two questions \u201cWhat is the nature of devotional service to the Lord?\u201d and \u201cWhat are the specific duties of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas?\u201d"

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the position of the uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b, or first-class devotee of the Lord, is so worshipable that additional symptoms are now given in eight verses. It should be understood that unless one comes in contact with the lotus feet of a pure devotee of the Lord, the path of freedom from material illusion is very difficult to understand. In the fifth verse of \u015ar\u012b Upade\u015b\u0101m\u1e5bta \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated, \u015bu\u015br\u016b\u1e63ay\u0101 bhajana-vij\u00f1am ananyam anya-nind\u0101di-\u015b\u016bnya-h\u1e5bdam \u012bpsita-sa\u1e45ga-labdhy\u0101: \u201cOne should associate with and faithfully serve that pure devotee who is advanced in undeviated devotional service and whose heart is completely devoid of the propensity to criticize others.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da comments, \u201cIn this verse \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b advises the devotee to be intelligent enough to distinguish between the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b, madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b and uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b. A neophyte Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava or a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava situated on the intermediate platform can also accept disciples, but such disciples must be on the same platform, and it should be understood that they cannot advance very well toward the ultimate goal of life under his insufficient guidance. Therefore a disciple should be careful to accept an uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b as a spiritual master.\u201d Therefore additional symptoms will now be given so that the conditioned soul who desires to go back home, back to Godhead, can properly identify the bona fide spiritual master. According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b and \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, associating with a pure devotee of the Lord is so important that now that the various categories of devotional service have been defined, eight additional verses are given concerning the qualifications of a pure devotee, so that students of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam will make no mistake in this connection. Similarly, in the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Arjuna asked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a about the symptoms of a completely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a elaborately explained the symptoms of one who is praj\u00f1\u0101 prati\u1e63\u1e6dhit\u0101, or established in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The particular qualification mentioned in this verse is vi\u1e63\u1e47or m\u0101y\u0101m ida\u1e41 pa\u015byan: one should see the entire material universe as a product of the illusory energy of the Lord. There is no question of lamenting or rejoicing for that which is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Within this world one generally laments upon losing something desirable and rejoices upon acquiring the object of his wish. But since a pure devotee has no personal desire whatsoever (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-bhakta ni\u1e63k\u0101ma \u2014 ataeva\u00a0\u2018\u015b\u0101nta\u2019), there is no question of gain or loss. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): \u201cOne who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\u201d Similarly, Lord \u015aiva says to his wife, P\u0101rvat\u012b, while glorifying the character of King Citraketu, \u201cDevotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, never fear any condition of life. For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 6.17.28) This state of complete satisfaction in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not a mental concoction achieved by artificial meditation, but is a result of having experienced the superior nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is a reservoir of transcendental bliss. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.59), rasa-varja\u1e41 raso\u00a0\u2019py asya para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate. When impersonalists and voidists artificially try to push material things out of their minds, they undergo great hardships and ordeals in their artificial meditation. According to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is only with great inconvenience and suffering that one can achieve impersonal liberation, because every living being is eternally a person, being part and parcel of the Supreme Person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The concept of giving up one\u2019s personal identity is a reaction to the terrible frustration of material egotism. It is not a positive program. If one is suffering unbearable pain in his hand, he may agree to have the hand amputated, but the real solution is to remove the infection so that the healthy hand may become a source of pleasure. Similarly ego, or the sense that \u201cI am,\u201d is a source of unlimited happiness when we understand what we are, namely servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Impersonal meditation is dry and troublesome. A pure devotee realizes that he is an eternal person, part and parcel of the Supreme Person, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that he has the privilege as the son of God to participate in the ecstatic eternal pastimes of the Supreme Lord, loving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and playing with Him forever. For such a devotee the pale material nature, which is but a perverted reflection of the spiritual world, becomes totally unattractive. Therefore, one who is completely attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and uninterested in the manifestations of m\u0101y\u0101 can be considered bh\u0101gavatottama\u1e25, a pure devotee of the Lord, as described in a previous verse (bhakti\u1e25 pare\u015b\u0101nubhavo viraktir anyatra ca). \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has stated, vi\u1e63\u1e47or m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47v-icch\u0101dh\u012bn\u0101m: \u201cThe words vi\u1e63\u1e47or m\u0101y\u0101m in this verse indicate that the illusory energy always remains dependent upon the will of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\u201d Similarly the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.44) says, s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di-sthiti-pralaya-s\u0101dhana-\u015baktir ek\u0101 ch\u0101yeva yasya bhuvan\u0101ni bibharti durg\u0101. M\u0101y\u0101 is like a shadow of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who serves Him in the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this world. Just as a shadow has no independent power of movement but follows the substance that casts the shadow, the illusory energy of the Lord has no independent power, but bewilders the living entities according to the Lord\u2019s desire. One of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s opulences is that He is supremely detached; when a living entity wants to forget Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately employs His illusory energy to facilitate the foolishness of the conditioned soul. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b the words g\u1e5bh\u012btv\u0101p\u012bndriyair arth\u0101n indicate that the pure devotee of the Lord does not cease acting within this world; rather, he uses his senses in the service of the Lord of the senses, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has stated that if one gives up those material things which are favorable for serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, considering them material and therefore an impediment to his spiritual advancement, his renunciation is merely phalgu-vair\u0101gya, or immature and imperfect renunciation. On the other hand, one who accepts all material things for the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without any personal desire for sense gratification is actually renounced (yukta\u1e41 vair\u0101gyam ucyate). \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has warned in his commentary on this verse that by envying any of the three classes of devotees \u2014 uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b, madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b or kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b \u2014 one falls down to the platform of impersonalism and loses all power to benefit others or even himself. Therefore those who are trying to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should not endanger their transcendental experience by unnecessarily criticizing other Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, if one engages in phalgu-vair\u0101gya, or renouncing material things that are favorable to the service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one runs the risk of being polluted by impersonal philosophy. On the other hand, by sticking to the principle of yukta-vair\u0101gya, engaging everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without personal desire, one can remain aloof from the danger of material sense gratification and gradually come to the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata platform, as mentioned in this verse."

        "translation": "Within the material world, one\u2019s material body is always subject to birth and decay. Similarly, the life air [pr\u0101\u1e47a] is harassed by hunger and thirst, the mind is always anxious, the intelligence hankers for that which cannot be obtained, and all of the senses are ultimately exhausted by constant struggle in the material nature. A person who is not bewildered by the inevitable miseries of material existence, and who remains aloof from them simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is to be considered bh\u0101gavata-pradh\u0101na, the foremost devotee of the Lord.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya there are three classes of intelligent living beings within this world, namely the demigods, ordinary human beings, and demons. A living being endowed with all auspicious qualities \u2014 in other words, a highly advanced devotee of the Lord \u2014 either on the earth or in the higher planetary systems is called a deva, or demigod. Ordinary human beings generally have good and bad qualities, and according to this mixture they enjoy and suffer on the earth. But those who are distinguished by their absence of good qualities and who are always inimical to pious life and the devotional service of the Lord are called asuras, or demons. Of these three classes, the ordinary human beings and demons are terribly afflicted by birth, death and hunger, whereas the godly persons, the demigods, are aloof from such bodily distress. The demigods remain aloof from such distress because they are enjoying the results of their pious activities; by the laws of karma, they are unaware of the gross suffering of the material world. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.20): \u201cThose who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly planets, worship Me indirectly. They take birth on the planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights.\u201d But the next verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 says that when one uses up the results of these pious activities, one has to forfeit his status as a demigod, along with the pleasure of the heavenly kingdom, and return to earth as a nara, or ordinary human being (k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti). In fact the laws of nature are so subtle that one may not even return to earth as a human, but may take birth as an insect or tree, depending on the particular configuration of his karma. The pure devotee of the Lord, however, does not experience material misery, because he has given up the bodily concept of life and identifies himself correctly as an eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.2), susukha\u1e41 kartum avyayam. Even in the stage of regulative practice, the process of bhakti-yoga is very joyful. Similarly, Locana d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, a near contemporary of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, said, saba avat\u0101ra s\u0101ra \u015biroma\u1e47i kevala \u0101nanda-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. Although there are various k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0das, or divisions, of Vedic discipline, such as karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (fruitive ceremonies) and j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (regulated speculation), Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s hari-n\u0101ma sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement is kevala \u0101nanda-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, the pathway of pure bliss. Simply by chanting the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, eating the remnants of sumptuous food offered to the Supreme Lord and hearing the enchanting pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, one merges into an ocean of bliss called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Fortunately this blissful ocean is the eternal situation of every living entity, provided he gives up all of his bogus concepts of life. One should not identify himself as a gross material body, nor as a fickle mind, nor as speculative intelligence, nor should one foolishly identify himself with the so-called void of Buddhist imagination. Nor should one even identify himself with the ocean of impersonal spiritual life called the brahmajyoti, which illuminates the great outdoors of the spiritual sky beyond the covered universe. One should rather identify himself correctly as an eternal individual servant of the supreme individual Personality of Godhead. By this simple admission of one\u2019s constitutional position and by sincere engagement in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, one is quickly promoted to direct participation in the eternal pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as Arjuna got the opportunity to play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a soldier on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has given an elaborate description of the process by which material miseries arise. When a conditioned soul of demoniac mentality identifies himself with the gross material body, he undergoes miseries of constant drowsiness and unquenchable sexual desires that burn all mental peace and serenity to ashes. When a demoniac person identifies himself with pr\u0101\u1e47a, the life air, he suffers from hunger, and by identifying himself with the mind he suffers panic, fear, and hankering that ends in disappointment. When he identifies himself with intelligence, he suffers profound existential bitterness and frustration deep within his heart. When he identifies himself with the false ego, he feels inferiority, thinking, \u201cI am so low.\u201d And when he identifies himself with the process of consciousness, he is haunted by memories of the past. When a demon tries to impose himself as the ruler of all living beings, all of these miseries expand simultaneously. According to \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, sinful life is the demoniac standard for happiness. We can observe that in demoniac societies the dark, late hours of night are considered most appropriate for recreational activity. When a demon hears that someone is rising at four o\u2019clock in the morning to take advantage of the godly early-morning hours, he is astonished and bewildered. Therefore it is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.69): \u201cWhat is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has commented, \u201cThere are two classes of intelligent men. The one is intelligent in material activities for sense gratification, and the other is introspective and awake to the cultivation of self-realization.\u201d Thus the more one can increase illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling, the more one advances his prestige in a demoniac society, whereas in a godly society based on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness these things are abolished completely. Similarly, as one becomes blissfully attached to the holy name and pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one becomes more and more alienated from the demoniac society. The demons are self-proclaimed enemies of the Supreme Lord, and they mock His kingdom. Thus they are described by \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya as adho-gate\u1e25, or those who have purchased their tickets to the darkest regions of hell. On the other hand, if one is undisturbed by the miseries of material life, he is on the same spiritual level as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.15): \u201cO best among men [Arjuna], the person who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation.\u201d One can come to this transcendental stage only by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the words of \u015ar\u012b Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, samp\u016br\u1e47\u0101nugrah\u0101d vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has described the process by which one becomes an uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b. If one is fortunate, he gradually becomes disgusted with the limited vision and activities of the kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b and learns to appreciate the expanded vision of the madhyama-adhik\u0101r\u012b, who is able to recognize that every living entity should become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that one achieves the perfection of life by following in the footsteps of an uttama-adhik\u0101r\u012b devotee of the Lord. As one\u2019s devotional service gradually intensifies and one repeatedly bathes in dust from the lotus feet of a pure devotee, the harassment of birth, death, hunger, thirst, fear and so on gradually cease disturbing the mind. As stated in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.114): \u201cEven if a devotee is frustrated in his attempt to eat properly or clothe himself properly, he should not allow this material failure to disturb his mind; rather, he should use his intelligence to remember his master, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus remain undisturbed.\u201d As one becomes mature in this process of remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in all circumstances, he is awarded the title mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta gives the example that just as a child\u2019s ball may be fastened to the end of a rope so that it cannot bounce away, a devotee who surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes tied to the rope of Vedic injunctions and is never lost in worldly affairs. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has quoted from the \u1e5ag Veda (1.156.3) as follows: om \u0101sya j\u0101nanto n\u0101ma cid vivaktan mahas te vi\u1e63\u1e47o su-mati\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mahe o\u1e41 tat sat. \u201cO Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Your name is completely transcendental. Thus it is self-manifest. Indeed, even without properly understanding the glories of chanting Your holy name, if we vibrate Your name with at least a small understanding of its glories \u2014 that is, if we simply repeat the syllables of Your holy name \u2014 gradually we shall understand it.\u201d The supreme entity indicated by the pra\u1e47ava om is sat, or self-revealing. Therefore, even if one is disturbed by fear or envy, the transcendental form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will become manifest to one who continues to chant the Lord\u2019s holy name. Further evidence is given in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (6.2.14): \u201cOne who chants the holy name of the Lord is immediately freed from the reactions of unlimited sins, even if he chants indirectly (to indicate something else), jokingly, for musical entertainment, or even neglectfully. This is accepted by all the learned scholars of the scriptures.\u201d"

In fact, one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord is freed from even the desire to enjoy material sense gratification. Plans for enjoying sex life, social prestige and money cannot develop within his mind. Thus he is considered bh\u0101gavatottama, a pure devotee of the Lord on the highest platform.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, this verse describes the behavior of a devotee of the Lord. The activities of a pure devotee are devoid of material envy, false elation, delusion and lust. According to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava commentators, the word b\u012bj\u0101n\u0101m in this verse refers to v\u0101san\u0101\u1e25, or deeply rooted desires, which gradually fructify in the form of activities, for which the living entity becomes subject to reactions. Thus the compound word k\u0101ma-karma-b\u012bj\u0101n\u0101m indicates the deep-rooted desire to lord it over the material world through the enjoyment of sexual pleasure and the expansions of sexual pleasure mentioned in the Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.8) as g\u1e5bha-k\u1e63etra-sut\u0101pta-vittai\u1e25, that is, a beautiful residential building and ample land for producing sumptuous food to fill the belly, as well as children, friends, social contacts and a large bank balance. All of these material items are essential for completely forgetting that one is an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Therefore as stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam, janasya moho\u00a0\u2019yam aha\u1e41 mameti: intoxicated by these objects of material illusion, the conditioned soul becomes madly convinced that he is the center of the universe and that everything in existence has been created only for his personal sense gratification. Whoever obstructs such illusory enjoyment becomes immediately his enemy and subject to be killed. Because of this bodily concept of life and the shackles of illusion, the whole world is being violently shaken by conflict arising from envy and lust. The only possible solution is to accept the leadership of the Lord\u2019s pure devotees, who are described here. A popular expression used to justify democratic government is \u201cPower corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d Such homilies may be valid on the material platform, but it is specifically mentioned here that a pure devotee of the Lord who has completely taken shelter of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet cannot even consider taking part in material envy and sense gratification. His mind remains perpetually clear and sober, and he is always aware of the ultimate good of every living entity. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is strenuously endeavoring to inform the earth\u2019s suffering living entities of the serious need for a brain in human society. A brain racked by fever cannot give proper direction, and if the so-called thinkers of society are burning with selfish desires, they are no better than feverish, delirious brains. Delirious governments are gradually destroying all traces of happiness in human society. Therefore it is the duty of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava preachers to act on the platform of bh\u0101gavatottama so that they can give clear guidance to humanity, without being corrupted or even slightly attracted by the material opulence that may be offered to a saintly person. All intelligent human beings who are unable to take directly to the process of bhakti-yoga should at least be sufficiently educated to recognize the first-class devotee of the Lord and accept his guidance. In this way human society can be very nicely organized so that not only all human beings but even the animals, birds and trees can make advancement in life and gradually go back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has emphasized that those seriously interested in achieving the perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness must live in a community of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has also mentioned several times in his literature that it is not possible to achieve the stage of perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness unless one accepts the shelter of the pure devotees by living in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious communities being established all over the world by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has emphasized that this does not mean that spiritual life is restricted only to those celibate students who can live within a temple compound. Devotees in the g\u1e5bhastha order, that of spiritual family life, can also take shelter of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava community by regularly attending temple functions. Those who are living in family life should daily see the Deity of the Supreme Lord, chant His holy names in His personal presence, accept the remnants of food offered to the Deity and hear learned discourses on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Any householder who regularly takes advantage of these spiritual facilities and follows the regulative principles of spiritual life, namely no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication, is to be considered a bona fide member of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava community. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, those who remain inimical to the devotional service of the Lord are to be considered lifeless puppets in the hands of the illusory energy of the Lord."

        "translation": "Birth in an aristocratic family and the execution of austere and pious activities certainly cause one to take pride in himself. Similarly, if one enjoys a prestigious position within society because his parents are highly respected members of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama social system, one becomes even more infatuated with himself. But if despite these excellent material qualifications one does not feel even a tinge of pride within himself, he is to be considered the dearmost servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the word janma (\u201cgood birth\u201d) refers to such classes as the m\u016brdh\u0101vasiktas (children of br\u0101hma\u1e47a fathers and k\u1e63atriya mothers) and amba\u1e63\u1e6dhas (children of br\u0101hma\u1e47a fathers and vai\u015bya mothers), both of which are considered anuloma since the father comes from a higher caste. Marriages in which the mother comes from a higher class than the father are called pratiloma. In any case, one who becomes proud of his so-called prestigious birth is certainly in the bodily concept of life. Birth in any material body is a serious problem, which one should solve by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can thereby release himself from the golden shackles of a so-called aristocratic material body. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012bs think that karma-mi\u015bra bhakti, or devotional service mixed with material endeavor, is the ultimate in spiritual life. They become attached to verses such as this: \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is worshiped by the proper execution of prescribed duties in the system of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama. There is no other way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One must be situated in the institution of the four var\u1e47as and \u0101\u015bramas.\u201d (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 3.8.9) Thus they think that material work in which a portion of the fruits are offered to God forms the highest platform of human life. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, there are several sm\u1e5bti literatures that have encouraged such mixed devotional service. Such books are taken by materialistic devotees as facility for offending the holy name of the Lord because of egotistic attachment to the material body. Thus one thinks that a prestigious position in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system according to birth and so-called pious activities is a prerequisite for becoming successful in life. But those who have actually taken shelter of the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never boast about their birth in the material world, nor do they pride themselves on their so-called expertise in material work. As long as one\u2019s mentality is encumbered by the material designations of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, one has very little chance of becoming free from material bondage and establishing himself as dear to the Lord. In this regard, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu emphatically declared that He could not identify Himself with any var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama designation, such as that of a great intellectual or priest, a courageous warrior in the Lord\u2019s army, a brilliant businessman making money for the Lord, or the hardest worker for the Lord. Nor could Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu identify Himself as a stalwart brahmac\u0101r\u012b, a noble householder or an exalted sanny\u0101s\u012b. These designations reflect the material pride that can infiltrate the execution of devotional service. Although a devotee may carry out the standard duties of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama, his only designation is gop\u012b-bhartu\u1e25 pada-kamalayor d\u0101sa-d\u0101s\u0101nud\u0101sa\u1e25, the eternal servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord, the master of the gop\u012bs, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, when a devotee understands that the process of bhakti-yoga is complete in itself and he becomes absorbed in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, the supremely merciful Personality of Godhead affectionately lifts such a first-class devotee onto His own lap. The Supreme Lord can be pleased only by unalloyed devotion, and not by any arrangement of the gross body, composed of five material elements, or the subtle body, composed of innumerable speculations and bogus pride. In other words, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can never be pleased by one\u2019s so-called aristocratic body, which is due to be devoured by worms or vultures. If one becomes proud of his material birth and so-called pious activities, by such false pride one gradually develops the impersonal mentality of merely renouncing the fruit of work or else the karm\u012b mentality of enjoying the fruits of work. Neither the karm\u012bs nor the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b speculators are aware that the fruit of work actually belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The conclusion is that one should carefully give up all false pride and always remember that he is a humble servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, am\u0101nin\u0101 m\u0101nadena k\u012brtan\u012bya\u1e25 sad\u0101 hari\u1e25."

        "translation": "When a devotee gives up the selfish conception by which one thinks \u201cThis is my property, and that is his,\u201d and when he is no longer concerned with the pleasures of his own material body or indifferent to the discomforts of others, he becomes fully peaceful and satisfied. He considers himself simply one among all the living beings who are equally part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a satisfied Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is considered to be at the highest standard of devotional service.",
        "purport": " The vision described by the phrase sarva-bh\u016bta-sama\u1e25, \u201cseeing all living entities equally,\u201d does not include one\u2019s vision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted from the Har\u012b-va\u1e41\u015ba as follows: \u201cUnder no circumstance should one consider the living entity equal to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, either in conditional life or in liberation.\u201d The impersonal speculative philosophers are fond of imagining that although in our present illusion we appear to be individual entities, at liberation we shall all merge into God and be God. Such wishful thinkers cannot reasonably explain how the omnipotent God could arrive at the embarrassing position of having to enter a yoga studio, pay weekly fees, press His nose and chant mantras to regain His divinity. As stated in the Vedas, nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m eko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101n. The individuality or plurality of living entities is not a product of material existence. The word nity\u0101n\u0101m, denoting the plurality of eternal entities, clearly indicates that the living entities are eternally individual parts and parcels of the Lord, who is the singular unique entity described here as eka\u1e25. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (1.21) Arjuna said to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, ratha\u1e41 sth\u0101paya me\u00a0\u2019cyuta: \u201cMy dear Acyuta, please place my chariot between the armies.\u201d This body is also ratha, a vehicle, and therefore the best policy is to request the infallible Lord to take charge of our conditioned body and guide us on the path back to the kingdom of God. The word acyuta means \u201cthe infallible\u201d or \u201cone who never falls.\u201d Learned or sane human beings will not entertain the silly notion that the omnipotent, omniscient God has slipped and fallen because of m\u0101y\u0101. No amount of wishful thinking can erase our eternal servitorship at the lotus feet of the Lord. This fact is stated by the Lord Himself in the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cYou should never think Me one of the ordinary living entities in the j\u012bva category. In fact I am the reservoir of all opulences and godly qualities, and therefore you should understand that I am the Supreme Lord.\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam does not forbid using a particular object in the Lord\u2019s service, since a devotee is free to use anything favorable for serving Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This acceptance of favorable objects in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called yukta-vair\u0101gya. As stated by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, nirbandha\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sambandhe: one should be attached for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sake, never for one\u2019s own sake. If one interprets this verse to indicate that one should not exercise control over any material object, even if it is favorable for serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one falls into the bad understanding called phalgu-vair\u0101gya, or immature renunciation. Great kings such as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it engaged the entire earth, and other Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas have engaged the entire universe in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But they completely gave up the sense of their personal proprietorship. That is the point made in this verse. Just as one becomes very much concerned about any pain in one\u2019s own body, one should be concerned with bringing the conditioned souls to the platform of devotional service so that all of their suffering will be banished forever. That is the actual purport of not distinguishing between one body and another."

A pure devotee of the Lord can never forget those lotus feet in any circumstance. He will not give up his shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord for a single moment \u2014 indeed, not for half a moment \u2014 even in exchange for the benediction of ruling and enjoying the opulence of the entire universe. Such a devotee of the Lord is to be considered the best of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b one may ask, \u201cIf one were able to gain the opulence of the entire universe in exchange for leaving the Lord\u2019s lotus feet for just half a moment, what would be the harm in leaving the Lord\u2019s lotus feet for such an insignificant amount of time?\u201d The answer is given by the word aku\u1e47\u1e6dha-sm\u1e5bti. It is simply impossible for a pure devotee to forget the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, since everything that exists is in fact an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Since nothing is separate from the Supreme Lord, a pure devotee of the Lord cannot think of anything but the Lord. Nor can a pure devotee contemplate ruling or enjoying universal opulence; even if given all the opulence of the universe, he would immediately offer it at the lotus feet of the Lord and return to his position of a humble servant of the Lord. The words ajit\u0101tma-sur\u0101dibhir vim\u1e5bgy\u0101t are very significant in this verse. The lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are so opulent that even the lords of all material opulence, namely Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, as well as the other demigods, are always searching for a glimpse of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. The word vim\u1e5bgy\u0101t indicates that the demigods are not actually able to see the lotus feet of the Lord, but are endeavoring to see them. An example of this is given in the Tenth Canto when Lord Brahm\u0101 offers prayers to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, begging the Lord to rectify the disturbances on the earth. A similar verse is found elsewhere in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.14.14): \u201cThe devotee who has offered his soul to Me does not want anything if it is separate from Me \u2014 not the position of the supreme demigod of the universe, Brahm\u0101, nor that of Lord Indra, nor kingship over the entire earth or over the lower planetary systems, nor the mystic perfections of yoga, nor even freedom from the cycle of rebirth.\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the word ajit\u0101tm\u0101 can also be taken to mean ajitendriy\u0101\u1e25, or \u201cthose whose senses are uncontrolled.\u201d Although the demigods are all to be respected as devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the absence of gross material discomfort in the higher planetary systems makes them tend to become affected by the bodily concept of life, and sometimes they experience some spiritual difficulty due to the gorgeous material facilities available to them. Such disturbances, however, cannot exist within the mind of a pure devotee of the Lord, as indicated in this verse by the word aku\u1e47\u1e6dha-sm\u1e5bti. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, we can understand from this verse that since none of the material facilities available in any of the universal planetary systems can distract a pure devotee of the Lord, such a devotee can never possibly fall or become inimical to the Lord\u2019s service."

        "translation": "How can the fire of material suffering continue to burn the hearts of those who worship the Supreme Lord? The Lord\u2019s lotus feet have performed innumerable heroic deeds, and the beautiful nails on His toes resemble valuable jewels. The effulgence emanating from those nails resembles cooling moonshine, for it instantly relieves the suffering within the heart of the pure devotee, just as the appearance of the moon\u2019s cooling light relieves the burning heat of the sun.",
        "purport": " When the moon rises, the expansion of its rays drives away the distress of the sun\u2019s fierce heat. Similarly, the cooling rays emanating from the lotus nails of the Personality of Godhead\u2019s lotus feet vanquish all distress for the Lord\u2019s pure devotee. According to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava commentators it is to be understood from this verse that material lust, exemplified by uncontrolled sexual desire, is exactly like a blazing fire. The flames of this fire burn to ashes the peace and happiness of the conditioned soul, who perpetually wanders in 8,400,000 species of life, vainly struggling to extinguish this intolerable fire. The pure devotees of the Lord place the Lord\u2019s cooling, jewellike lotus feet within their hearts, and thus all of the pain and suffering of material existence are extinguished. The word uru-vikram\u0101\u1e45ghri indicates that the Lord\u2019s lotus feet are quite heroic. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is famous for His incarnation as V\u0101mana, the dwarf br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who extended His beautiful toes up to the outer limits of the universe and perforated the universal shell, thus bringing the waters of the holy Ganges into the universe. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was entering the city of Mathur\u0101 to challenge the demoniac King Ka\u1e41sa and His entrance was impeded by a ferocious elephant named Kuvalay\u0101p\u012b\u1e0da, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a kicked the elephant to death and peacefully entered the city gates. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet are so exalted that the Vedic literatures state that the entire material manifestation rests beneath His lotus feet: sam\u0101\u015brit\u0101 ye pada-pallava-plava\u1e41 mahat pada\u1e41 pu\u1e47ya-ya\u015bo mur\u0101re\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.58)."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is so kind to the conditioned souls that if they call upon Him by speaking His holy name, even unintentionally or unwillingly, the Lord is inclined to destroy innumerable sinful reactions in their hearts. Therefore, when a devotee who has taken shelter of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet chants the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with genuine love, the Supreme Personality of Godhead can never give up the heart of such a devotee. One who has thus captured the Supreme Lord within his heart is to be known as bh\u0101gavata-pradh\u0101na, the most exalted devotee of the Lord.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the essence of a pure devotee\u2019s qualifications is given in this verse. A pure devotee is one who has attracted the Lord by his love so that the Lord cannot give up the devotee\u2019s heart. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the word s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t in this verse indicates that a pure devotee has realized knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, having given his heart to the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is all-attractive in six opulences, including beauty. A pure devotee can never be attracted by the fleshy bags of women\u2019s breasts or by the hallucinations of so-called society, friendship and love within the material world. Therefore his clean heart becomes a suitable abode for the Supreme Lord. A gentleman will live only in a clean place. He will not live in a polluted, contaminated place. Educated people in the Western countries are now greatly protesting the pollution of water and air by urban industrial enterprises. People are demanding the right to live in a clean place. Similarly, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme gentleman, and therefore He will not live in a polluted heart, nor will He appear within the polluted mind of a conditioned soul. When a devotee surrenders to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and becomes a lover of the Lord by direct realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s all-attractive nature, the Lord makes His residence in the clean heart and mind of such a pure devotee. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, ya et\u0101d\u1e5b\u015ba-pra\u1e47ayav\u0101\u1e41s ten\u0101nena tu sarvad\u0101 param\u0101va\u015benaiva k\u012brtyam\u0101na\u1e25 sutar\u0101m evam ev\u0101ghaugha-n\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sy\u0101t. If a devotee is absorbed in the loving transcendental service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, directly or indirectly he is always glorifying the Lord by transcendental loving service. Therefore, even if he chants the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with improper attention due to being absorbed in the Lord\u2019s service, the mercy of the Lord purifies his heart of all sinful reactions. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.1.11): \u201cO King, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord after the ways of the great authorities is the doubtless and fearless way of success for all, including those who are free from all material desires, those who are desirous of all material enjoyment, and also those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge.\u201d Therefore if one who has not come to the platform of loving devotional service chants the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will also be gradually freed from all sinful reactions. In the Sixth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, in the purports to the history of Aj\u0101mila, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has elaborately explained the holy name\u2019s potency to purify even an ordinary person. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has nicely explained the process of bringing the Supreme Lord under control. Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 bound the child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to a grinding mortar with a rope. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being attracted by the inconceivable love of His devotees, allowed Himself to be bound. Therefore, although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a binds all the conditioned souls by the chains of His illusory potency, m\u0101y\u0101, if those same conditioned souls become pure devotees of the Lord they can in turn bind K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by the chains of love of God. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, all the world\u2019s inauspicious conditions due to sinful activities can be immediately eradicated by the chanting of the Lord\u2019s holy name. The Supreme Personality of Godhead never leaves the hearts of those who give up all sinful behavior and chant His holy name. Even if such chanting is not yet perfect, devotees who always remain in the Lord\u2019s service will gradually come to the stage of prema-ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101, or steady love of Godhead. Then they are to be considered mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavatas, or pure devotees of the Lord."
