Through the perfection of pr\u0101pti one acquires whatever one desires, and through pr\u0101k\u0101mya-siddhi one experiences any enjoyable object, either in this world or the next. Through \u012b\u015bit\u0101-siddhi one can manipulate the subpotencies of m\u0101y\u0101, and through the controlling potency called va\u015bit\u0101-siddhi one is unimpeded by the three modes of nature. One who has acquired k\u0101m\u0101vas\u0101yit\u0101-siddhi can obtain anything from anywhere, to the highest possible limit. My dear gentle Uddhava, these eight mystic perfections are considered to be naturally existing and unexcelled within this world.",
        "purport": " Through a\u1e47im\u0101-siddhi one can become so small that one can enter a stone or pass through any obstacle. Through mahim\u0101-siddhi one becomes so great that one covers everything, and through laghim\u0101 one becomes so light that one can ride on the sun\u2019s rays into the sun planet. Through pr\u0101pti-siddhi one can acquire anything from anywhere and can even touch the moon with one\u2019s finger. By this mystic perfection one can also enter into the senses of any other living entity through the predominating deities of the particular senses; and by thus utilizing the senses of others, one can acquire anything. Through pr\u0101k\u0101mya one can experience any enjoyable object, either in this world or the next, and through \u012b\u015bit\u0101, or the controlling potency, one can manipulate the subpotencies of m\u0101y\u0101, which are material. In other words, even by acquiring mystic powers one cannot pass beyond the control of illusion; however, one may manipulate the subpotencies of illusion. Through va\u015bit\u0101, or the power to control, one can bring others under one\u2019s dominion or keep oneself beyond the control of the three modes of nature. Ultimately, one acquires through k\u0101m\u0101vas\u0101yit\u0101 the maximum powers of control, acquisition and enjoyment. The word autpattik\u0101\u1e25 in this verse indicates being original, natural and unexcelled. These eight mystic potencies originally exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the superlative degree. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes so small that He enters within the atomic particles, and He becomes so large that as Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u He breathes out millions of universes. The Lord can become so light or subtle that even great mystic yog\u012bs cannot perceive Him, and the Lord\u2019s acquisitive power is perfect, because He keeps the total existence eternally within His body. The Lord certainly can enjoy whatever He likes, control all energies, dominate all other persons and exhibit complete omnipotency. Therefore it is to be understood that these eight mystic perfections are insignificant expansions of the mystic potency of the Lord, who in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is called Yoge\u015bvara, the Supreme Lord of all mystic potencies. These eight perfections are not artificial, but are natural and unexcelled because they originally exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " By taking birth as a demigod one is automatically endowed with many mystic perfections. Simply by birth on Siddhaloka one automatically acquires all of the eight principal perfections of yoga. Similarly, by birth as a fish one becomes invulnerable to water, by birth as a bird one gets the mystic perfection of flying, and by birth as a ghost one gets the mystic perfection of disappearing and entering into the bodies of others. Pata\u00f1jali Muni states that the mystic perfections of yoga can be achieved by birth, herbs, austerities and mantras. The Lord states, however, that such perfections are ultimately a waste of time and an impediment to achieving the actual perfection of yoga, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who give up the process of bhakti-yoga and shop around for other objects of meditation besides K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are certainly not very intelligent. Those who claim to be yog\u012bs but pursue the satisfaction of their own senses are certainly kuyog\u012bs, or bhogi-yog\u012bs. Such kuyog\u012bs cannot understand that just as they have tiny senses, the Absolute Truth has absolute senses, nor can they understand that yoga is actually meant to satisfy the absolute senses of the Lord. Therefore, persons who give up the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in order to pursue so-called happiness in mystic perfection will undoubtedly be frustrated in their attempt. By meditating exclusively on the Supreme Personality of Godhead one can achieve yoga-gati, the ultimate goal of yoga, which means living on Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s planet and there enjoying spiritual opulences."
