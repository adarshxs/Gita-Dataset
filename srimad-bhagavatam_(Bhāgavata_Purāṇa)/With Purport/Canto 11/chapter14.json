Not all Vedic processes lead directly to the ultimate goal, pure love of God; some only gradually elevate the consciousness of the living entity.

In discussing the relative advantages of different spiritual processes, one must immediately ascertain the goal of spiritual life and then isolate the process that actually awards this goal. Processes must be defined in terms of primary and secondary functions. A method that gives one the highest perfection is primary, whereas processes that merely assist or enhance the primary function are considered secondary. The mind is most flickering and unsteady; therefore by clear intelligence one must fix oneself in a progressive mode of life, and thus one can achieve the Absolute Truth in this lifetime. This is the sober purpose of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s conversation with \u015ar\u012b Uddhava."

One who has not developed his attraction to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot restrain the senses from inferior engagements. Since other Vedic processes do not actually award Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to the practitioner, they cannot offer the highest benefit in life. The transcendental sound of the Vedas is itself the highest evidence, but one whose senses and mind are entangled in sense gratification and mental speculation, and whose heart is therefore covered by material dust, cannot directly receive the transcendental Vedic message. Thus one cannot appreciate the exalted position of devotional service to the Lord."

Devotional service to the Lord, however, is a pure spiritual process, and by executing it with a pure consciousness one comes directly in touch with the Personality of Godhead, who describes Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.2) as pavitram idam uttamam, the supreme pure. The system of parampar\u0101, or disciplic succession, is illustrated in this and the previous verse.

All of the many universal species, along with their respective leaders, appeared with different natures and desires generated from the three modes of material nature. Therefore, because of the different characteristics of the living entities within the universe, there are a great many Vedic rituals, mantras and rewards.",
        "purport": " If one is curious why Vedic literatures recommend so many different methods of worship and advancement, the answer is given here. Bh\u1e5bgu, Mar\u012bci, Atri, A\u1e45gir\u0101, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu are the seven great br\u0101hma\u1e47a sages and forefathers of this universe. The Kindevas are a race of human beings who are, like the demigods, completely free from fatigue, sweat and body odor. Seeing them, one may thus ask, ki\u1e41 dev\u0101\u1e25: \u201cAre they demigods?\u201d Actually, they are human beings living on another planet within the universe. The Kinnaras are so called because they are ki\u00f1cin nar\u0101\u1e25, or \u201ca little like human beings.\u201d The Kinnaras have either a human head or human body (but not both) combined with a nonhuman form. The Kimpuru\u1e63as are so called because they resemble human beings and thus prompt the question ki\u1e41 puru\u1e63\u0101\u1e25: \u201cAre these human beings?\u201d Actually, they are a race of monkeys who are almost like human beings. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that this verse describes the varieties of forgetfulness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The different Vedic mantras and rituals are especially meant for the different species of intelligent beings throughout the universe; but this proliferation of Vedic formulas indicates only the variety of material illusion and not a variety of ultimate purpose. The ultimate purpose of the many Vedic injunctions is one \u2014 to know and love the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord Himself is emphatically explaining this to \u015ar\u012b Uddhava."

Similarly, the Lord gives preference to a helpless devotee who depends completely on His mercy. The only way to obtain the Lord\u2019s mercy is through His causeless love, and the Lord is most lovingly inclined toward those devotees who are most dependent on Him, just as ordinary mothers and fathers worry more about their helpless children than about those who are self-sufficient. Thus even if one lacks any material qualification, one should simply depend upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without any other interest, and surely one will achieve the highest perfection of life."

But even though one\u2019s senses are not fully conquered, one who has unflinching devotion for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not run the risk of being separated from Him. The words pragalbhay\u0101 bhakty\u0101 indicate a person who has great devotion for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and not one who desires to commit sinful activities and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to avoid the reaction. Because of previous bad habits and immaturity, even a sincere devotee may be harassed by lingering attraction to the bodily concept of life; but his unflinching devotion for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will act. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura gives the following two examples. A great warrior may be struck by the weapon of his enemy, but because of his courage and strength he is not killed or defeated. He accepts the blow and goes on to victory. Similarly, one may contract a serious disease, but if he takes the proper medicine he is quickly cured. If those who follow the impersonal system of speculation and austerity deviate even slightly from their path, they fall down. A devotee, however, even though immature, never falls from the path of devotional service. Even if he displays occasional weakness, he is still considered a devotee if his devotion to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very strong. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.30): \u201cEven if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.\u201d"

As stated in the previous verse, a sincere loving devotee, because of immaturity or previous bad habits, may be disturbed by his senses even though he has accepted Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the only goal in his life. But if even by chance the devotee accidentally falls down without premeditation or indifference, the Lord immediately burns to ashes his sinful reactions, just as a blazing fire immediately consumes an insignificant piece of wood. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is glorious, and one who takes exclusive shelter of the Lord receives the unique benefits of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

If one does not cry in spiritual happiness, how can one render loving service to the Lord? And without such service, how can the consciousness be purified?",
        "purport": " Loving service to the Lord is the only process that can completely purify one\u2019s consciousness; such service produces waves of ecstatic love that completely cleanse the soul. As mentioned earlier by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to \u015ar\u012b Uddhava, other processes such as self-control, pious activities, mystic yoga, penances, etc., certainly purify the mind, as stated in many authorized literatures. Such processes, however, do not completely remove the desire to perform forbidden activities. But pure devotional service rendered in love of Godhead is so powerful that it burns to ashes any obstacle encountered on the path of progress. The Lord has stated in this chapter that loving service to Him is a blazing fire that burns to ashes all impediments. In contrast, the small fires of mental speculation or mystic yoga can be extinguished by sinful desires at any moment. Thus, by hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam one should ignite the blazing fire of loving service to the Lord and burn to ashes the network of material illusion."

Therefore it may be asked why Uddhava is again referring to the system of meditation, dhy\u0101na. The \u0101c\u0101ryas explain that one cannot fully appreciate the beauty and perfection of bhakti-yoga unless one sees its superiority to all other processes. Through comparative analysis, the devotees become fully ecstatic in their appreciation of bhakti-yoga. It should also be understood that although Uddhava asks about those who aspire for liberation, he is not actually a mumuk\u1e63u, or salvationist; rather, he is asking questions for the benefit of those who are not on the platform of love of Godhead. Uddhava wants to hear this knowledge for his personal appreciation and so that those who pursue salvation, or liberation, can be protected and redirected to the path of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord."

This lotus has eight petals and is situated on an erect lotus stalk. One should meditate on the sun, moon and fire, placing them one after the other within the whorl of that lotus flower. Placing My transcendental form within the fire, one should meditate upon it as the auspicious goal of all meditation. That form is perfectly proportioned, gentle and cheerful. It possesses four beautiful long arms, a charming, beautiful neck, a handsome forehead, a pure smile and glowing, shark-shaped earrings suspended from two identical ears. That spiritual form is the color of a dark rain cloud and is garbed in golden-yellowish silk. The chest of that form is the abode of \u015ar\u012bvatsa and the goddess of fortune, and that form is also decorated with a conchshell, disc, club, lotus flower and garland of forest flowers. The two brilliant lotus feet are decorated with ankle bells and bracelets, and that form exhibits the Kaustubha gem along with an effulgent crown. The upper hips are beautified by a golden belt, and the arms are decorated with valuable bracelets. All of the limbs of that beautiful form capture the heart, and the face is beautified by merciful glancing. Pulling the senses back from the sense objects, one should be grave and self-controlled and should use the intelligence to strongly fix the mind upon all of the limbs of My transcendental body. Thus one should meditate upon that most delicate transcendental form of Mine.",

Every living entity is originally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and when that forgotten eternal relationship is revived one experiences remembrance of the Absolute Truth. In that stage, described here as mad-\u0101roha\u1e25, one no longer sees oneself as a meditator nor the Lord as a mere object of meditation, but rather one enters the spiritual sky for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in direct loving relationship with the Lord. Uddhava originally inquired about the procedure of meditation for those desiring liberation. The word labdha-padam indicates that when one fixes the mind upon the Lord\u2019s face, one achieves full liberation. In the postliberation phase one then proceeds to render service to the original Personality of Godhead. By giving up the concept of being a meditator, one casts off the last small remnant of illusory energy and sees the Lord as He actually is."

        "purport": " Because of false material identification, we accept our own body and mind, the bodies and minds of others, and supernatural material control to be ultimate realities. Supernatural control refers to the bodies and minds of the demigods, who ultimately are humble servitors of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the mighty sun, which displays immense potencies, obediently treads its universal path by the order of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is clearly seen in this chapter that ha\u1e6dha-yoga, karma-yoga, r\u0101ja-yoga, etc., are part and parcel of bhakti-yoga and do not actually exist separately. The goal of life is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one must eventually come to the stage of pure devotion if one desires to perfect one\u2019s meditation or yoga practice. In the mature stage of devotion, as described in this chapter, one becomes free from the artificial duality of meditator and object of meditation, and one spontaneously engages in hearing about and glorifying the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such activities of bhakti-yoga are natural because they spring from spontaneous love. When one revives one\u2019s original nature as the loving servitor of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, other yoga processes cease to be interesting. Uddhava was a pure devotee even before the Lord began His instruction; therefore it was not expected that Uddhava would give up the supreme platform of being a personal associate of the Lord to take up the mechanical exercises of the yoga system. Bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, is so elevated that even in the beginning stages of practice one is considered liberated, because all of one\u2019s activities are executed under proper guidance for the pleasure of the Lord. In the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system one is concerned with bodily control, and in j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga one is concerned with speculative knowledge. In both systems one endeavors selfishly, desiring to become a great yog\u012b or a philosopher. Such egoistic activity is described in this verse as kriy\u0101. One must give up the illusory designations of dravya, j\u00f1\u0101na and kriy\u0101 and come to the prideless stage of loving service to the Lord."
