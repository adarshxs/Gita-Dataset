        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Uddhava, due to the influence of the material modes of nature, which are under My control, the living entity is sometimes designated as conditioned and sometimes as liberated. In fact, however, the soul is never really bound up or liberated, and since I am the Supreme Lord of m\u0101y\u0101, which is the cause of the modes of nature, I also am never to be considered liberated or in bondage.",
        "purport": " In this chapter the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, explains the different characteristics of conditioned and liberated life, the symptoms by which one can recognize saintly persons, and the various processes of devotional service to the Lord. In the previous chapter, Uddhava inquired from the Lord how conditioned and liberated life are possible. The Lord now replies that Uddhava\u2019s question is somewhat superficial, since the pure spirit soul is never entangled in the material energy of the Lord. The living entity imagines a false connection with the three modes of nature and accepts the material body as the self. The living entity therefore suffers the consequences of his own imagination, just as one suffers the illusory activities of a dream. This does not indicate that the material world is illusory in the sense that it is nonexistent. The material world is certainly real, being the potency of the Personality of Godhead, and the living entity, being the superior potency of God, is also real. But the living entity\u2019s dream of being part and parcel of the material world is an illusion that drags him into the contradictory state called material conditioned life. The living entity is never actually baddha, or bound up, since he merely imagines a false connection with the material world. Because there is ultimately no permanent connection between the living entity and matter, there is no actual liberation. The living entity, being eternally transcendental to the inferior material energy of the Lord, is eternally liberated. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reveals that in one sense the living entity is factually not bound up and thus cannot be liberated. But in another sense, the terms bondage and liberation can be conveniently applied to indicate the particular situation of the individual soul, who is the marginal potency of the Lord. Although the individual soul is never actually bound to matter, he suffers the reactions of material nature because of false identification, and thus the term baddha, or \u201cbound up,\u201d may be used to indicate the nature of a living entity\u2019s experience within the inferior energy of the Lord. Since baddha describes a false situation, freedom from such a false situation may also be described as mok\u1e63a, or liberation. Therefore the terms bondage and liberation are acceptable if one understands that such terms only refer to temporary situations created by illusion and do not refer to the ultimate nature of the living entity. In this verse Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states, gu\u1e47asya m\u0101y\u0101-m\u016blatv\u0101n na me mok\u1e63o na bandhanam: the terms liberation and bondage can never be applied to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, since He is the Absolute Truth and the supreme controller of everything. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is eternally the supreme transcendental entity, and He can never be bound by illusion. It is the duty of the illusory potency of the Personality of Godhead to attract the living entities to ignorance by creating the false impression of a blissful existence separate from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The illusory conception of existence apart from the Personality of Godhead is called m\u0101y\u0101, or material illusion. Since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme absolute controller of m\u0101y\u0101, there is no possibility that m\u0101y\u0101 could have any influence over the Personality of Godhead. Thus the term bandhanam, or \u201cbondage,\u201d cannot be applied to the eternal, blissful and omniscient Personality of Godhead. The term mok\u1e63a, or \u201cliberation,\u201d indicating freedom from bandhana, is equally irrelevant to the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has commented on this verse as follows. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with great spiritual potencies. Because of mundane concoction, the conditioned soul imagines that the Absolute Truth is devoid of variegated spiritual potencies by which He may enjoy blissful life. Although the living entity is the spiritual potency of the Lord, he is presently situated in the inferior, illusory potency, and by engaging in mental speculation he becomes bound in conditioned life. Liberation means that the living entity should transfer himself to the spiritual potency of the Lord, which can be divided into three categories \u2014 hl\u0101din\u012b, the potency of bliss; sandhin\u012b, the potency of eternal existence; and sa\u1e41vit, the potency of omniscience. Since the Personality of Godhead is eternally endowed with a pure existence of bliss and knowledge, He is never conditioned or liberated. The living entity, however, being entangled in the Lord\u2019s material potency, is sometimes conditioned and sometimes liberated. The neutral, original state of the three modes of nature is called m\u0101y\u0101. When the three modes of nature interact, one of them will become powerful, subordinating the other two modes until another mode becomes prominent. In this way, the three can be distinguished in their variety of manifestation. Although the threefold material potency expands from the Personality of Godhead, the Lord Himself in His personal form is the actual abode of the three spiritual potencies, namely eternality, bliss and knowledge. If one desires to become free from the entanglement of conditioned life within the material sky, called the kingdom of m\u0101y\u0101, one must come to the spiritual sky, wherein the living entities are filled with bliss, possess eternal spiritual bodies and engage in the loving devotional service of the Lord. By developing one\u2019s eternal, spiritual form in the loving service of the Lord, one immediately transcends the duality of conditioned life and impersonal liberation and can directly experience the spiritual potencies of the Lord. At that time there is no possibility of false identification with the material world. Realizing oneself to be eternal spirit soul, the living entity can understand that he is never truly connected to matter, because he is part of the superior energy of the Lord. Therefore, both material bondage and liberation are ultimately meaningless within the reality of the spiritual sky. The living entity is the marginal potency of the Lord and should exercise his free will to engage in the pure devotional service of the Lord. By reviving one\u2019s eternal, spiritual body one can understand oneself to be a minute particle of the spiritual potency of the Lord. In other words, the living entity is a minute particle of eternity, bliss and omniscience, and thus in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness there is no possibility of his being carried away by the illusion of the three modes of nature. In conclusion, it may be stated that the individual living entity is never actually entangled in matter and is thus not liberated, although his illusory state may be accurately described as entangled and liberated. On the other hand, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally situated in His own spiritual potencies and can never be described as being bound up, and thus there is no meaning to the concept of the Lord\u2019s freeing Himself from such a nonexistent condition."

        "translation": "Just as a dream is merely a creation of one\u2019s intelligence but has no actual substance, similarly, material lamentation, illusion, happiness, distress and the acceptance of the material body under the influence of m\u0101y\u0101 are all creations of My illusory energy. In other words, material existence has no essential reality.",
        "purport": " The word deha-\u0101patti\u1e25 indicates that the living entity falsely identifies himself with the external material body and thus transmigrates from one body to another. \u0100patti also indicates great suffering or misfortune. Because of such false identification under the influence of illusion, the living entity experiences the miserable symptoms described here. M\u0101y\u0101 means the false concept that anything can exist without Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or for any purpose other than the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Although the conditioned living entities are trying to enjoy material sense gratification, the result is always painful, and such painful experiences turn the conditioned soul back toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, the ultimate purpose of the material creation is to bring the living entity back to the loving devotional service of the Lord. Therefore, even the sufferings of the material world may be seen as the transcendental mercy of the Personality of Godhead. The conditioned soul, imagining that material objects are meant for his personal enjoyment, bitterly laments the loss of such objects. In this verse, the example is given of a dream in which the material intelligence creates many illusory objects. Similarly, our polluted material consciousness creates the false impression of material sense gratification, but this phantasmagoria, being devoid of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, has no real existence. By surrendering to polluted material consciousness, the living entity is afflicted with innumerable troubles. The only solution is to see Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within everything and everything within Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus, one understands that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme enjoyer, the proprietor of everything and the well-wishing friend of all living beings. In material illusion there is no understanding of one\u2019s eternal, spiritual body, nor is there knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, material existence, even in its most sophisticated or pious form, is always foolishness. One should not misunderstand the example of the dream to mean that the material world has no real existence. Material nature is the manifestation of the Lord\u2019s external potency, just as the spiritual sky is the manifestation of the Lord\u2019s internal potency. Although material objects are subject to transformation and thus have no permanent existence, the material energy is real because it comes from the supreme reality, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is only our false acceptance of the material body as the factual self and our foolish dream that the material world is meant for our pleasure that have no real existence. They are merely mental concoctions. One should cleanse oneself of material designations and wake up to the all-pervading reality of the Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "translation": "O Uddhava, both knowledge and ignorance, being products of m\u0101y\u0101, are expansions of My potency. Both knowledge and ignorance are beginningless and perpetually award liberation and bondage to embodied living beings.",
        "purport": " By the expansion of vidy\u0101, or knowledge, a conditioned soul is liberated from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, and similarly, by the expansion of avidy\u0101, or ignorance, the conditioned soul is driven further into illusion and bondage. Both knowledge and ignorance are products of the mighty potency of the Personality of Godhead. The living being is bound by illusion when he considers himself the proprietor of the subtle and gross material bodies. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b the living entity may be designated as j\u012bva-m\u0101y\u0101, whereas matter is called gu\u1e47a-m\u0101y\u0101. The living entity places his living potency (j\u012bva-m\u0101y\u0101) in the grip of the mundane qualitative potency (gu\u1e47a-m\u0101y\u0101) and falsely dreams that he is part and parcel of the material world. Such an artificial mixture is called illusion or ignorance. When all of the Lord\u2019s potencies are correctly perceived in their proper categories, the living entity is liberated from material bondage and returns to his blissful eternal residence in the spiritual sky. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not different from His potencies, yet He is always above them as the supreme controller. The Supreme Personality of Godhead may be designated as mukta, or liberated, only to indicate that He is eternally free from material contamination and never to indicate that the Lord has been freed from actual entanglement in a material situation. According to \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, vidy\u0101 indicates the goddess of fortune, the internal potency of the Lord, whereas avidy\u0101 indicates Durg\u0101, the external potency of the Lord. Ultimately, however, the Personality of Godhead can transform His potencies according to His own desire, as explained by \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da in his commentary on \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.3.34), \u201cBecause the Lord is the absolute Transcendence, all of His forms, names, pastimes, attributes, associates and energies are identical with Him. His transcendental energy acts according to His omnipotency. The same energy acts as His external, internal and marginal energies, and by His omnipotency He can perform anything and everything through the agency of any of the above energies. He can turn the external energy into internal by His will.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b notes in this regard that although the Lord has explained in the first verse of this chapter that the living entity is never actually in bondage, and therefore never actually liberated, one may apply the terms bondage and liberation if one remembers that the living entity is eternally a transcendental fragment of the Personality of Godhead. Further, one should not misinterpret the words m\u0101yay\u0101 me vinirmite to indicate that both material bondage and liberation are temporary states, being creations of the potency of the Lord. Therefore, the term \u0101dye, or \u201cprimeval and eternal,\u201d is used in this verse. The vidy\u0101 and avidy\u0101 potencies of the Lord are stated to be creations of m\u0101y\u0101 because they carry out the functions of the Lord\u2019s potencies. The vidy\u0101 potency engages the living entities in the Lord\u2019s pastimes, whereas the avidy\u0101 potency engages the living entities in forgetting the Lord and merging into darkness. Actually, both knowledge and ignorance are eternal alternatives of the marginal potency of the Lord, and in this sense it is not incorrect to state that the living entity is either eternally conditioned or eternally liberated. The term vinirmite, or \u201cproduced,\u201d in this case indicates that the Lord expands His own energy as knowledge and ignorance, which display the functions of the Lord\u2019s internal and external potencies. Such potential exhibitions may appear and disappear in different times, places and circumstances, but material bondage and spiritual freedom are eternal options of the marginal potency of the Lord."

As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.5): \u201cBesides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, consisting of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da states in connection with this verse: \u201cThe Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power.\u201d Because of quantitative inferiority of potency, the living entity becomes covered by m\u0101y\u0101 and is again liberated by surrendering to the Lord. The word a\u1e41\u015ba, or \u201cpart and parcel,\u201d is also mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7): mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25. The living entity is a\u1e41\u015ba, or a minute particle, and therefore subject to liberation and bondage. As stated in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, possesses His superior internal potency as well as the potency called k\u1e63etraj\u00f1\u0101 \u015bakti. This k\u1e63etraj\u00f1\u0101 \u015bakti is also spiritual potency, but it is sometimes covered by the third, or material, potency called ignorance. Thus because of the various stages of covering, the second, or marginal, potency is manifested in different evolutionary phases.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has written that the living entity has been executing fruitive activities since time immemorial. Thus his conditioned life may be called beginningless. Such conditioned life, however, is not endless, since the living entity may achieve liberation through the loving devotional service of the Lord. Since the living entity may acquire liberation, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura states that his liberated life begins at a certain point but is endless, because liberated life is understood to be eternal. In any case, one who has achieved the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, may be understood to be eternally liberated, since such a person has entered into the eternal atmosphere of the spiritual sky. Since there is no material time in the spiritual sky, one who has achieved his eternal spiritual body on Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s planet is not subject to the influence of time. His eternal blissful life with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not designated in terms of material past, present and future and is therefore called eternal liberation. Material time is conspicuous by its absence in the spiritual sky, and every living entity there is eternally liberated, having attained the supreme situation. Such liberation can be achieved by vidy\u0101, or perfect knowledge, which is understood in three phases called Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n, as described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The ultimate phase of vidy\u0101, or knowledge, is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 such knowledge is called r\u0101ja-vidy\u0101, or the king of all knowledge, and it awards the supreme liberation."

        "translation": "By chance, two birds have made a nest together in the same tree. The two birds are friends and are of a similar nature. One of them, however, is eating the fruits of the tree, whereas the other, who does not eat the fruits, is in a superior position due to His potency.",
        "purport": " The example of two birds in the same tree is given to illustrate the presence within the heart of the material body of both the individual soul and the Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead. Just as a bird makes a nest in a tree, the living entity sits within the heart. The example is appropriate because the bird is always distinct from the tree. Similarly, both the individual soul and the Supersoul are distinct entities, separate from the temporary material body. The word balena indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by His own internal potency, which consists of eternality, omniscience and bliss. As indicated by the word bh\u016by\u0101n, or \u201chaving superior existence,\u201d the Supreme Lord is always in a superior position, whereas the living entity is sometimes in illusion and sometimes enlightened. The word balena indicates that the Lord is never in darkness or ignorance, but is always full in His perfect, blissful consciousness. Thus, the Lord is niranna, or uninterested in the bitter fruits of material activities, whereas the ordinary conditioned soul busily consumes such bitter fruits, thinking them to be sweet. Ultimately, the fruit of all material endeavor is death, but the living entity foolishly thinks material things will bring him pleasure. The word sakh\u0101yau, or \u201ctwo friends,\u201d is also significant. Our real friend is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is situated within our heart. Only He knows our actual needs, and only He can give us real happiness. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that He patiently sits in the heart, trying to guide the conditioned soul back home, back to Godhead. Certainly no material friend would remain with his foolish companion for millions of years, especially if his companion were to ignore him or even curse him. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is such a faithful, loving friend that He accompanies even the most demoniac living entity and is also in the heart of the insect, pig and dog. That is because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is supremely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and sees every living entity as part and parcel of Himself. Every living being should give up the bitter fruits of the tree of material existence. One should turn one\u2019s face to the Lord within the heart and revive one\u2019s eternal loving relationship with one\u2019s real friend, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The word sad\u1e5b\u015bau, or \u201cof similar nature,\u201d indicates that both the living entity and the Personality of Godhead are conscious entities. As part and parcel of the Lord we share the Lord\u2019s nature, but in infinitesimal quantity. Thus the Lord and the living entity are sad\u1e5b\u015bau. A similar statement is found in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (4.6): \u201cThere are two birds in one tree. One of them is eating the fruits of the tree, while the other is witnessing the actions. The witness is the Lord, and the fruit-eater is the living entity.\u201d"

        "translation": "The bird who does not eat the fruits of the tree is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who by His omniscience perfectly understands His own position and that of the conditioned living entity, represented by the eating bird. That living entity, on the other hand, does not understand himself or the Lord. He is covered by ignorance and is thus called eternally conditioned, whereas the Personality of Godhead, being full of perfect knowledge, is eternally liberated.",
        "purport": " The word vidy\u0101-maya in this verse indicates the internal potency of the Lord and not the external potency, mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101. Within the material world there is vidy\u0101, or material science, and avidy\u0101, or material ignorance, but in this verse vidy\u0101 means the internal spiritual knowledge by which the Personality of Godhead is fixed in omniscience. The example of two birds in a tree, which is given in many Vedic literatures, demonstrates the statement nityo nity\u0101n\u0101m: there are two categories of eternal living entities, namely the Supreme Lord and the minute j\u012bva soul. The conditioned j\u012bva soul, forgetting his identity as an eternal servant of the Lord, tries to enjoy the fruits of his own activities and thus comes under the spell of ignorance. This bondage of ignorance has existed since time immemorial and can be rectified only by one\u2019s taking to the loving devotional service of the Lord, which is full of spiritual knowledge. In conditioned life the living entity is forced by the laws of nature to engage in pious and impious fruitive activities, but the liberated position of every living entity is to offer the fruits of his work to the Lord, the supreme enjoyer. It should be understood that even when the living entity is in a liberated condition, his knowledge is never equal in quantity to that of the Personality of Godhead. Even Lord Brahm\u0101, the supreme living entity within this universe, acquires only partial knowledge of the Personality of Godhead and His potencies. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.5), the Lord explains His superior knowledge to Arjuna: \u201cThe Blessed Lord said: Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy!\u201d The term baddha, or \u201cbound,\u201d is also understood to refer to the living entity\u2019s eternal dependence upon the Lord, either in the conditioned or liberated state. In the kingdom of m\u0101y\u0101 the living entity is bound to the cruel laws of birth and death, whereas in the spiritual sky the living entity is fixed in a bond of love to the Lord. Liberation means freedom from the miseries of life, but never freedom from one\u2019s loving relationship with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is the essence of one\u2019s eternal existence. According to \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, the Lord is the only eternally free living entity, and all other living entities are eternally dependent and bound to the Lord, either through blissful loving service or through the bondage of m\u0101y\u0101. The conditioned soul should give up tasting the bitter fruits of the tree of material existence and turn to his dearmost friend, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is sitting within his heart. There is no pleasure equal to or greater than the pleasure of pure devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and by tasting the fruit of love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the liberated living entity enters the ocean of happiness."

Similarly, one who has awakened to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness no longer identifies with the gross or subtle material bodies, nor does he become affected by the happiness and distress of material life. On the other hand, a foolish person (kumati) does not awaken from the dream of material existence and is afflicted with innumerable problems due to false identification with the gross and subtle material bodies. One should become situated in one\u2019s eternal spiritual identity (nitya-svar\u016bpa). By properly identifying oneself as the eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one becomes relieved of his false material identity, and therefore the miseries of illusory existence immediately cease, just as the anxiety of a troublesome dream ceases as soon as one awakens to his normal, pleasant surroundings. It should be understood, however, that the analogy of awakening from a dream can never be applied to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never in illusion. The Lord is eternally awake and enlightened in His own unique category called vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva. Such knowledge is easily understood by one who is vidv\u0101n, or enlightened in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a makes a similar statement in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.28): \u201cOne who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth, O mighty-armed, does not engage himself in the senses and sense gratification, knowing well the difference between work in devotion and work for fruitive results.\u201d The material body always interacts with the sense objects, for in order to survive the body must eat, drink, speak, sleep, and so on, but an enlightened person who knows the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness never thinks, \u201cI am accepting these sense objects as my property. They are meant for my pleasure.\u201d Similarly, if the body performs a wonderful activity, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not become proud, nor is he depressed by the failure of the body to function in a particular way. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means giving up identification with the gross and subtle material bodies. One should see them as the external energy of the Lord, working under the direction of the Lord\u2019s empowered representative m\u0101y\u0101. One absorbed in fruitive activities works under the jurisdiction of mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, or the external illusory potency, and experiences the miseries of material existence. On the other hand, a devotee works under the internal potency, called yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, and remains satisfied by offering his loving service to the Lord. In either case, the Lord Himself, by His multifarious potencies, is the ultimate performer of action. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, one who claims to be transcendental to the bodily concept of life, but at the same time remains under the influence of material desire and mental transformation, is understood to be a cheater and the lowest type of conditioned soul."

While engaged in bodily functions, an unintelligent person is attached to both the means and end of material life and therefore experiences intense lamentation and jubilation on the material platform. A self-realized soul, however, studies the inevitable defeat and suffering of ordinary persons and does not make the mistake of trying to enjoy the bodily functions even slightly. He instead remains a detached witness, merely engaging his senses in the normal functions of bodily maintenance.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and there is no possibility of any existence separate from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such expert knowledge cuts all doubts to pieces.

By awakening to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one completely retires from illusory sense gratification and becomes absorbed in the progressive realization of the soul situated within the body. As revealed in the example of the two birds in a tree, both the individual soul and the Personality of Godhead are completely separate from the gross and subtle material bodies. If one turns one\u2019s face to the Lord, recognizing one\u2019s eternal dependence on Him, there will be no further suffering or anxiety, even though one is still situated within the material world. The unlimited experiences of material objects only increase one\u2019s anxiety, whereas perception of the Absolute Truth, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, immediately brings one to the platform of peace.

An impersonal interpretation in this case would be eka-de\u015b\u0101nvaya uttara-\u015blok\u0101rtha-t\u0101tparya-virodha\u1e25, or a contradictory interpretation that creates illogical conflict with other \u015blokas (verses) spoken in the same context. It requires great endeavor to take care of a cow. One must either grow food grains to feed the cow or maintain suitable pastures. If the pasture is not properly maintained, poisonous weeds will grow, or snakes will multiply, and there will be danger. Cows are infected by many types of diseases and bugs and must be regularly cleaned and disinfected. Similarly, fences must be maintained around the cow pasture, and there is even more work to be done. If the cow gives no milk, however, then one certainly performs hard labor with no tangible result. Laborious effort is also required to learn the Sanskrit language well enough to discern the subtle and esoteric meaning of the Vedic mantras. If after such great labor one does not understand the spiritual body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is the source of all happiness in life, and if one does not surrender to the Lord as the supreme shelter of all things, then one has certainly labored hard with no tangible result other than his own labor. Even a liberated soul who has given up the bodily concept of life will fall down if he does not take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word ni\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ta, or \u201cexpert,\u201d indicates that one must ultimately achieve the goal of life; otherwise one is not expert. As stated by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, prem\u0101 pum-artho mah\u0101n: the actual goal of human life is love of Godhead, and no one can be considered expert without achieving this goal."

        "translation": "My dear Uddhava, that man is certainly most miserable who takes care of a cow that gives no milk, an unchaste wife, a body totally dependent on others, useless children or wealth not utilized for the right purpose. Similarly, one who studies Vedic knowledge devoid of My glories is also most miserable.",
        "purport": " A human being is actually learned or expert when he understands that all material objects perceived through the various senses are expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that nothing exists without the support of the Supreme Lord. In this verse, through various examples, it is concluded that the power of speech is useless if not engaged for the Supreme Lord. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, this verse implies that all of the functions of the various senses are useless if they are not engaged in the glorification of God. Indeed, the avadh\u016bta br\u0101hma\u1e47a previously stated to King Yadu that if the tongue is not controlled, one\u2019s entire program of sense control is a failure. One cannot control the tongue unless he vibrates the glories of the Lord. The example of the milkless cow is significant. A gentleman never kills a cow, and therefore when a cow becomes sterile and no longer gives milk, one must engage in the laborious task of protecting her, since no one will purchase a useless cow. For some time, the greedy owner of a sterile cow may continue thinking, \u201cI have already invested so much money in taking care of this cow, and certainly in the near future she will again become pregnant and give milk.\u201d But when this hope is proven futile, he becomes neglectful and indifferent to the health and safety of the animal. Because of such sinful neglect, he must suffer in the next life, after having already suffered because of the sterile cow in the present life. Similarly, although a man may discover that his wife is neither chaste nor affectionate, he may be so eager to get children that he goes on taking care of such a useless wife, thinking, \u201cI will teach my wife the religious duties of a chaste woman. By hearing historical examples of great women surely her heart will change, and she will become a wonderful wife to me.\u201d Unfortunately, the unchaste wife in many cases does not change and also gives a man many useless children who are just as foolish and irreligious as she. Such children never give any happiness to the father, yet the father tediously labors to take care of them. Also, one who has accumulated wealth by the mercy of God must be vigilant to give in charity to the right person and for the right cause. If such a right person or cause appears and one hesitates and selfishly does not give in charity, one loses his reputation, and in the next life he will be poverty-stricken. One who fails to give properly in charity spends his life anxiously protecting his wealth, which ultimately brings him no fame or happiness. The previous examples are given to illustrate the uselessness of laboriously studying Vedic knowledge that does not glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b comments that the spiritual vibration of the Vedas is meant to bring one to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Many processes for achieving the Supreme Truth are recommended in the Upani\u1e63ads and other Vedic literatures, but because of their innumerable and seemingly contradictory explanations, commentaries and injunctions, one cannot achieve the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, merely by reading such literature. If, however, one understands \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the ultimate cause of all causes and reads the Upani\u1e63ads and other Vedic literature as glorification of the Supreme Lord, then one can actually become fixed at the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. For example, His Divine Grace \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da translated and commented upon \u015ar\u012b \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad in such a way that it brings the reader closer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Undoubtedly, the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are the only reliable boat by which to cross the turbulent ocean of material existence. Even Lord Brahm\u0101 has stated in the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that if one gives up the auspicious path of bhakti and takes to the fruitless labor of Vedic speculation, one is just like a fool who beats empty husks in hopes of getting rice. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b recommends that one completely ignore dry Vedic speculation because it does not bring one to the point of devotional service to the Absolute Truth, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "purport": " The words l\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101repsita-janma are very significant here. The Lord\u2019s incarnation for executing wonderful pastimes is called l\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101ra, and such wonderful forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are glorified by the names R\u0101macandra, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, K\u016brma, Var\u0101ha, and so on. Among all such l\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101ras, however, the most beloved, even to this day, is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the original source of the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva. The Lord appears in the prison house of Ka\u1e41sa and is immediately transferred to the rural setting of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where He exhibits unique childhood pastimes with His cowherd boyfriends, girlfriends, parents and well-wishers. After some time, the Lord\u2019s pastimes are transferred to Mathur\u0101 and Dv\u0101rak\u0101, and the extraordinary love of the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is exhibited in their anguished separation from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such pastimes of the Lord are \u012bpsita, or the reservoir of all loving exchanges with the Absolute Truth. The pure devotees of the Lord are most intelligent and expert and do not pay any attention to useless, fruitless literatures that neglect the highest truth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although such literatures are very popular among materialistic persons all over the world, they are completely neglected by the community of pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. In this verse the Lord explains that the literatures approved for the devotees are those that glorify the Lord\u2019s pastimes as the puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ra and the l\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101ras, culminating in the personal appearance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, as confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.39): \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who manifested Himself personally as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the different avat\u0101ras in the world in the forms of R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, V\u0101mana, etc., as His subjective portions.\u201d Even Vedic literatures that neglect the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be ignored. This fact was also explained by N\u0101rada Muni to \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva, the author of the Vedas, when the great Vedavy\u0101sa felt dissatisfied with his work."

        "translation": "Coming to this conclusion of all knowledge, one should give up the false conception of material variety that one imposes upon the soul and thus cease one\u2019s material existence. The mind should be fixed on Me, since I am all-pervading.",
        "purport": " Although in previous verses Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has described the lifestyle and approach of the impersonal philosophers who meditate on the distinction between matter and spirit, the Lord here rejects the path of j\u00f1\u0101na, or speculation, and comes to the final conclusion, bhakti-yoga. The path of j\u00f1\u0101na is interesting only to one who does not know that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19): The words v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti, or \u201cV\u0101sudeva is everything,\u201d are similar to the words sarva-ge found in this verse. One should know why the Personality of Godhead is all-pervading. The first verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam states, janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25: the Supreme Lord is the source of everything. And as stated in the previous verse of this chapter, He creates, maintains and annihilates everything. Thus the Lord is not all-pervading in the manner of air or sunlight; rather, the Lord is all-pervading as the absolute controller who holds in His hands the destiny of every living entity. Everything is ultimately an expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore there is really no other object of meditation besides K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Meditation upon any other object is also meditation on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but is imperfectly performed, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the word avidhi-p\u016brvakam. The Lord also states in the G\u012bt\u0101 that all living entities are on the path back home, back to Godhead. Because of ignorance, however, some of them go backward or stop along the way, foolishly thinking that their journey is finished, when in fact they are suspended in one of the minor potencies of the Supreme Lord. If one wants to intimately understand the nature of the Absolute Truth, one must take to the path of love of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55): \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d The words n\u0101n\u0101tva-bhramam in this verse indicate false identification with the gross and subtle material bodies. The word bhramam indicates a mistake; it can also mean \u201cwandering\u201d or \u201crotating.\u201d The conditioned living entity, because of his mistake of falling into illusion, is wandering through a succession of material bodies, sometimes appearing as a demigod and sometimes as a worm in stool. The word up\u0101rameta means that one should stop such fruitless wandering and fix one\u2019s mind on the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord, who is the true object of everyone\u2019s love. Such a conclusion is not sentimental but is the result of keen analytic intelligence (jij\u00f1\u0101say\u0101). Thus after elaborately explaining to Uddhava many aspects of analytic knowledge, the Lord now comes to the ultimate conclusion, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, pure love of Godhead. Without such love there is no question of eternally fixing one\u2019s mind on the Lord. Quoting from the Viveka, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya states that n\u0101n\u0101tva-bhramam indicates the following illusions: considering the living entity to be the Supreme; considering all living entities to be ultimately one entity without separate individuality; considering that there are many Gods; thinking that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not God; and considering that the material universe is the ultimate reality. All of these illusions are called bhrama, or mistakes, but such ignorance can be eliminated at once by the chanting of the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."

        "translation": "My dear Uddhava, if you are not able to free your mind from all material disturbance and thus absorb it completely on the spiritual platform, then perform all your activities as an offering to Me, without trying to enjoy the fruits.",
        "purport": " If one offers one\u2019s activities to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without trying to enjoy the results, one\u2019s mind becomes purified. When the mind is purified, transcendental knowledge automatically manifests, since such knowledge is a by-product of pure consciousness. When the mind is absorbed in perfect knowledge, it can be raised to the spiritual platform, as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): \u201cOne who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\u201d By absorbing the mind in the transcendental form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can surpass the stage of ordinary transcendental knowledge, by which one simply distinguishes oneself from the gross and subtle material bodies. Spiritually enriched by loving devotional service to the Lord, the mind is completely purified of all tinges of illusion. Through intense concentration on one\u2019s relationship with the Personality of Godhead one comes to the highest standard of knowledge and becomes an intimate associate of the Personality of Godhead. By offering one\u2019s activities to the Personality of Godhead, one purifies one\u2019s mind to some extent and thus comes to the preliminary stage of spiritual awareness. Yet even then one may not be able to fix one\u2019s mind completely on the spiritual platform. At that point one should realistically assess one\u2019s position, noting the lingering material contamination within the mind. Then, as stated in this verse, one should intensify one\u2019s practical devotional work in the service of the Lord. If one artificially considers oneself to be supremely liberated or if one becomes casual on the path of spiritual advancement, there is serious danger of a falldown. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the Lord previously explained to Uddhava j\u00f1\u0101na-mi\u015br\u0101 bhakti, or devotional service mixed with the impure desire to enjoy transcendental knowledge. In this verse the Lord clearly reveals that transcendental knowledge is an automatic by-product of loving service to the Lord, and in the next verse the Lord begins His explanation of pure devotional service, which is completely sufficient for self-realization. The desire to enjoy spiritual knowledge is certainly a material desire, since the goal is one\u2019s personal satisfaction and not the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here warns Uddhava that if one is not able to fix one\u2019s mind in trance on the spiritual platform, then one should not go on simply theoretically discussing what is Brahman and what is not Brahman. Rather, one should engage in practical devotional service to the Supreme Lord, and then spiritual knowledge will automatically awaken in one\u2019s heart. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d Similarly, in the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam Lord Brahm\u0101 warns that one should not neglect the auspicious path of bhakti and instead take up the useless labor of mental speculation. By mere philosophical speculation one cannot fix one\u2019s mind on the spiritual platform. Many great philosophers throughout history had abominable personal habits, which proves that they could not fix themselves on the spiritual platform by mere speculation on philosophical categories. If one is not fortunate enough to have executed devotional service to the Lord in one\u2019s past life, and if one is therefore addicted to mere speculation on the differences between matter and spirit, one will not be able to fix one\u2019s mind on the spiritual platform. Such a person should give up useless speculation and engage in the practical work of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, absorbing himself twenty-four hours a day in the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In such missionary work for the Lord\u2019s sake, one should never try to enjoy the fruits of one\u2019s work. Even though the mind is not completely pure, if one offers the fruits of one\u2019s work to the Lord, the mind will quickly come to the standard of pure desirelessness, in which one\u2019s only desire is the Lord\u2019s satisfaction. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b states that if one does not have faith in the personal form and activities of the Personality of Godhead, one will not have the spiritual strength to remain perpetually on the transcendental platform. In this verse the Lord is definitely bringing Uddhava, and all living entities, to the conclusion of all philosophy \u2014 pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura points out that one who is bewildered by false ego may not want to offer his activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though this is the actual way of rising above the influence of the modes of material nature. Because of ignorance one does not know that he is the eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and instead is attracted by the duality of material illusion. One cannot become free from such illusion by theoretical speculation, but if one offers one\u2019s work to the Personality of Godhead, one will clearly understand his eternal, transcendental position as a servant of the Lord."

        "translation": "My dear Uddhava, narrations of My pastimes and qualities are all-auspicious and purify the entire universe. A faithful person who constantly hears, glorifies and remembers such transcendental activities, who through dramatic performances relives My pastimes, beginning with My appearance, and who takes full shelter of Me, dedicating his religious, sensual and occupational activities for My satisfaction, certainly obtains unflinching devotional service to Me, the eternal Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " Those who have faith only in the impersonal effulgent aspect of the Supreme Lord and those who have faith only in the localized Supersoul, the perfect object of mystic meditation located in the heart of every living entity, are considered to be limited and imperfect in their transcendental realization. The process of mystic meditation and impersonal philosophical speculation are both devoid of actual love of God and therefore cannot be considered to be the perfection of human life. Only one who places full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes qualified to go back home, back to Godhead. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes of stealing butter from the elderly gop\u012bs, enjoying life with His cowherd boyfriends and the young gop\u012bs, playing His flute and engaging in the r\u0101sa dance, etc., are all-auspicious spiritual activities, and they are fully described in the Tenth Canto of this work. There are many authorized songs and prayers glorifying these pastimes of the Lord, and by constantly chanting them one will automatically be fixed in smara\u1e47am, or remembrance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord exhibited His opulences upon His birth in Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s prison and at the birth ceremony subsequently performed by Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja in Gokula. The Lord further performed many adventurous activities, such as chastising the serpent K\u0101liya and killing many other demons. One should regularly take part in the ceremonies commemorating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes, such as the Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b celebration glorifying the Lord\u2019s birth. On such days one should worship the Deity of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the spiritual master and thus remember the Lord\u2019s pastimes. The word dharma in this verse indicates that one\u2019s religious activities should always be in connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, one should give charity in the form of food grains, clothing, etc., to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and whenever possible one should arrange for the protection of cows, who are very dear to the Lord. The word k\u0101ma indicates that one should satisfy one\u2019s desires with the transcendental paraphernalia of the Lord. One should eat mah\u0101-pras\u0101dam, food offered to the Deity of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one should also decorate oneself with the Lord\u2019s flower garlands and sandalwood pulp and should place the remnants of the Deity\u2019s clothing on one\u2019s body. One who lives in a luxurious mansion or apartment should convert his residence into a temple of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and invite others to come, chant before the Deity, hear Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and taste the remnants of the Lord\u2019s food, or one may live in a beautiful temple building in the community of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and engage in the same activities. The word artha in this verse indicates that one who is inclined toward business should accumulate money to promote the missionary work of the Lord\u2019s devotees and not for one\u2019s personal sense gratification. Thus one\u2019s business activities are also considered to be devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The word ni\u015bcal\u0101m indicates that since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is eternally fixed in perfect knowledge and bliss, there is no possibility of disturbance for one who worships the Lord. If we worship anything except the Lord, our worship may be disturbed when our worshipable deity is placed in an awkward position. But because the Lord is supreme, our worship of Him is eternally free of disturbance. One who engages in hearing, glorifying, remembering and dramatically recreating the pastimes of the Lord will soon be freed from all material desire. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b mentions in this connection that one who is advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may specifically be attracted to the pastimes of a devotee in the spiritual world who serves the Lord in a particular way. An advanced devotee in this world may desire to serve the Lord in the same way and thus may take pleasure in dramatically reliving the service of his worshipable devotee-master in the spiritual world. Also, one may take pleasure in spiritual festivals, performances of particular pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or activities of other devotees of the Lord. In this way, one can continually increase one\u2019s faith in the Personality of Godhead. Those who have no desire to hear, glorify or remember the transcendental activities of the Lord are certainly materially polluted and never achieve the highest perfection. Such persons spoil the opportunity of human life by devoting themselves to fleeting mundane topics that produce no eternal benefit. The real meaning of religion is to constantly serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. One who has taken full shelter of the Lord is completely uninterested in impersonal speculations about the nature of God and uses his time to advance more and more in the unlimited bliss of pure devotional service."

        "purport": " In the previous verses Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has emphasized the value of surrendering to Him in loving service. One may ask how such surrender or devotion is actually achieved. The Lord gives the answer in this verse. One must live in a society of devotees, and thus automatically one will be engaged twenty-four hours a day in the various processes of devotional service, beginning with \u015brava\u1e47am, k\u012brtanam and smara\u1e47am (hearing, glorifying and remembering the Lord). The pure devotees of the Lord can reveal the spiritual world by their transcendental sound vibration, making it possible for even a neophyte devotee to experience the Lord\u2019s abode. Being thus enlivened, the neophyte makes further progress and gradually becomes qualified to personally serve the Personality of Godhead in the spiritual world. By constantly associating with devotees and learning from them about devotional science, one quickly achieves a deep attachment for the Lord and the Lord\u2019s service, and such attachment gradually matures into pure love of Godhead. Foolish persons say that the various mantras composed of names of God, as well as all other mantras, are merely material creations with no special value, and therefore any so-called mantra or mystical process will ultimately produce the same result. To refute such superficial thinking, the Lord here describes the science of going back home, back to Godhead. One should not accept the bad association of impersonalists, who state that the holy name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Lord are m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion. M\u0101y\u0101 is actually an insignificant potency of the almighty Personality of Godhead, and if one ignorantly tries to elevate illusion above the Absolute Truth, one will never experience love of Godhead and will be cast into deep forgetfulness of the Lord. One should not associate with those who are envious of the fortunate devotees who are going back to Godhead. Such envious persons deride the abode of the Lord, which is revealed by the pure devotees to those who have faith in the Lord\u2019s message. Envious persons create disturbances among the people in general, who should take shelter of the faithful devotees of the Lord. Unless people hear from pure devotees, it is impossible for them to understand that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead eternally existing in His own abode, which is self-luminous, full of bliss and knowledge. In this verse, the importance of sa\u1e45ga, association, is clearly explained."

My dear ruler of the universal controllers, O Lord of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and almighty God of the universe, I am Your devotee, and because I love You I have no other shelter than You. Therefore please explain this to me.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse it was stated that one can achieve the Lord\u2019s supreme abode by associating with devotees. Therefore, Uddhava naturally inquires about the symptoms of a distinguished devotee whose association can promote one to the kingdom of God. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b notes that the Personality of Godhead knows who is actually a sincere devotee because the Lord is always attached to His loving servitors. Similarly, pure devotees can expertly explain the proper methods of devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they are already absorbed in love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Uddhava herein requests Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to describe the qualities of a devotee and asks the Lord to explain the devotional service that the devotees themselves approve as worthy to be offered to the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks that the word puru\u1e63\u0101dhyak\u1e63a indicates that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme ruler of the universal controllers headed by Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and thus the Lord possesses infinite sovereignty. The term lok\u0101dhyak\u1e63a indicates that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate supervising authority of all of the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, and therefore the Lord is unlimitedly glorious and perfect. Uddhava further addresses Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as jagat-prabhu, because even in the illusory material world the Lord exhibits His unlimited mercy by personally incarnating to uplift the conditioned souls. The word pra\u1e47at\u0101ya (\u201cYour surrendered devotee\u201d) indicates that Uddhava is not proud like ordinary fools who do not enjoy bowing down to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, Uddhava mentions that he is anurakt\u0101ya, or completely bound in love to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because unlike other great devotees such as Arjuna, who sometimes worshiped demigods in order to comply with social customs or to show respect for their positions in the scheme of planetary management, Uddhava never worshiped any demigods. Therefore, Uddhava is prapann\u0101ya, or completely surrendered to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, having no other shelter."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, as the Absolute Truth You are transcendental to material nature, and like the sky You are never entangled in any way. Still, being controlled by Your devotees\u2019 love, You accept many different forms, incarnating according to Your devotees\u2019 desires.",
        "purport": " The pure devotees of the Lord propagate devotional service all over the world, and therefore, although separate from the personal form of the Lord, they are considered to be manifestations of God\u2019s mercy and potency. As stated in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Antya 7.11): k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-\u015bakti vin\u0101 nahe t\u0101ra pravartana. The Lord is like the sky (vyoma) because although expanded everywhere, He is not entangled in anything. He is prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 para\u1e25, or completely transcendental to material nature. The Lord is fully self-satisfied and is therefore indifferent to the affairs of the material world. Still, because of His causeless mercy, the Lord desires to expand pure devotional service, and for this reason He incarnates within the material world to uplift the fallen conditioned souls. The Lord descends in selected spiritual bodies to please His loving devotees. Sometimes He appears in His original form as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And even K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself appears in different forms to special devotees so that they may fully develop their loving sentiments for Him. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b gives several examples of the Lord\u2019s special mercy upon His devotees. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally went to the home of J\u0101mbav\u0101n and there displayed a form with slightly angry glances. In that form, the Lord enjoyed a fight with His devotee. The Lord displayed His form as Datt\u0101treya to Atri Muni and similarly bestowed special mercy upon Lord Brahm\u0101, the demigods, Akr\u016bra and innumerable other devotees. And in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana the Lord displayed His most beautiful form as Govinda to the fortunate inhabitants. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted from the Prak\u0101\u015ba-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as follows. \u201cThe Lord accepts different spiritual bodies according to the desire of His devotees. For example, the Lord agreed to become the son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b. Thus, although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has an eternal, blissful spiritual form, He appears to enter within the body of His devotee who becomes His mother. Although we speak of the Lord\u2019s \u2018taking on a body,\u2019 the Lord does not change His form, as do the conditioned souls, who must change their material bodies. The Lord appears in His own eternally unchangeable forms. Lord Hari always appears in the forms that are especially desired by His loving devotees, and never in other forms. However, if one thinks that the Lord, in the manner of an ordinary person taking birth, becomes the physical son of Vasudeva or other devotees, then one is victimized by illusion. The Lord merely expands His spiritual potency, causing His pure devotees to think, \u2018K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is now my son.\u2019 One should understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead never accepts or rejects a material body, nor does He ever give up His eternal spiritual forms; rather, the Lord eternally manifests His blissful bodies according to the loving sentiments of His eternal pure devotees.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b mentions that the word vyoma also indicates the Lord\u2019s name of Paravyoma, or the Lord of the spiritual sky. One should not misinterpret this verse to mean that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is impersonal, like the material sky, or that the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is merely another selected incarnation equal to any other. Such casual and whimsical speculations cannot be accepted as actual spiritual knowledge. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Personality of Godhead (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam), and the Lord has explained elaborately in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that He is the original source of everything. Therefore, the pure devotees of the Lord are eternally engaged, in full knowledge and bliss, in loving service to the Lord\u2019s original form as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The whole purpose of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is to arouse our love for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one should not foolishly misunderstand this great purpose."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O Uddhava, a saintly person is merciful and never injures others. Even if others are aggressive he is tolerant and forgiving toward all living entities. His strength and meaning in life come from the truth itself, he is free from all envy and jealousy, and his mind is equal in material happiness and distress. Thus, he dedicates his time to work for the welfare of all others. His intelligence is never bewildered by material desires, and he has controlled his senses. His behavior is always pleasing, never harsh and always exemplary, and he is free from possessiveness. He never endeavors in ordinary, worldly activities, and he strictly controls his eating. He therefore always remains peaceful and steady. A saintly person is thoughtful and accepts Me as his only shelter. Such a person is very cautious in the execution of his duties and is never subject to superficial transformations, because he is steady and noble, even in a distressing situation. He has conquered over the six material qualities \u2014 namely hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death. He is free from all desire for prestige and offers honor to others. He is expert in reviving the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness of others and therefore never cheats anyone. Rather, he is a well-wishing friend to all, being most merciful. Such a saintly person must be considered the most learned of men. He perfectly understands that the ordinary religious duties prescribed by Me in various Vedic scriptures possess favorable qualities that purify the performer, and he knows that neglect of such duties constitutes a discrepancy in one\u2019s life. Having taken complete shelter at My lotus feet, however, a saintly person ultimately renounces such ordinary religious duties and worships Me alone. He is thus considered to be the best among all living entities.",
        "purport": " Verses 29-31 describe twenty-eight qualities of a saintly person, and verse 32 explains the highest perfection of life. According to \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the seventeenth quality (mat-\u015bara\u1e47a, or taking complete shelter of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) is the most important, and the other twenty-seven qualities automatically appear in one who has become a pure devotee of the Lord. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.18.12), yasy\u0101sti bhaktir bhagavaty aki\u00f1can\u0101 sarvair gu\u1e47ais tatra sam\u0101sate sur\u0101\u1e25. The twenty-eight saintly qualities may be described as follows. (1) K\u1e5bp\u0101lu. A devotee cannot tolerate seeing the world merged in ignorance and suffering the whiplashes of m\u0101y\u0101. Therefore he busily engages in distributing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and is called k\u1e5bp\u0101lu, or merciful. (2) Ak\u1e5bta-droha. Even if someone is offensive toward a devotee, a devotee does not become offensive in return. Indeed, he never acts against the interest of any living entity. One may argue that great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava kings, such as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, executed many criminals. However, when justice is properly administered by the state, sinful, destructive persons actually benefit from their punishment because they become freed from the severe karmic reactions to their illicit activities. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava ruler gives punishment not out of envy or malice, but in faithful obedience to the laws of God. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers who want to kill God by imagining that He does not exist are certainly k\u1e5bta-droha, or most injurious to themselves and others. The impersonalist imagines that he himself is supreme and thus creates a most dangerous situation for himself and his followers. Similarly, the karm\u012bs, who are dedicated to material sense gratification, are also killers of the self, because by their absorption in material consciousness they lose all chance of experiencing the Absolute Truth and the truth of their own self. Therefore, all living entities who come under the control of materialistic regulations and duties are unnecessarily harassing themselves and others, and a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava feels great compassion and concern for them. A devotee never uses his mind, body or words to perform any act harmful to the welfare of any living entity. (3) Titik\u1e63u. A devotee forgives and forgets any offense against himself. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is personally detached from his material body, which is made of pus, stool, blood, and so on. Therefore the devotee is able to overlook the obnoxious behavior he sometimes meets with in the course of preaching work and always deals with people as a perfect gentleman. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava loudly chants the holy name of the Lord and tolerates and forgives those fallen conditioned souls who are unable to reciprocate properly with a pure devotee. (4) Satya-s\u0101ra. A devotee always remembers that he is the eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is omniscient, the reservoir of all pleasure and the ultimate enjoyer of all activities. By avoiding activities outside devotional service, a devotee remains fixed in the truth, does not uselessly waste time and thus becomes bold, powerful and steady. (5) Anavady\u0101tm\u0101. A devotee knows that the material world is a temporary phantasmagoria and therefore does not envy anyone in any material situation. He never tries to agitate others or criticize them unnecessarily. (6) Sama. A devotee remains steady and equal in material happiness or distress, fame or infamy. His actual wealth is his consciousness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he understands that his real self-interest lies outside the scope of material nature. He does not become excited or depressed by external events, but remains fixed in consciousness of the omnipotency of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. (7) Sarvopak\u0101raka. Neglecting one\u2019s selfish desires and working for the satisfaction of others is called paropak\u0101ra, whereas causing trouble to others for one\u2019s personal gratification is called par\u0101pak\u0101ra. A devotee always works for the pleasure of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the resting place of all living entities, and thus a devotee\u2019s activities are ultimately pleasing to everyone. Devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the perfectional stage of welfare work, since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller of everyone\u2019s happiness and distress. Foolish persons under the influence of false egotism, considering themselves to be the ultimate well-wishers of others, execute superficial materialistic activities rather than attending to the eternal happiness of others. Because a devotee remains pure and engages in missionary activities, he is everyone\u2019s best friend. (8) K\u0101mair ahata-dh\u012b. Ordinary persons see all material things as objects for their personal gratification and thus try to acquire or control them. Ultimately a man wants to possess a woman and enjoy sex gratification with her. The Supreme Lord supplies the desired fuel that causes the fire of lust to burn painfully in one\u2019s heart, but the Lord does not give self-realization to such a misguided person. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental and neutral, but if one is eager to exploit the Lord\u2019s creation, the Lord gives one facility through m\u0101y\u0101, and one becomes cheated of real happiness by entangling himself in the false role of a great and lusty enjoyer of the world. On the other hand, one who has taken full shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is enriched with perfect knowledge and bliss and is not cheated by the seductive appearances of the material world. A pure devotee does not follow the path of the foolish deer, which is seduced by the hunter\u2019s horn and killed. A devotee is never attracted by the sensuous entreaties of a beautiful woman, and he avoids hearing from bewildered karm\u012bs about the so-called glories of material acquisition. Similarly, a pure devotee is not bewildered by aroma or taste. He does not become attached to sumptuous eating, nor does he spend the whole day making arrangements for bodily comfort. The only actual enjoyer of God\u2019s creation is the Lord Himself, and the living entities are secondary enjoyers who experience unlimited pleasure through the Lord\u2019s pleasure. This perfect process of experiencing pleasure is called bhakti-yoga, or pure devotional service, and a devotee never sacrifices his auspicious position of steady intelligence, even in the face of so-called material opportunity. (9) D\u0101nta. A devotee is naturally repelled by sinful activities and controls his senses by dedicating all his acts to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This requires steady concentration and a cautious mentality. (10) M\u1e5bdu. A materialistic person will always see people as friends or enemies and thus will sometimes justify cruel or small-minded behavior in order to subdue his opponents. Since a devotee has taken shelter of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he does not consider anyone his enemy and is never disturbed by the tendency to desire or enjoy the suffering of others. Thus he is m\u1e5bdu, or gentle and sublime. (11) \u015auci. A devotee never touches that which is impure or improper, and simply by remembering such a pure devotee, one is freed from the tendency to sin. Because of his perfect behavior, a devotee is called \u015buci, or pure. (12) Aki\u00f1cana. A devotee is free from possessiveness and is not eager to enjoy or renounce anything, since he considers everything to be Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s property. (13) An\u012bha. A devotee never acts on his own behalf, but rather for the service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is therefore aloof from ordinary, worldly affairs. (14) Mita-bhuk. A devotee accepts material sense objects only as far as necessary, to keep himself healthy and fit in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. He is therefore not entangled by his sense activities and never injures his self-realization. When necessary, a devotee can give up anything for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, but he does not accept or reject anything for his personal prestige. (15) \u015a\u0101nta. Those trying to exploit the Lord\u2019s creation are always disturbed. A devotee, however, is detached from such pointless activities and understands sense gratification to be diametrically opposed to his self-interest. Being always engaged according to the Lord\u2019s desire, he remains peaceful. (16) Sthira. Remembering that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the basis of everything, a devotee does not become fearful or impatient. (17) Mat-\u015bara\u1e47a. A devotee does not take pleasure in anything except serving Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and is constantly attentive in the execution of his duties. A devotee knows that only Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can protect him and engage him in useful work. (18) Muni. A devotee is thoughtful and through intelligent contemplation avoids becoming distracted from his spiritual advancement. By intelligence he is freed from doubts about Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and confronts all problems in life with steady K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. (19) Apramatta. One who forgets the Supreme Lord is more or less crazy, but a devotee remains sane by offering his activities to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. (20) Gabh\u012br\u0101tm\u0101. As a devotee merges into the ocean of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his own consciousness becomes deeper and deeper; ordinary, superficial persons hovering on the material platform cannot fathom the extent of a devotee\u2019s awareness. (21) Dh\u1e5btim\u0101n. By controlling the urges of the tongue and genitals the devotee remains steady and patient and does not impulsively change his position. (22) Jita-\u1e63a\u1e0d-gu\u1e47a. By spiritual knowledge, a devotee is able to conquer the pushings of hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death. (23) Am\u0101n\u012b. A devotee is not puffed up, and even if he is famous, he does not take such fame very seriously. (24) M\u0101na-da. A devotee offers all respects to others, since everyone is part and parcel of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. (25) Kalya. A devotee is expert in making people understand the truth of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. (26) Maitra. A devotee does not cheat anyone by encouraging them in the bodily concept of life; rather, by his missionary work a devotee is the true friend of everyone. (27) K\u0101ru\u1e47ika. A devotee tries to make people sane and thus is most merciful. He is para-du\u1e25kha-du\u1e25kh\u012b, or one who is unhappy to see the unhappiness of others. (28) Kavi. A devotee is expert in studying the transcendental qualities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and is able to show the harmony and compatibility of the Lord\u2019s apparently contradictory qualities. This is possible through expert knowledge of the absolute nature of the Lord. Lord Caitanya is softer than a rose and harder than a thunderbolt, but these opposing qualities can easily be understood in terms of the Lord\u2019s transcendental nature and purpose. One who is always able to understand the truth of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, without opposition or confusion, is called kavi, or most learned. The position of those on the spiritual path can be understood in terms of their development of the qualities mentioned above. Ultimately, the most important quality is to take shelter of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, since the Lord can award all good qualities to His sincere devotee. In the lowest stage of devotional service one acts with a desire to enjoy sense gratification but at the same time tries to offer the fruits to the Lord. This stage is called karma-mi\u015br\u0101 bhakti. As one gradually purifies himself in devotional service, he becomes detached through knowledge and gains relief from anxiety. In this stage he becomes attached to transcendental knowledge, and therefore this stage is called j\u00f1\u0101na-mi\u015br\u0101 bhakti, or devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with a desire to enjoy the fruits of transcendental knowledge. But because pure love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually the greatest happiness and the natural position of the living entity, a sincere devotee gradually overcomes his desire to enjoy sense gratification and knowledge and comes to the stage of pure devotional service, which is devoid of personal desire. Na karm\u0101\u1e47i tyajed yog\u012b karmabhis tyajyate hi sa\u1e25: \u201cThe yog\u012b should not give up his work, but rather should cultivate detachment by which his material activities will automatically vanish.\u201d In other words, one should continue to perform one\u2019s prescribed duties, even imperfectly. If one is sincere about advancing in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then by the strength of bhakti-yoga his activities will gradually be transformed into pure loving service. There are innumerable examples of fruitive workers, mental speculators and materialistic devotees who became perfect by the strength of devotional service. By rendering loving service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one automatically experiences the greatest pleasure of life and is endowed with perfect knowledge. There is nothing lacking in the process of pure devotional service, and there is no need for any extraneous endeavor to acquire sense pleasure or philosophical satisfaction. One must be completely convinced that simply by serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one will get all perfection in life. Even if one lacks some or all of the above-mentioned qualities, one should sincerely engage in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, and gradually one\u2019s character will become perfect. One who is a sincere devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will develop all godly qualities by the mercy of the Lord, and one who is already serving the Lord with the above-mentioned qualities is to be understood as the greatest devotee. As indicated in verse 32, a pure devotee of the Lord is fully aware of the pious advantages of executing duties within the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, and he is similarly aware of the harmful mistake of neglecting such duties. Still, having full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee gives up all ordinary social and religious activities and engages fully in devotional service. He knows that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate source of everything and that all perfection comes from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a alone. Because of his extraordinary faith, the devotee is called sattama, or the best among all living beings. As explained by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in Upade\u015b\u0101m\u1e5bta, a devotee who has not yet developed the good qualities mentioned above but is nevertheless sincerely endeavoring for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should receive the mercy of superior Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. One should not necessarily accept intimate association with such an aspirant to pure devotional service, but one should be confident that by chanting the holy names of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a such a person will eventually attain all perfection. One can imagine the beauty of a society filled with saintly persons, as described in these verses. The wonderful K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious qualities mentioned above are the basis of a peaceful and prosperous society, and if everyone takes to the loving service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then certainly the present atmosphere of fear, violence, lust, greed and insanity can be replaced by a celestial situation in which all leaders and citizens will be happy. The essential points here are mat-\u015bara\u1e47a (\u201cone should take full shelter of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u201d) and m\u0101\u1e41 bhajeta (\u201cone should worship the Lord through the authorized process\u201d). In this way the entire world can become sattama, or most perfect."

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, although y\u0101v\u0101n indicates that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be limited by time or space, He becomes limited by the love of His pure devotees. For example, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never steps one foot out of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, because of the intense love of its inhabitants for Him. In this way, the Lord comes under the control of His devotees\u2019 love. The word ya\u1e25 indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Absolute Truth who appears as the son of Vasudeva, or as \u015ay\u0101masundara. Y\u0101d\u1e5b\u015ba indicates that the Lord is \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma, or completely self-satisfied, and also \u0101pta-k\u0101ma, or \u201cone who automatically fulfills all of His desires.\u201d Still, being affected by the love of His devotees, the Lord sometimes appears to be an\u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma, or dependent on the love of His devotees, and an\u0101ptak\u0101ma, unable to achieve His desire without the cooperation of His devotees. Actually, the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is always independent, but He reciprocates the intense love of His devotees and thus appears to be dependent on them, just as He apparently became dependent on Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Ya\u015bod\u0101 during His childhood pastimes in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. The word aj\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 (\u201cinexperienced, lacking knowledge\u201d) indicates that sometimes a devotee may not have a proper philosophical understanding of the Personality of Godhead or due to love may temporarily forget the Lord\u2019s position. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (11.41) Arjuna says: \u201cI have in the past addressed You as \u2018O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u2019 \u2018O Y\u0101dava,\u2019 \u2018O my friend,\u2019 without knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love.\u201d Arjuna\u2019s words aj\u0101nat\u0101 mahim\u0101nam have the same meaning as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s words aj\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 m\u0101m in this verse of the Bh\u0101gavatam. Both indicate incomplete understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s glories. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Arjuna says, pra\u1e47ayena: his forgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme position was caused by his love for Him. In this verse, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a excuses such lapses on the part of His devotees with the words aj\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 m\u0101m, which indicate that even though devotees may not fully appreciate His exalted position, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a accepts their loving service. Thus this verse clearly reveals the supreme position of bhakti. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (11.54): \u201cMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.\u201d Although one may develop innumerable saintly qualities, without love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one will not achieve complete success. One must understand the Personality of Godhead as He is and love Him. Even if one is not capable of analytically understanding the position of God, if one simply loves K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then one is certainly perfect. Many of the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana had no idea that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor did they know of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s potencies or incarnations. They simply loved K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with their hearts and souls, and therefore they are considered most perfect."

        "translation": "My dear Uddhava, one can give up false pride and prestige by engaging in the following devotional activities. One may purify oneself by seeing, touching, worshiping, serving, and offering prayers of glorification and obeisances to My form as the Deity and to My pure devotees. One should also glorify My transcendental qualities and activities, hear with love and faith the narrations of My glories and constantly meditate on Me. One should offer to Me whatever one acquires, and accepting oneself as My eternal servant, one should give oneself completely to Me. One should always discuss My birth and activities and enjoy life by participating in festivals, such as Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b, which glorify My pastimes. In My temple, one should also participate in festivals and ceremonies by singing, dancing, playing musical instruments and discussing Me with other Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. One should observe all the regularly celebrated annual festivals by attending ceremonies, pilgrimages and making offerings. One should also observe religious vows such as Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b and take initiation by the procedures mentioned in the Vedas, Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra and other, similar literatures. One should faithfully and lovingly support the installation of My Deity, and individually or in cooperation with others one should work for the construction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious temples and cities as well as flower gardens, fruit gardens and special areas to celebrate My pastimes. One should consider oneself to be My humble servant, without duplicity, and thus should help to clean the temple, which is My home. First one should sweep and dust thoroughly, and then one should further cleanse with water and cow dung. Having dried the temple, one should sprinkle scented water and decorate the temple with ma\u1e47\u1e0dalas. One should thus act just like My servant. A devotee should never advertise his devotional activities; therefore his service will not be the cause of false pride. One should never use lamps that are offered to Me for other purposes simply because there is need of illumination, and similarly, one should never offer to Me anything that has been offered to or used by others. Whatever is most desired by one within this material world, and whatever is most dear to oneself \u2014 one should offer that very thing to Me. Such an offering qualifies one for eternal life.",
        "purport": " In these eight verses Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ends His discussion of saintly qualities in general and describes the specific characteristics of the devotees of the Lord. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has clearly described both here and in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the ultimate goal of life is to surrender fully to Him and become His pure devotee. Herein the Lord elaborately describes the process of devotional service. One should offer everything that one acquires to the Lord, thinking, \u201cLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has sent these things so that I may serve Him nicely.\u201d One ultimately should understand that the minute spirit soul is part and parcel of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus one should surrender one\u2019s very self to the Lord. Just as an ordinary servant is meek and submissive to his master, similarly, a devotee should always be submissive to his spiritual master, who is a representative of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He should realize how his body and mind are purified simply by his seeing the spiritual master or by accepting on his head the water offered to the spiritual master. It is emphasized in these verses that one should attend Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava festivals. As far as possible, large festivals should be held all over the world so that people can gradually learn how to perfect human life. The words mam\u0101rc\u0101-sth\u0101pane \u015braddh\u0101 are significant. Here Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states that one should have faith in His Deity worship, since the Lord is personally present as the Deity. The words udy\u0101nopavan\u0101kr\u012b\u1e0da-pura-mandira-karma\u1e47i indicate that there should be a serious endeavor to construct beautiful temples and Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava cities with ample parks, orchards and flower gardens. An outstanding example of such endeavors can be presently seen in India at the M\u0101y\u0101pur Candrodaya Mandira. The words d\u012bp\u0101valoka\u1e41 me nopayu\u00f1jy\u0101n niveditam indicate that one may never use the Deity\u2019s paraphernalia for sense gratification. If there is a shortage of electricity or lights, one may not use the Deity\u2019s lamps, nor should one ever offer to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a paraphernalia previously offered to or used by others. In these verses, the importance of Deity worship and Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava festivals is emphasized in many ways. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a promises that whoever sincerely performs these activities will certainly go back home, back to Godhead (tad \u0101nanty\u0101ya kalpate). One should offer his most dear possession to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not that which is superfluous or unwanted. If one is most attached to his family, one should see that his family is engaged in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. If one is most attached to money, that should be given for propagating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And if one considers one\u2019s intelligence to be most valuable, he should preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with great logic and reason. If we offer our most valuable possessions to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we will automatically become dear to the Lord and go back to Godhead."

I am worshiped within water by offerings of water itself, along with other elements such as flowers and tulas\u012b leaves, and one may worship Me within the earth by proper application of confidential seed mantras.

It is not recommended that one accept any material or spiritual object other than the Lord as supreme. By maintaining steady consciousness of the Lord in His all-pervading feature, one can remain in a worshipful mood twenty-four hours a day. Thus, one will naturally try to engage all material and spiritual elements in the loving service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If because of ignorance one forgets the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one may become inclined to worship powerful material phenomena independent of the Supreme Lord, or one may foolishly consider oneself to be supreme. One should remain sane and accept the worshipable presence of the Supreme Lord within everything."

        "purport": " The Lord has previously explained that He appears in different transcendental forms to His pure devotees so that they may unlimitedly increase their love of Godhead. Here is given a general description of the four-armed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form, which pervades the material world as Supersoul, or Param\u0101tm\u0101. The pure devotees, however, do not meditate upon the Lord within the heart but rather render active service to a specific form of the Lord, such as R\u0101ma or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus perfect their realization of Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Lord, who engages in transcendental pastimes with His devotees in the spiritual world. Yet even within the material world one can spiritualize one\u2019s existence by seeing the Supreme Lord within everything and worshiping Him by constant meditation. As mentioned in the previous verses, one should also go to the temple and specifically worship the Deity and participate in spiritual festivals. One should not be puffed up and claim that because one is meditating on the Lord within nature there is no need to go to the temple. Temple worship has been repeatedly emphasized by the Lord Himself. The word sam\u0101hita in this verse indicates sam\u0101dhi. If one very carefully worships the Deity or hears and chants about the pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is certainly in sam\u0101dhi. By worshiping and glorifying the Lord twenty-four hours a day one becomes a liberated soul and gradually rises completely beyond the influence of the material creation. The living entity is called \u0101tm\u0101, or eternal soul, because of his relationship with the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By worshiping the Lord, our eternal nature revives, and as we increase our enthusiasm and steadiness in devotional service, material existence fades away."

        "translation": "My dear Uddhava, I am personally the ultimate shelter and way of life for saintly liberated persons, and thus if one does not engage in My loving devotional service, which is made possible by associating with My devotees, then for all practical purposes, one possesses no effective means for escaping from material existence.",
        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has described to Uddhava the characteristics of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga, both of which are considered to be spiritual processes. Now, however, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly indicates that bhakti-yoga is the only real means to totally free oneself from material existence, and that bhakti-yoga is not possible without sat-sa\u1e45ga, or association with other Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. On the path of bhakti-mi\u015bra j\u00f1\u0101na, or speculation on the Absolute Truth mixed with devotion, one is still affected by the three modes of material nature. The pure soul, liberated from all material qualities, has no tendency or desire to engage in philosophical speculation, severe austerities or impersonal meditation. The pure soul simply loves K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and wants to serve Him constantly. J\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa.\u2019 Pure devotional service to the Lord is called kevala-bhakti, whereas devotional service mixed with speculative propensities is called gu\u1e47a-bh\u016bta-bhakti, or devotional service polluted by the material modes of nature. One who is actually intelligent does not make a show of philosophical wizardry but rather discerns the superiority of pure love of Godhead and takes to the path of kevala-bhakti. One who emphasizes so-called intellectual achievements is actually less intelligent, because such a person is more attracted to intelligence than to the pure soul, which is superior. It should be understood, however, that pure devotional service is not nonphilosophical or anti-intellectual. The Absolute Truth is far more extensive than partial truth. Therefore, one who is in full knowledge of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has the greatest facility to engage in philosophical analysis, since a pure devotee is working with the entire range of conceptual categories. Those who do not know Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are attracted to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, but they are not aware of the ultimate category of understanding called Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lacking knowledge of Bhagav\u0101n, such imperfect philosophers certainly do not understand the expansion, interaction and withdrawal of the Lord\u2019s innumerable potencies and thus cannot fully analyze them. By faithfully accepting everything Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speaks as the absolute truth, one comes to the mature platform of philosophy and achieves perfect knowledge. In addition to philosophical or intellectual understanding, pure devotional service also awards all other benefits in life, both material and spiritual; therefore one who for any purpose whatsoever accepts a process other than devotional service has unfortunately misunderstood the nature of pure devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is emphasized here that one must cultivate devotional service in the association of other devotees. On the other hand, the j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga process is cultivated alone, because it is difficult for even two mental speculators to be in the same place without their association degenerating into constant quarrel. Other processes of self-realization are compared to the nipples on a goat\u2019s neck. They look just like breast nipples, but they will not give any milk whatsoever. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has quoted the following verses, spoken by \u015ar\u012b Uddhava, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and N\u0101rada Muni respectively. \u201cMy dear Lord, for one who is being cruelly burned in the blazing fire of material miseries, having fallen into the network of material existence, I do not see any other possible shelter besides Your two lotus feet, which are a shower of nectar extinguishing the fire of suffering.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.19.9) \u201cMaterial existence is like an ocean that is extremely difficult to cross. The conditioned souls have fallen into this ocean, which is not cool but rather burns them with the fire of misery. For one who has fallen into this sea and desires to get out, there is no other rescue boat except the constant relishing within oneself of the pastime narrations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 12.4.40) \u201cWhat is the use of the yoga system, philosophical speculation, mere renunciation of the world, or Vedic studies? In fact, what is the use of any so-called auspicious process without Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the source of our very existence?\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 4.31.12) If, as stated in this verse, it is generally (pr\u0101ye\u1e47a) impossible to escape material bondage without devotional service in the association of devotees, one can simply imagine the probabilities of liberation in Kali-yuga without the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. The chances are certainly zero. One may concoct a type of liberation on the mental platform, or one may live in a so-called spiritual society of mutual flattery, but if one actually wants to go back home, back to Godhead, and see with spiritual eyes the beautiful kingdom of God called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, one must take to Lord Caitanya\u2019s movement and worship Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the association of the bhakta-ga\u1e47a, the devotees of the Lord."

Other processes of self realization, such as philosophical speculation, are imperfect and unsteady because the performer has personal desires, and there is no definite procedure by which to obtain the full mercy of the Supreme Lord.
