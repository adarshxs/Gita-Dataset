        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The three modes of material nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance, pertain to material intelligence and not to the spirit soul. By development of material goodness one can conquer the modes of passion and ignorance, and by cultivation of transcendental goodness one may free oneself even from material goodness.",
        "purport": " Goodness in the material world never exists in a pure form. Therefore, it is common knowledge that on the material platform no one is working without personal motivation. In the material world goodness is always mixed with some amount of passion and ignorance, whereas spiritual, or purified, goodness (vi\u015buddha-sattva) represents the liberated platform of perfection. Materially, one is proud to be an honest, compassionate man, but unless one is fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious one will speak truths that are not ultimately significant, and one will give mercy that is ultimately useless. Because the onward march of material time removes all situations and persons from the material stage, our so-called mercy and truth apply to situations that shortly will not exist. Real truth is eternal, and real mercy means to situate people in eternal truth. Still, for an ordinary person, cultivation of material goodness may be a preliminary stage on the road to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For example, it is stated in the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that one who is addicted to meat-eating cannot understand the pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By cultivation of the material mode of goodness, however, one may become a vegetarian and perhaps come to appreciate the sublime process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Since it is clearly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the material modes of nature constantly rotate, one must take advantage of an elevated position in material goodness to step onto the transcendental platform. Otherwise, as the wheel of time turns one will again go into the darkness of material ignorance."

        "purport": " Since the three modes of material nature are constantly in conflict, vying for supremacy, how is it possible that the mode of goodness can subdue the modes of passion and ignorance? Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here explains how one can be strongly fixed in the mode of goodness, which automatically gives rise to religious principles. In the Fourteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a elaborately explains the things that are in goodness, passion and ignorance. Thus, by choosing food, attitudes, work, recreation, etc., strictly in the mode of goodness, one will become situated in that mode. The usefulness of sattva-gu\u1e47a, or the mode of goodness, is that it produces religious principles aimed at and characterized by devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without such devotional service to the Lord, the mode of goodness is considered useless and merely another aspect of material illusion. The word v\u1e5bddh\u0101t, or \u201cstrengthened, increased,\u201d indicates clearly that one should come to the platform of vi\u015buddha-sattva, or purified goodness. The word v\u1e5bddh\u0101t indicates growth, and growth should not be stopped until full maturity is reached. The full maturity of goodness is called vi\u015buddha-sattva, or the transcendental platform on which there is no trace of any other quality. In pure goodness all knowledge automatically manifests, and one can easily understand one\u2019s eternal loving relationship with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the actual meaning and purpose of dharma, or religious principles. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya points out in this regard that an increase in the mode of goodness strengthens religious principles and the invigorated execution of religious principles strengthens the mode of goodness. In that way, one can advance higher and higher in the mode of spiritual happiness."

One should study religious scriptures that teach detachment from mental speculation and material sense gratification, not scriptures that provide rituals and mantras to increase material ignorance. Such materialistic scriptures do not give attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus are basically atheistic. One should accept pure water for quenching thirst and cleaning the body. There is no need for a devotee to use colognes, perfume, whiskey, beer, etc., which are all polluted manifestations of water. One should associate with persons who are cultivating detachment from the material world and not with those who are materially attached or sinful in their behavior. One should live in a solitary place where devotional service is practiced and discussed among Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. One should not be spontaneously attracted to busy highways, shopping centers, sports stadiums, and so on. Concerning time, one should rise by four o\u2019clock in the morning and utilize the auspicious br\u0101hma-muh\u016brta to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Similarly, one should avoid the sinful influence of hours such as midnight, when ghosts and demons are encouraged to become active. Concerning work, one should execute one\u2019s prescribed duties, follow the regulative principles of spiritual life and utilize all of one\u2019s energy for pious purposes. Time should not be wasted in frivolous or materialistic activities, of which there are now literally millions in modern society. One can cultivate birth in the mode of goodness by accepting the second birth of initiation from a bona fide spiritual master and learning to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. One should not accept initiation or so-called spiritual birth in unauthorized mystical or religious cults in the modes of passion and ignorance. One should meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the enjoyer of all sacrifices, and similarly, one should meditate on the lives of great devotees and saintly persons. One should not meditate on lusty women and envious men. Concerning mantras, one should follow the example of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and not other songs, verses, poetry or mantras that glorify the kingdom of illusion. Purificatory rituals should be performed to purify the spirit soul and not to bring down material blessings on one\u2019s material household. One who increases the mode of goodness will certainly become fixed in religious principles, and automatically knowledge will arise. As knowledge increases one is able to understand the eternal spirit soul and the Supreme Soul, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the soul becomes free from the artificial imposition of the gross and subtle material bodies caused by the modes of material nature. Spiritual knowledge burns to ashes the material designations that cover the living entity, and one\u2019s real, eternal life begins."

Thus, the fire is automatically calmed by its own action. Similarly, by the competition and interaction of the material modes of nature, the subtle and gross material bodies are generated. If one uses his mind and body to cultivate knowledge, then such enlightenment destroys the influence of the modes of nature that generated one\u2019s body. Thus, like the fire, the body and mind are pacified by their own actions in destroying the source of their birth.",
        "purport": " The word gu\u1e47a-vyatyaya-ja\u1e25 is significant in this verse. Vyatyaya indicates change or inversion in the normal order of things. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has described the concept of vyatyaya by giving the Sanskrit synonym vai\u1e63amya, which indicates inequality or disproportionate diversity. Thus, it is understood by the term gu\u1e47a-vyatyaya-ja\u1e25 that the body is generated by the unstable relationships of the three modes of material nature, which exist everywhere in constantly changing proportions. There is constant strife among the modes of nature. A good person is sometimes torn by passion, and a passionate person sometimes wants to give up everything and rest. An ignorant person may sometimes become disgusted with his depraved life, and a passionate person may sometimes indulge in bad habits in the mode of ignorance. Due to the interactive conflict of the modes of nature, one wanders throughout material nature creating one body after another by one\u2019s own work, karma. As it is said, variety is the mother of enjoyment, and the variety of material modes gives hope to the conditioned souls that by changing their material situation their unhappiness and frustration can be turned into happiness and satisfaction. But even if one acquires relative material happiness, that will soon be disturbed by the inevitable flux of the material modes."

        "purport": " The standard methods of enjoyment in the material world are sex, money and false prestige, all of which are obtained with great suffering and eventually lost. One engaged in material life suffers in the present and has only a very bleak future to look forward to in the continuing cycle of birth and death. Thus, how can human beings who have seen these things and know them very well continue to enjoy life like dogs, asses and goats? Often a dog will approach a bitch for sex, but the lady dog may not be attracted and will show her teeth, snarl and threaten the poor dog with serious injury. Still he goes about his business trying to get a little sex pleasure. Similarly, many times a dog risks being beaten or shot while stealing some food in a place where he knows he should not go. The ass is very attracted to the she-ass, but the lady ass often kicks him in the legs. Similarly, the ass\u2019s master gives the ass a handful of grass, which the poor ass could get anywhere, and then burdens him with great loads. The goat is generally raised for slaughter, and even when the goat is brought into the slaughterhouse he shamelessly goes after the lady goat to get sex pleasure. In this way, even at the risk of being shot, bitten, beaten and slaughtered, animals persist in their foolish sense gratification. How can an educated human being commit himself to such a condemned way of life, wherein the result is practically the same as that of the animals? If by cultivating the mode of goodness one\u2019s life is filled with happiness, enlightenment and future rewards, why would anyone cultivate the modes of passion and ignorance? This is Uddhava\u2019s question."

The process by which one is helplessly bound in illusion is clearly described here. A materialistic person is always thinking, \u201cOh, what a beautiful house. I wish we could buy it\u201d or \u201cWhat a beautiful woman. I wish I could touch her\u201d or \u201cWhat a powerful position. I wish I could occupy it\u201d and so on.

The mind is created from the mode of goodness, as described in S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, and the natural, peaceful situation of the mind is pure love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in which there is no mental disturbance, disappointment or confusion.

In the Ninth Chapter, verse 32, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a blessed Brahm\u0101 with realized knowledge of the Lord\u2019s actual form, qualities and activities. In the Ninth Chapter, verse 37, the Lord ordered Brahm\u0101 to rigidly carry out the Lord\u2019s injunctions and affirmed that Brahm\u0101 would thus never be bewildered in his cosmic decision-making. In the Sixth Chapter, verse 34, Lord Brahm\u0101 assured his son N\u0101rada, \u201cO N\u0101rada, because I have caught hold of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, with great zeal, whatever I say has never proved to have been false, nor is the progress of my mind ever deterred, nor are my senses ever degraded by temporary attachment to matter.\u201d In the present verse in this Thirteenth Chapter of the Eleventh Canto, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states that Brahm\u0101 unfortunately did become bewildered by his creative functions, thus providing a grave lesson to all of the Lord\u2019s empowered representatives. Although one may be elevated to an exalted position in the Lord\u2019s transcendental service, at any moment there is danger of false pride polluting one\u2019s devotional mentality."

Ultimately, what is the real situation or resting place both of yourselves and of Me?",
        "purport": " \u0100\u015braya means \u201cthe resting place\u201d or \u201cshelter.\u201d Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s question \u201cWhat is our actual resting place or shelter?\u201d means \u201cWhat is our ultimate nature or constitutional position?\u201d This is because no one can come to rest or be satisfied unless one is in one\u2019s natural position. The example is given that one may travel all over the world, but ultimately one becomes satisfied by returning to one\u2019s own home. Similarly, a crying child is satisfied when embraced by its own mother. By inquiring about the shelter or resting place of Himself and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the Lord is indicating the eternal, constitutional position of every living entity. If Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were also in the j\u012bva category, and if all living entities including Him were thus equal, there would be no deep purpose in one living entity inquiring and another answering. Only one who is in a superior position can meaningfully answer important questions. It may be argued that the bona fide spiritual master answers all the questions of the disciple, and yet the guru is in the j\u012bva category. The answer is that the bona fide spiritual master speaks not on his own behalf but as a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u category. A so-called guru speaking on his own behalf as a j\u012bva soul is useless and is unable to meaningfully answer serious questions. Thus, the sages\u2019 question ko bhav\u0101n (\u201cWho are You?\u201d) indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally an individual person. And because the sages headed by Lord Brahm\u0101 offered obeisances and worshiped the Lord, it is understood that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Brahm\u0101, as the first created being in this universe, could not accept any other living entity except the Lord as worshipable. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s actual purpose is to explain the ultimate perfection of yoga, which the sages were desiring to know. If one becomes fixed in transcendental knowledge, the mutual attraction between the material mind and the material sense objects automatically ceases. The spiritual mind is not attracted to material objects of gratification, and thus by spiritualizing the mind, material existence automatically slackens. By questioning the propriety of the sages\u2019 question, the Lord is assuming the position of the spiritual master and preparing to give valuable instructions. One should never be envious of a bona fide spiritual master, especially if, as in the case of Lord Ha\u1e41sa speaking to the sages headed by Brahm\u0101 and Sanaka-kum\u0101ra, the guru is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself."

Thus, it appears that in asking My identity, you are merely speaking words, without any real meaning or purpose.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains this verse as follows. \u201cIn the previous verse Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a demonstrated that if the sages accepted the impersonal philosophy that all living beings are ultimately one in all respects, their question \u2018Who are You?\u2019 was meaningless, since there would be no philosophical basis to distinguish one manifestation of spirit soul from another. In this verse the Lord refutes the false identification with the material body composed of five elements. If the sages accepted the body as the self, then their question was meaningless, since they would have to ask, \u2018Who are you five?\u2019 If the sages replied that although the body is composed basically of five elements and these elements can be considered a single substance in the form of the whole body, then the Lord has already replied by the words sam\u0101ne\u1e63u ca vastuta\u1e25. The bodies of human beings, demigods, animals, etc., are all composed of the same five elements and are essentially the same. Therefore the question \u2018Who are You?\u2019 is ultimately meaningless. Thus, if one accepts either the theory that all living entities are ultimately the same or the theory that all living entities are ultimately nondifferent from their material bodies, in both cases the question of the sages is meaningless. \u201cThe sages might argue that even among learned persons it is common practice to ask questions and give answers on many subjects as a part of normal life. The sages could point out that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also distinguished among them, by His saying vipr\u0101\u1e25,\u00a0\u2018O br\u0101hma\u1e47as,\u2019 and va\u1e25, or \u2018your [question],\u2019 as expressed in this verse. In this way it is seen that the Lord also accepts the ordinary customs of questions and answers. To answer this argument, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states, v\u0101c\u0101rambho hy anarthaka\u1e25. The Lord states, \u2018My addressing you as br\u0101hma\u1e47as is merely an exhibition of words if we are ultimately not different. I merely reciprocated with your approach to Me. Therefore, if we are ultimately one, neither My statement nor your question has any real meaning. I can conclude therefore by your question to Me that you are all not actually very intelligent. Therefore, why are you inquiring after ultimate knowledge? Aren\u2019t you all embarrassed?\u2019\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya points out in this regard that the question of the sages was not appropriate, since they had already seen their father, Lord Brahm\u0101, worshiping the lotus feet of Lord Ha\u1e41sa. Since their spiritual master and father was worshiping Lord Ha\u1e41sa, they should have immediately understood the Lord\u2019s position, and their question is thus meaningless."

Now the Lord refutes the conception that He is a Supreme God far beyond and different from everything within this world. Modern agnostic philosophers preach that God created the world and then retired or went away. According to them, God has no tangible connection with this world, nor does He interfere in human affairs. Ultimately, they claim, God is so great that He cannot be known; therefore no one should waste time trying to understand God. To refute such foolish ideas, the Lord here explains that since everything is the expansion of His potency, He is not different from anything. Nothing can exist separately from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus everything shares in the Lord\u2019s nature, although some manifestations are superior and others inferior. The Lord is testing the intelligence of the sages by pointing out various contradictions in their questions. Even if the Lord is supreme, He is not different from His creation; therefore, what is the meaning of the question \u201cWho are You?\u201d We can clearly see that the Lord is paving the way for a deep discussion of spiritual knowledge."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the form of Ha\u1e41sa-avat\u0101ra, on the pretext of finding contradictions in the simple inquiry of the sons of Brahm\u0101 (\u201cWho are You?\u201d), is actually preparing to teach the sages perfect spiritual knowledge, but only after first rejecting two false concepts of life, namely that all living entities are the same in all respects and that the living entity is identical with his outward or subtle body. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a now answers the difficult question that puzzled even Lord Brahm\u0101. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the sons of Lord Brahm\u0101 were thinking as follows. \u201cOur dear Lord, if it is indeed true that we are unintelligent, still Your Lordship has stated that You are actually everything because everything is the expansion of Your potency. Therefore, You are also the mind and the sense objects, which are the subject matter of our question. The material sense objects always enter into the functions of the mind, and similarly, the mind always enters into the material sense objects. Thus, it is proper that we inquire from Your Lordship about the process by which the sense objects will no longer enter the mind and the mind will no longer enter the sense objects. Please be merciful and give us the answer.\u201d The Lord answers as follows. \u201cMy dear sons, it is a fact that the mind enters into the material sense objects and the sense objects into the mind. Thus, although the living entity is actually part and parcel of Me, being, as I am also, eternally conscious, and although the eternal form of the living entity is spiritual, in conditioned life the living entity artificially imposes upon himself the mind and sense objects, which act as covering designations of the eternal soul. Since it is the natural function of the material mind and sense objects to mutually interact, how can you possibly endeavor to prevent such a mutual attraction? Since both the material mind and sense objects are useless, they both should be completely given up, and thus automatically you will be free from all material duality.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b points out that the symptom of the material mind is the tendency to consider oneself to be the ultimate doer and enjoyer. Naturally, one with such a puffed-up mentality is helplessly attracted by the sense objects. One who considers himself to be the doer and enjoyer will be irresistibly attracted to the means for attaining sense gratification and false prestige, namely, exploitation of material objects. Above the material mind, however, is intelligence, which can perceive the existence of the eternal spirit soul. It is not possible to separate the material mind from the sense objects, because they naturally exist together. Therefore, by intelligence, one must realize one\u2019s eternal form as spirit soul, part and parcel of the Lord, and completely reject the bogus material mentality. One who revives his original spiritual mentality becomes automatically detached from material attraction. Therefore, one should cultivate knowledge of the falsity of sense gratification. When the mind or senses are attracted to material enjoyment, the superior intelligence must immediately detect such illusion. In this way, one should purify one\u2019s mentality. By devotional service to the Lord, such detachment and intelligence automatically awaken, and by full understanding of one\u2019s original spiritual form, one is properly situated in eternal consciousness."

        "purport": " The Lord again states here that it is most difficult to separate the material mind from its objects because the material mind by definition considers itself to be the doer and enjoyer of everything. It must be understood that giving up the material mind does not mean giving up all mental activities, but instead means purifying the mind and engaging one\u2019s enlightened mentality in the devotional service of the Lord. Since time immemorial the material mind and senses have been in contact with the sense objects; therefore, how is it possible for the material mind to give up its objects, which are the basis of its existence? And not only does the mind reach out to material objects, but also, because of the mind\u2019s desires, the material objects cannot remain out of the mind, helplessly entering at every moment. Thus, separation between the mind and sense objects is not actually feasible, nor does it serve any purpose. If one retains a material mentality, considering oneself to be supreme, one may renounce sense gratification, considering it to be ultimately the cause of unhappiness, but one will not be able to remain on such an artificial platform, nor will such renunciation serve any real purpose. Without surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, mere renunciation cannot take one out of this material world. Just as the sun\u2019s rays are part of the sun, the living entities are part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the living entity is completely absorbed in his identity as the part and parcel of the Personality of Godhead, he becomes actually wise and easily gives up the material mind and sense objects. The word mad-r\u016bpa\u1e25 in this verse indicates absorption of the mind in the form, qualities, pastimes and associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Immersed in such ecstatic meditation, one should render devotional service to the Lord, and this will automatically drive away the influence of sense gratification. By himself, the living entity does not have the potency to give up his false identification with the material mind and sense objects, but by worshiping the Lord in the mood of being His eternal part-and-parcel servant, one is infused with the Lord\u2019s potency, which easily drives away the darkness of ignorance."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments as follows: \u201cAlthough Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His form of Ha\u1e41sa-avat\u0101ra has condemned the intelligence that sees duality and separate values within the material world, the Vedas themselves institute the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, by which the entire human society is divided into different castes, occupations and spiritual statuses. Therefore, how can the Lord recommend that one give up one\u2019s faith in this Vedic system? The answer is given in this verse as follows. The words anye\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 bh\u0101v\u0101n\u0101m, or \u2018of other states of existence,\u2019 refer to the innumerable divisions of false identification with the material body, mind, occupation, and so on. Such identification is illusion, and the material divisions of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system are certainly based on this illusion. The Vedic literatures promise heavenly rewards such as residence in upper planetary systems and prescribe the means to acquire such rewards. However, both the rewards and the means for achieving them are ultimately illusion. Since this world is the Lord\u2019s creation, one cannot deny that its existence is also real; yet the living entity who identifies the creations of this world as belonging to himself is certainly in illusion. The example may be given that horns are real and rabbits are real, but if one imagines a rabbit\u2019s horns, that is certainly illusion, though a rabbit\u2019s horns may occur in a dream. Similarly, the living entity dreams of a permanent relationship within the material world. One may dream that one is feasting on sumptuous sweet rice prepared with milk and sugar, but there is no actual nutritional value in the dream of royal feasting.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks in this regard that just as one soon forgets the experience of a dream after awakening, similarly, a liberated soul in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not see anything substantial in even the most exalted rewards offered by the Vedas, such as promotion to the heavenly planets. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advised Arjuna in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to remain fixed in self-realization, without being deviated by fruitive rituals performed in the name of religion."

One may first consider the three phases of consciousness mentioned above and then understand one\u2019s own transcendental position as spirit soul. One experiences childhood, boyhood, adolescence, adulthood, middle age and old age, and throughout these phases one is experiencing things while awake and while dreaming. Similarly, one may, by careful intelligence, understand one\u2019s lack of consciousness during deep sleep, and thus through intelligence one may have experience of lack of consciousness. One may argue that it is actually the senses that experience during wakefulness and that it is the mind that experiences during dreams. However, the Lord here states, indriye\u015ba\u1e25: the living entity is actually the lord of the senses and mind, although temporarily he has become a victim of their influence. By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one may resume one\u2019s rightful position as master of the mental and sensory faculties. Also, since the living entity can remember his experiences in these three stages of consciousness, he is ultimately the experiencing agent or the seer of all phases of consciousness. He remembers, \u201cI saw so many things in my dream, and then my dream ended and I didn\u2019t see anything. Now I\u2019m waking up.\u201d This universal experience can be understood by everyone, and thus everyone can understand that one\u2019s actual identity is separate from the material body and mind."

They can be compared to the streaking red line created by whirling a fiery stick. The spirit soul by nature exists in the single state of pure consciousness. However, in this world he appears in many different forms and stages of existence. The modes of nature divide the soul\u2019s consciousness into normal wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep. All such varieties of perception, however, are actually m\u0101y\u0101 and exist only like a dream.",

L\u0101sa means \u201cjumping\u201d or \u201cdancing,\u201d and thus manaso vil\u0101sam here indicates that the material mind is jumping superficially from one conception of life to another. Our original consciousness, however, is one (vij\u00f1\u0101nam ekam). Therefore, one should carefully study the flickering \u201chere today, gone tomorrow\u201d nature of the material world and detach oneself from the illusory variety of m\u0101y\u0101."

Therefore, they may have doubted the instructions they had just received from Lord Ha\u1e41sa. Anticipating any such reluctance, the Lord immediately clarifies the situation in the present verse. The Lord explains that, unlike ordinary living entities even up to the standard of Brahm\u0101, the Lord\u2019s transcendental body is not different from His eternal Self and has no material qualities such as false egotism. The Lord\u2019s transcendental form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss, and is thus nirgu\u1e47am, beyond the modes of nature. Because the Lord completely ignores the so-called enjoyment offered by the illusory energy, He is called nirapek\u1e63akam, and being the best well-wisher of His devotees, He is called suh\u1e5bdam. Priyam indicates that the Lord is the supreme lovable object and that He establishes wonderful affectionate relationships with His devotees. S\u0101mya indicates that the Lord is neutral and detached in all material situations. These and other exalted qualities find their shelter and worshipable object in the Lord, who does not take material designations into consideration but awards His mercy to anyone who takes shelter of Him. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.16.26-30) mother Bh\u016bmi, the predominating deity of the earth, gives a list of some of the Lord\u2019s transcendental qualities, and even more are found in The Nectar of Devotion. Actually, the Lord\u2019s qualities are unlimited, but a small sample is given here simply to establish the Lord\u2019s transcendental position. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted from the K\u0101la-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as follows. \u201cThe demigods are not actually perfectly endowed with transcendental qualities. Indeed, their opulences are limited, and therefore they worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, who is simultaneously free of all material qualities and completely endowed with all transcendental qualities, which exist in His personal body.\u201d"
