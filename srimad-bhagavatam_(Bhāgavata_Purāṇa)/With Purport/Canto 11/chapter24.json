        "purport": " In the previous chapter the Lord explained that one can give up material duality by controlling the mind and fixing it in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This chapter describes the S\u0101\u1e45khya system, in which the difference between matter and spirit is elaborately explained. By hearing this knowledge one can easily separate the mind from material contamination and fix it on the spiritual platform in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy system mentioned here is that presented by Lord Kapila in the Third Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and not the atheistic S\u0101\u1e45khya presented later by materialists and M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs. The material elements, which emanate from the potency of the Lord, evolve in a progressive sequence. One should not foolishly think that such evolution begins from an original material element without the assistance of the Lord. This speculative theory is generated from the false ego of conditioned life and constitutes gross ignorance, unacceptable to the Personality of Godhead and His followers."

In modern society, knowledge is highly speculative and constantly changing. There is often a vast difference between people\u2019s theoretical ideas and actual reality. In Satya-yuga, however, people are viveka-nipu\u1e47\u0101\u1e25, or expert in intelligent discrimination, and thus there is no difference between their vision and reality. In Satya-yuga, the population in general is self-realized. Seeing everything as the potency of the Supreme Lord, they do not artificially create duality between themselves and other living entities. This is a further aspect of the oneness of Satya-yuga. At the time of annihilation, everything merges to rest within the Lord, and at that time also there is no difference between the Lord, who becomes the only seer, and the objects of knowledge, which are contained within the Lord. The liberated living entities in the eternal spiritual world are never subject to such merging but remain forever undisturbed in their spiritual forms. Because they are voluntarily one with the Lord in love, their abode is never annihilated."

The modes of nature arise after the glance of the Lord and become inimical to one another, each mode attempting to conquer the other two. There is constant competition between birth, maintenance and annihilation. Although a child desires to take birth, the cruel mother may desire to kill the child through abortion. Although we may desire to kill the weeds in a field, they stubbornly take birth again and again. Similarly, we often desire to maintain our physical status quo, but still deterioration sets in. Thus there is constant competition among the modes of nature, and by their combinations and permutations the living entities try to enjoy innumerable material situations without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The word puru\u1e63\u0101numatena indicates that the Lord sets the stage for such material futility so that the conditioned souls will eventually come back home, back to Godhead."

The false ego is the illusory combination of the eternal conscious soul and the temporary unconscious body. Because the spirit soul desires to exploit illicitly the creation of God, he is bewildered by the three modes of nature and assumes an illusory identity within the material world. Struggling to enjoy, he becomes more and more entangled in the complexities of illusion and only increases his anxiety. This hopeless situation can be overcome by taking to pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in which the pleasure of the Supreme Lord becomes the only goal of one\u2019s life."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b explains that the word tapasa\u1e25 in this verse refers to austerities performed by brahmac\u0101r\u012bs and v\u0101naprasthas. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b who practices celibacy perfectly in some particular stage of his life achieves Maharloka, and one who perfectly practices lifelong celibacy achieves Janoloka. By perfect execution of v\u0101naprastha one may achieve Tapoloka, and one in the renounced order of life goes to Satyaloka. These different destinations certainly depend on one\u2019s seriousness in the yoga system. In the Third Canto of the Bh\u0101gavatam, Lord Brahm\u0101 explains to the demigods, \u201cThe inhabitants of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha travel in their airplanes made of lapis lazuli, emeralds and gold. Although crowded by their consorts, who have large hips and beautiful smiling faces, they cannot be stimulated to passion by their mirth and beautiful charms.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.15.20) Thus in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God, the inhabitants have absolutely no desire for personal satisfaction, since they are completely satisfied in love of Godhead. Because they only think of the Lord\u2019s pleasure, there is no possibility of cheating, anxiety, lust, disappointment, and so on. As described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.62): \u201cO scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly. By His grace you will attain transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode.\u201d"

When the pot is destroyed, it will again assume the designation clay and ultimately merge back into the earth, its original cause. In relation to the clay pot, clay is the beginning and final state; thus the pot is called real, for it possesses the essential characteristics of clay, which exists before and after the existence of the functioning instrument known as the pot. Similarly, earth exists before and after the clay, and thus clay may be considered real because it possesses the essential characteristics of earth, which exists before and after the existence of the clay. Similarly, earth and other elements are created from the mahat-tattva, which exists before and after the existence of the elements, which may be considered real because they possess the essential characteristics of the mahat-tattva. The mahat-tattva is ultimately the creation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, who exists after all is annihilated.

Form merges into touch, and touch merges into ether. Ether finally merges into the sensation of sound. The senses all merge into their own origins, the presiding demigods, and they, O gentle Uddhava, merge into the controlling mind, which itself merges into false ego in the mode of goodness. Sound becomes one with false ego in the mode of ignorance, and all-powerful false ego, the first of all the physical elements, merges into the total nature. The total material nature, the primary repository of the three basic modes, dissolves into the modes. These modes of nature then merge into the unmanifest form of nature, and that unmanifest form merges into time. Time merges into the Supreme Lord, present in the form of the omniscient Mah\u0101-puru\u1e63a, the original activator of all living beings.

But a person who takes shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can see everything with clear intelligence. One who understands how the Supreme Lord creates and annihilates can be liberated from material bondage and devote himself to the eternal service of the Supreme Lord."
