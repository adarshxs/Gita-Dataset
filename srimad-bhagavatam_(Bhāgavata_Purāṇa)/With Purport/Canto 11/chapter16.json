Uddhava here addresses the Lord as the paramam, or supreme brahma, because in His feature as Bhagav\u0101n the Lord is the highest feature of the Absolute Truth and the shelter of unlimited spiritual opulences. Unlike those of ordinary living entities, the Lord\u2019s opulences cannot be restricted by time, and thus the Lord is an\u0101dy-antam, without beginning or end, and ap\u0101v\u1e5btam, unhindered by any superior or equal potency. The opulence of the material world is also resting within the Lord, who alone can protect, maintain, create and destroy the material world. In this chapter, \u015ar\u012b Uddhava inquires from the Lord about His spiritual and material opulences in order to refine his appreciation of the Lord\u2019s position as the Absolute Truth. Even Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the ultimate creator of the material world, is an expansion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus \u015ar\u012b Uddhava wishes to fully appreciate the unique status of his personal friend."

For example, in worshiping the Deity, the devotees will select the nicest flowers, fruits and ornaments for decorating the transcendental form of the Lord. Similarly, although the Lord is present in the heart of every conditioned soul, the devotee will give more attention to a conditioned soul interested in the message of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although the Lord is everywhere, the devotees make distinctions, for the sake of the Lord\u2019s service, between His presence in superior (ucca) and inferior (avace\u1e63u) creations."

Praying to God for specific material benedictions and assuming God\u2019s creation to be their personal property, the nondevotees cannot understand the actual form of the Lord. They therefore remain foolish and bewildered. Within the universe everything is subject to creation, maintenance and destruction, and thus the Supersoul is the only actual controller in the material world. Unfortunately, when the Supersoul appears in various incarnations to clarify His position, ignorant persons think that the Supersoul is merely another creation of the modes of material nature. As stated in this verse, they cannot see that person who is actually seeing them, and simply remain bewildered."

The Lord gave a similar explanation to Arjuna in the Tenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.20), beginning with the same words, aham \u0101tm\u0101. Although the Lord describes His external, or material, opulences, the Lord\u2019s position is always transcendental and nonmaterial.

Thus the Lord Himself is the basis of the mundane process of philosophical speculation, for He creates differing and alternating modes of perception within the conditioned souls. It is to be understood that one can acquire perfect knowledge only by hearing directly from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not by hearing from conditioned philosophers who imperfectly perceive the creation of the Lord through the screen of their personal desires."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the entire basis of the existence of both the living entity and matter. Nothing can possibly exist even for a moment without the mercy of the Supreme Lord. One should not foolishly conclude that the Lord is therefore material. As has been clearly explained in this canto of the Bh\u0101gavatam, both the living entity and the Supreme Lord are completely transcendental to material nature. The living entity, however, has the propensity to dream that he is material, whereas the Lord constantly remembers the transcendental position of both Himself and the conditioned dreaming entity. As the Lord is transcendental, His abode is also far beyond the reach of the modes of nature. The actual purpose of life is to understand by mature conviction the transcendental Lord, His transcendental abode, our own transcendental position and the process by which we may go back home, back to Godhead."

        "translation": "I have briefly described to you all My spiritual opulences and also the extraordinary material features of My creation, which are perceived by the mind and defined in different ways according to circumstances.",
        "purport": " According to Sanskrit grammar, and as confirmed by \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the words et\u0101\u1e25 and ete describe two distinct sets of the Lord\u2019s opulences. The Lord has described His opulent plenary expansions, such as V\u0101sudeva, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supersoul, etc., and further the Lord has described the outstanding features of the material creation, which are also included among the glories of the Personality of Godhead. The plenary manifestations of the Lord, such as V\u0101sudeva, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, etc., are all eternal, unchanging transcendental features of the Lord and are indicated by the term et\u0101\u1e25. The extraordinary aspects of material creation, however, are circumstantial and dependent on individual perception, and they are therefore described here by the words mano-vik\u0101r\u0101 evaite yath\u0101 v\u0101c\u0101bhidh\u012byate. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b explains that by consistent logical application of synonyms, et\u0101\u1e25 refers to the Lord\u2019s eternal spiritual manifestations, beyond the perception of the material senses, whereas ete refers to those opulences that can be perceived by conditioned souls. He gives the example that the paraphernalia and intimate associates of a king are all considered to be part and parcel of the king and are therefore granted royal status. Similarly, the opulent features of material creation are reflected expansions of the Lord\u2019s personal opulences and thus may be considered nondifferent from Him. One should not, however, wrongly assume that such insignificant material opulences occupy the same status as the Lord\u2019s plenary features as the Personality of Godhead, which are qualitatively and quantitatively equal to the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments as follows on this verse. \u201cThe Lord\u2019s external opulences are called mano-vik\u0101r\u0101\u1e25, or \u2018related to mental transformation,\u2019 because ordinary people perceive extraordinary features of the material world according to their personal state of mind. Thus the word v\u0101c\u0101bhidh\u012byate indicates that conditioned souls describe the Lord\u2019s material creation according to specific material circumstances. Because of the circumstantial relative definitions of material opulence, such opulence is never to be considered a direct plenary manifestation of the Lord\u2019s personal form. When one\u2019s state of mind is transformed into a favorable or affectionate state, one defines a manifestation of the Lord\u2019s energy as \u2018my son,\u2019 \u2018my father,\u2019 \u2018my husband,\u2019 \u2018my uncle,\u2019 \u2018the son of my brother,\u2019 \u2018my friend,\u2019 and so on. One forgets that every living entity is actually part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that whatever opulences, talents or outstanding features one may exhibit are actually the potencies of the Lord. Similarly, when the mind is transformed into a negative or inimical state, one thinks, \u2018This person will be the ruin of me,\u2019 \u2018This person must be finished by me,\u2019 \u2018He is my enemy\u2019 or \u2018I am his enemy,\u2019 \u2018He is a killer\u2019 or \u2018He should be killed.\u2019 The negative state of mind is also expressed when one is attracted to the extraordinary material aspects of particular persons or objects but forgets that they are manifestations of the potency of the Personality of Godhead. Even the demigod Indra, who is quite obviously a manifestation of the Lord\u2019s material opulences, is misunderstood by others. For example, Indra\u2019s wife, \u015aac\u012b, thinks that Indra is \u2018my husband,\u2019 whereas Aditi thinks that he is \u2018my son.\u2019 Jayanta thinks that he is \u2018my father,\u2019 B\u1e5bhaspati thinks that he is \u2018my disciple,\u2019 whereas the demons feel that Indra is their personal enemy. Thus different personalities define him according to their mental state. The Lord\u2019s material opulences, being relatively perceived, are therefore called mano-vik\u0101ra, which means they are dependent on mental states. This relative perception is material because it does not recognize the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the actual source of the particular opulence. If one sees Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the source of all opulences and gives up all desires to enjoy or possess the Lord\u2019s opulences, then one can see the spiritual nature of these opulences. At that time, even though one may continue to perceive the variety and distinctions of the material world, one will become perfect in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should not conclude, as do the voidist philosophers, that the Lord\u2019s spiritual manifestations in the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva and liberated j\u012bva categories are also products of relative perception and mental states. This useless idea is contrary to the entire body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s teachings to \u015ar\u012b Uddhava.\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the word v\u0101c\u0101 also indicates the various Vedic literatures that describe the particular processes by which the Lord manifests His spiritual and material opulences, and in this context yath\u0101 indicates the specific procedures of manifestation and creation."

A self-realized devotee tolerates personal insult and does not become envious of any living entity, nor does he see anyone as his enemy. This is practical enlightenment. Although a pure devotee may criticize those who obstruct the Lord\u2019s mission, such criticism is never personally motivated nor is it ever based on enviousness. An advanced devotee of the Lord may chastise his followers or criticize the demoniac, but only to carry out the mission of the Supreme Lord and never out of personal enmity or enviousness. For one who completely gives up the material concept of life there is no possibility of entering again onto the path of birth and death."
