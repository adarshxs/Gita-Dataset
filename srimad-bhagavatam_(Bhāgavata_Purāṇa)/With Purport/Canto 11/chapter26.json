The material body is a polluted material form heading toward a lowly destination, yet when a man stares at the face of a woman he thinks, \u201cWhat a good-looking lady! What a charming nose she\u2019s got, and see her beautiful smile!\u201d",
        "purport": " The phrase tuccha-ni\u1e63\u1e6dhe, or \u201cheaded toward a lowly destination,\u201d indicates that if buried, the body will be consumed by worms; if burned, it will turn to ashes; and if dying in a lonely place, it will be consumed by dogs and vultures. The illusory potency of M\u0101y\u0101 enters within the female form and bewilders a man\u2019s mind. The man is attracted to M\u0101y\u0101 appearing within the female form, but when he embraces the woman\u2019s body he ends up with two handfuls of stool, blood, mucus, pus, skin, bone, hairs and flesh. People should not be like cats and dogs, in the ignorance of bodily consciousness. A human being should be enlightened in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and learn to serve the Supreme Lord without falsely trying to exploit His potencies."
