        "translation": "Uddhava inquired: My dear Lord, O master of the universe, how many different elements of creation have been enumerated by the great sages? I have heard You personally describe a total of twenty-eight \u2014 God, the j\u012bva soul, the mahat-tattva, false ego, the five gross elements, the ten senses, the mind, the five subtle objects of perception and the three modes of nature. But some authorities say that there are twenty-six elements, while others cite twenty-five or else seven, nine, six, four or eleven, and even others say that there are seventeen, sixteen or thirteen. What did each of these sages have in mind when he calculated the creative elements in such different ways? O supreme eternal, kindly explain this to me.",
        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thoroughly explained in the previous chapter that Vedic knowledge is not meant for sense gratification but for liberation from material bondage. Now Uddhava presents some intermediate questions that must be answered so the path of liberation will be clear. Different philosophers have historically disagreed over the exact number of material elements, about the existence and nonexistence of particular external objects and about the existence of the soul itself. The j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas aims at liberation through analytic understanding of the material world and of the spirit soul as a transcendental element beyond matter. Ultimately the Supreme Lord Himself stands above all elements and maintains them by His personal potency. Uddhava mentions in numerical terms different methodologies of various sages, citing first the Lord\u2019s own opinion. The word \u0101yu\u1e63man, or \u201cpossessing eternal form,\u201d is significant in this regard. Since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is eternal, He possesses all knowledge of past, present and future and is thus the original and supreme philosopher. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the different analytic approaches mentioned by \u015ar\u012b Uddhava are actually not contradictory, since they are different methods of categorizing the same reality. Atheistic speculation on reality does not recognize the existence of God; consequently it is a worthless attempt to explain the truth. The Lord Himself empowers different living entities to speculate and speak on reality in different ways. The actual reality, however, is the Lord Himself, who will now speak to \u015ar\u012b Uddhava."

All such philosophers spoke under the shelter of My mystic potency, and thus they could say anything without contradicting the truth.",
        "purport": " The words santi sarvatra in this verse indicate that all material elements are found within each other in gross and subtle forms. In this way there are innumerable ways to categorically describe them. The material world is ultimately illusory, undergoing constant transformation. It may be measured in different ways, just as the mirage of an oasis may be described in different ways, but the Lord\u2019s own analysis of twenty-eight elements is perfect and should be accepted. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b states that the word m\u0101y\u0101 in this verse does not refer to mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, or the potency of ignorance, but to the Lord\u2019s inconceivable mystic power, which shelters the learned followers of Vedic knowledge. Each of the philosophers mentioned here reveals a particular aspect of truth, and their theories are not contradictory, since they are simply describing the same phenomena with different categorical systems. Such philosophical disagreement is endless within the material world; thus everyone should unite on the platform of the Lord\u2019s own opinion, as stated in this verse. Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a requests all conditioned souls to give up their various forms of worship and surrender unto Him in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, becoming His devotees. Thus the whole universe can be united in love of Godhead by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. By the Lord\u2019s revealing Himself to a sincere devotee, the controversy of analytic philosophy is ended."

Such unity of opinion is not based on the absence of philosophical inquiry, nor on the stifling of rational discussion, but is the natural result of spiritual enlightenment. So-called philosophers proudly boast that they are searching and researching for the Absolute Truth, yet they somehow consider one who has found the Absolute Truth to be less intelligent than one who has not found it but is searching. Because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Absolute Truth, one who fully surrenders to the Lord becomes the most learned person."

        "purport": " Although the Lord tolerates different methods of calculating material causes within their effects and material effects within their causes, there cannot be any speculation regarding the two spiritual elements found in this universe, namely the individual soul and the Supersoul. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly states in this verse that the living entity is incapable of effecting his own enlightenment. The Supreme Lord is tattva-j\u00f1a, omniscient, and j\u00f1\u0101na-da, the spiritual master of the entire universe. \u015ar\u012b Uddhava mentioned that some philosophers describe twenty-five elements and others twenty-six. The difference is that the twenty-six elements include a separate category for the individual soul and the Supreme Soul, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas the proponents of twenty-five elements artificially merge the two transcendental categories of j\u012bva-tattva and vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, hiding the eternal supremacy of the Personality of Godhead. Knowledge based on the three modes of material nature cannot rise to the transcendental platform, where the Personality of Godhead exists as the supreme enjoyer of eternal spiritual varieties of form, color, flavor, musical sounds and loving affairs. Mundane philosophers simply bounce back and forth between material enjoyment and material renunciation. Being victims of M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da (impersonal) perception of the Absolute Truth, they cannot achieve the shelter of the Personality of Godhead and thus cannot understand Him. Because foolish, impersonal philosophers consider themselves supreme, they are unable to appreciate that loving service exists on the spiritual platform. Stubbornly rejecting subservience to the Personality of Godhead, the impersonalists are eventually overwhelmed by the illusory potency of the Lord and undergo the miseries of material existence. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, on the other hand, are not envious of the Personality of Godhead. They gladly accept His shelter and supremacy, and thus the Lord personally takes charge of His devotees and enlightens them, filling them with His own transcendental bliss. Spiritual service to the Supreme Lord is in this way free from the disappointment and repression of material service."

Such impersonal knowledge is declared by the Lord to be material: j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 ca prak\u1e5bter gu\u1e47a\u1e25. Such knowledge can, however, be accepted to establish the qualitative identity of the Supreme Lord and the living entities who expand from Him. Materialistic persons sometimes believe that there is a supreme spirit in heaven but also think that human beings are identical with their material bodies and thus qualitatively and perpetually separated from the Supreme Lord. Knowledge of the Lord\u2019s qualitative oneness with the living entity, as described in this verse, refutes the materialistic concept of life and partially establishes the Absolute Truth. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu described the actual situation as acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva: the supreme controller and the controlled living entities are simultaneously one and different. In the material mode of goodness the oneness is perceived. As one proceeds further, to the stage of vi\u015buddha-sattva, or purified spiritual goodness, one finds spiritual variety within the qualitative oneness, completing one\u2019s knowledge of the Absolute Truth. The words na vailak\u1e63a\u1e47yam a\u1e47v api boldly affirm that the individual living entity is indisputably part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and qualitatively one with Him. Any philosophical attempt to separate the living entity from the Supreme Lord and deny his eternal servitude to the Lord is thus refuted. Speculation arriving at the conclusion that the living entity has independent existence separate from the Lord is described here as ap\u0101rth\u0101, useless. Nevertheless, the theory of twenty-five elements is acceptable to the Lord as a preliminary phase in the evolution of spiritual knowledge."

The living entity thus cannot be accepted as the actual doer or creator within the material world. The mode of goodness is symptomized by the experience of knowledge, the mode of passion by the experience of work, and the mode of ignorance by the experience of darkness. These modes of material knowledge, work and darkness have no real relation with the transcendental spirit soul, who exhibits his own qualities of eternality, bliss and knowledge (the sandhin\u012b, sa\u1e41vit and hl\u0101din\u012b potencies of the Supreme Lord). The material modes have no access within the kingdom of God, in the unbounded atmosphere of which the eternal living entity is meant to live."

Although the Vedic scriptures declare that the material body is a temporary fabrication of the material modes of nature, the conscious living entity within the body is actually an eternal spirit soul. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has declared the material elements constituting the body to be His separated, inferior energy, whereas the living entity is the superior, conscious energy of the Lord. Still, in conditioned life the material body and conditioned soul appear inseparable and thus nondifferent. Because the living entity enters the womb of a mother and gradually comes out in a developed body, the soul appears to have entered deeply within material nature. Similarly, by the soul\u2019s identification with the material body, the body appears to enter deeply within the consciousness of the soul. What is more, the body cannot exist without the presence of the soul. By this apparent mutual dependence, the difference between the body and soul is obscured. \u015ar\u012b Uddhava therefore questions the Lord in order to clarify this issue."

        "translation": "Sight, visible form and the reflected image of the sun within the aperture of the eye all work together to reveal one another. But the original sun standing in the sky is self-manifested. Similarly, the Supreme Soul, the original cause of all entities, who is thus separate from all of them, acts by the illumination of His own transcendental experience as the ultimate source of manifestation of all mutually manifesting objects.",
        "purport": " Form is recognized by the function of the eye, and the eye\u2019s function is understood by the presence of perceivable form. This interaction of sight and form further depends on the presence of light provided by the demigods, whose service of universal management depends on the presence of those who are to be managed, namely the living entities experiencing form with their eyes. Thus the three factors \u2014 adhy\u0101tma, represented by the senses such as the eye; adhibh\u016bta, the sense objects such as form; and adhidaiva, the influence of the controlling deities \u2014 exist in an interdependent relationship. The sun globe itself is said to be self-manifest, self-luminous and self-experiencing; it does not share the interdependence of the senses and sense objects although facilitating their function. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead facilitates the interdependent experiences of all living entities. For example, newspapers, radio and television reveal world events to the mass of people. Parents reveal facts about life to their children, teachers to their students, friends to friends, and so on. The government manifests its will to the people and the people to their government. The sun and moon reveal the visual forms of all objects, and the perception of sound reveals audible form. The vibrations of particular types of music or rhetoric reveal the inner feelings of other living beings, and other types of knowledge are revealed by aroma, touch and taste. In this way, through the interaction of the senses and mind with innumerable sense objects, different types of knowledge are acquired. All such informative interactions, however, depend upon the supreme illuminating power of the Personality of Godhead. As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.52), yac-cak\u1e63ur e\u1e63a savit\u0101 sakala-grah\u0101\u1e47\u0101m: \u201cAmong all the planets the sun is considered the eye of the Supreme Lord.\u201d The Personality of Godhead is eternally omniscient by His own transcendental potency, and thus no one can reveal anything to the Lord about anything. Still, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a humbly accepts our prayers offered in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In conclusion, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly explains here that His sublime characteristics are completely different from those of the manifest universe. The Lord is therefore the supreme transcendental entity, free from all material influence."

There are many so-called wise men in the world, but although considering themselves to be most intelligent, they generally do not surrender to the supreme intelligence of the Lord. Thus they concoct varieties of philosophies according to their positions within the modes of nature. However, one cannot escape the influence of material nature through philosophy generated from that same illusory nature. Liberation is achieved by perfect knowledge coming from the spiritual platform, the kingdom of God. By faithfully hearing from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His authorized representatives one can easily achieve liberation and go back home, back to Godhead."

As death occurs, the mind is pulled away from the objects of its immediate experience and enters another body to experience a new set of sense objects. As the mind undergoes total reorientation there is the apparent loss of one\u2019s previous mentality and creation of a new mind, though actually the same mind is experiencing, but in a different way. The conditioned soul is overwhelmed by the constant flow of material experience consisting of direct perception and abstract contemplation of the objects of this world. One thereby loses his transcendental memory of his relationship with God.

Death occurs when the specific karma allotted to a physical body is finished. Since that particular body\u2019s karma is used up, it can no longer act upon one\u2019s mind; in that way one forgets the previous body. The new body is created by nature so that one can experience the karma currently in effect. Consequently one\u2019s entire consciousness becomes absorbed in one\u2019s current body in order that one can fully experience the results of his previous activities. Because the living entity falsely identifies himself as the body, bodily death is experienced as death of the soul.

Thus the self creates external and internal duality, just as a man might give birth to a bad son.",
        "purport": " The wealth, beauty, strength, intelligence, fame and detachment of different bodies are considered to be excellent, normal or inferior according to the material situation. The spirit soul acquires a particular body and thus judges himself and others to be high, middle or low class according to their material situation. Actually, the eternal soul exists beyond material duality but falsely mistakes the material situation to be his own. The words asaj-jana-k\u1e5bd yath\u0101 are significant. A father may by nature be peaceful, but because his bad son gets into trouble the father is forced to defend his son and consider his son\u2019s enemies to be enemies of the entire family. Thus the bad son implicates the father in troublesome conflicts. Similarly, the spirit soul has no intrinsic problems, but by creating a false identification with the material body the soul becomes involved in the happiness and distress of the body. With this verse the Lord summarizes His discussion of the difference between the body and the soul."

The waves of a flowing river rise and fall, creating innumerable shapes and patterns. The fruits of a tree gradually take birth, grow, ripen, sweeten and eventually rot and die. Similarly, one can easily understand that one\u2019s own body is undergoing constant transformation, and that the body is certainly subject to old age, disease and death. At different times of life the body exhibits degrees of sexual potency, physical strength, desire, wisdom and so on. As the body grows old, physical strength diminishes, but one\u2019s knowledge may increase even as the body undergoes such transformation. Material birth and death occur within the realm of segmented time. The birth, creation or production of a material object immediately connects it with a segmented sequence of subtle time within the material world. Thus its destruction or death is inevitable. The irresistible force of time moves so subtly that only the most intelligent can perceive it. Just as the candle flame gradually diminishes, as the flowing currents move within the river or as fruits gradually ripen on a tree, the material body is steadily moving toward inevitable death. The temporary body should therefore never be confused with the eternal, unchanging spirit soul."

Similarly, when one meets a young child, one accepts that particular transitory phase of the body as the actual identity of the person, considering him to be a child. One also considers an old body to be an old person. In fact, however, the material body of a human being, just like the waves of a river or the radiation of a lamp, is merely a transformation of the three modes of material nature, the potency of the Supreme Lord. The real identity of a person is spirit soul, part and parcel of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proves in this verse, a conditioned soul is incapable of observing or understanding the subtle movements of time. With the gross vision of material consciousness one cannot ascertain the subtle segments of material manifestation, which are impelled by the Lord Himself as time. The word m\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101yu\u1e63\u0101m in this verse indicates those who are uselessly wasting their time in ignorance without understanding the instructions of the Lord. Such persons gullibly accept any particular phase of the body to be the actual identity of the spirit soul within the body. Because the spirit soul is not subject to material transformation, when he engages himself in the eternal variegated pleasure of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, loving service to the Supreme Lord, he will experience no further ignorance and suffering."

One may argue that a living entity cannot remember his presence in the mother\u2019s womb nor his birth and early infancy. The Lord therefore states here that one can experience these phases of bodily existence by studying one\u2019s own child. Similarly, although one may hope to live forever, by experiencing the death of one\u2019s father, grandfather or great-grandfather, one has definite proof that the material body will die. A sober person, knowing the soul to be eternal, therefore gives up false identification with the temporary, unreliable body and takes shelter of the devotional service of the Lord. By this process one can escape the artificial imposition of birth and death."

The Lord therefore explains here that although not factual, material life stubbornly continues for one addicted to sense gratification, just as a frightening dream continues for one merged in sleep. The word avidyam\u0101na, \u201cnot existing,\u201d means that material life is based on mental concoction, in which one thinks, \u201cI am a man,\u201d \u201cI am a woman,\u201d \u201cI am a doctor,\u201d \u201cI am a senator,\u201d \u201cI am a street sweeper\u201d and so on. A conditioned soul enthusiastically performs his activities based on the imaginary identification with the body. Thus although the spirit soul exists and the body exists, the false identification with the body does not exist. Material life, based on a false idea, has no factual existence. After one awakens from a dream, the dim reflection of the dream may linger in one\u2019s memory. Similarly, one engaging in the devotional service of the Lord may be troubled sometimes by the dim reflection of sinful life. One should therefore become strong in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by hearing the Lord\u2019s instructions to \u015ar\u012b Uddhava."

When selecting one\u2019s personal object of enjoyment, such as food, clothing, residence or vehicle, one considers the relative quality of the object to be acquired. Consequently, in material life one is in constant anxiety, trying to acquire the most excellent sense gratification for one\u2019s personal pleasure. If one realizes everything as the property of the Lord, however, he will see everything as meant for the Lord\u2019s pleasure. He will feel no personal anxiety, because he is satisfied simply to be engaged in the Lord\u2019s loving service. It is not possible to exploit the property of the Lord and at the same time advance in self-realization."
