        "purport": " Saintly persons in the renounced order of life may beg from strict followers of Vedic culture to obtain foodstuffs and other bodily necessities. According to Vedic injunction, a renounced saint should beg from the br\u0101hma\u1e47a community, but if there is danger of his starving, he may beg from k\u1e63atriyas, then vai\u015byas, and even \u015b\u016bdras if they are not sinful, as expressed here by the word vigarhy\u0101n. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that asa\u1e45k\u1e37pt\u0101n indicates that one should not approach certain houses, calculating, \u201cIn that place I can get first-class food. That house has a big reputation among beggars.\u201d Without discriminating, one should go to seven houses and be satisfied with whatever may be obtained there. One should beg for one\u2019s personal maintenance only from houses where the inhabitants, being sincere followers of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama culture, have earned their livelihood by honest means and are free from sinful activities. One may beg alms from such householders. One must not beg alms for one\u2019s personal maintenance from those who oppose the Supreme Lord\u2019s devotional service, for such service is the whole purpose of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama culture. Those who oppose Vedic culture pass laws to make begging by saintly persons a criminal act. They thus insult and persecute saintly beggars, considering them to be ordinary vagrants. A lazy person begging to avoid work is certainly abominable, but a saintly person dedicated to the service of the Lord and practicing the discipline of begging to develop full dependence on the Lord\u2019s mercy should be given all facility in human society. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that there are three forms of collecting alms. M\u0101dhukara is the process of imitating the bee, who collects a tiny amount of nectar from each flower. In this way, the saintly person accepts a very small amount from each person, avoiding social conflict. The process mentioned here is asa\u1e45k\u1e37pta, by which one indiscriminately approaches seven houses, being satisfied with whatever may be obtained. Pr\u0101k-pra\u1e47\u012bta is that process by which one establishes regular donors and collects one\u2019s maintenance from them. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya has described the initial stage of sanny\u0101sa, called ku\u1e6d\u012bcaka, as follows. A man accepting the initial stage of sanny\u0101sa arranges for his children or other relatives and well-wishers to build him a ku\u1e6d\u012b, or meditation cottage. He gives up worldly affairs and sits within the cottage, trying to remain free from lust, anger, greed, illusion and so on. According to the prescribed injunctions of regulated life, he accepts a trida\u1e47\u1e0da, purifies himself with a waterpot, shaves his head (leaving a \u015bikh\u0101, or tuft), chants G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra on the sacred thread and wears saffron garments. Bathing regularly, cleansing, performing \u0101camana, chanting japa, studying the Vedas, remaining celibate and meditating on the Lord, he receives regular supplies of food from his children, friends and relatives. Accepting only the bare necessities of life, he remains fixed in his cottage up to the moment of liberation."

        "translation": "Without any material attachment, with senses fully controlled, remaining enthusiastic, and satisfied in realization of the Supreme Lord and his own self, the saintly person should travel about the earth alone. Having equal vision everywhere, he should be steady on the spiritual platform.",
        "purport": " One who remains attached to material sense gratification cannot be steady in the process of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Being shackled by illusory desires, he is not able to fully control the senses. Actually, one should take shelter of devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day, for by such service one remains within the scope of spiritual reality. By chanting and hearing the holy names of the Lord along with the Lord\u2019s glories and pastimes, one naturally drifts away from the field of material sense gratification. Good association with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotees automatically vanquishes useless material association, and one is able to carry out the Vedic injunctions meant to lift the conditioned soul out of the material field and onto the liberated platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b states in his Upade\u015b\u0101m\u1e5bta (4): \u201cOffering gifts in charity, accepting charitable gifts, revealing one\u2019s mind in confidence, inquiring confidentially, accepting pras\u0101dam and offering pras\u0101dam are the six symptoms of love shared by one devotee and another.\u201d One who thus learns to associate with the Lord\u2019s devotees actually remains insulated from the contamination of material life. By pure association one gradually understands the name, form, qualities, associates, pastimes and devotional service of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus even in this lifetime one can become a resident of the spiritual world. In the association of pure devotees there is no material contamination and no useless discussion, since all pure devotees are fully engaged twenty-four hours a day in the loving service of the Lord. By the influence of such devotees, one develops equal vision (sama-dar\u015bana) and sees the realized knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness everywhere. As one begins to understand his eternal relationship with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he becomes \u0101tma-v\u0101n, situated in his constitutional position. An advanced Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, constantly enjoying the mellows of loving devotional service and carrying out the mission of the Lord on the earth, is \u0101tma-kr\u012b\u1e0da, one who enjoys life within the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. The advanced devotee remains constantly attracted to the Supreme Lord and His devotees and is therefore \u0101tma-rata, fully satisfied by constant engagement in devotional service. One cannot possibly develop the exalted qualities mentioned here without becoming an unalloyed devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who is envious of the Lord and His devotees becomes attracted to bad association, gradually loses control of the senses and falls down into the network of impious life. The innumerable varieties of nondevotees are like branches sprouting from the single tree of enviousness of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and their association should be given up by all means. Without unalloyed devotional service to the Lord, one loses touch with the desire and mission of the Personality of Godhead and becomes attracted to worshiping the wonderful male and female creations of the Lord\u2019s illusory energy \u2014 demigods, demigoddesses, celebrities, politicians, prostitutes, etc. In this way, one foolishly considers something besides Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be supremely wonderful. Actually, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only true object of worship for those desiring to experience unlimited beauty and pleasure. By seriously taking to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one can realize the transcendental position of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and gradually develop all of the qualities mentioned in this verse."

        "purport": " One who is engaged exclusively in the devotional service of the Lord in one of the five principal relationships is to be known as a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Because of his advanced stage of love of Godhead, a pure devotee is able to constantly chant the glories of the Lord without material hindrance. He is not interested in anything except Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and never considers himself to be qualitatively different from the Lord. One who is still attracted by the gross material body and subtle material mind, which cover the eternal soul, continues to see himself as different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This misconception is due to false identification with matter. With senses purified of material contamination, one must serve the Lord, who is the master of all senses, and thus one\u2019s devotional service is considered free from discrepancy. One who ignores the injunctions of Vedic literature uselessly wastes his sense activity in illusory material activities. He falsely considers himself to be different from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and therefore imagines that he possesses an interest independent of the Lord\u2019s interest. There is no possibility that such a person can achieve steadiness in life, because the material field of action is constantly being shifted and transformed by the disturbing influence of time. If a devotee begins to cultivate an interest apart from the loving service of the Lord, his meditation on his oneness with the Lord will be disturbed and overturned. When the mind deviates from the lotus feet of the Lord, the duality of material nature again becomes prominent within the mind, and one resumes a work program based on the three modes of material nature. One who is not fixed in one\u2019s own relationship with the Supreme Lord cannot be fearless or steady and is deprived of the shelter of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore one should seriously contemplate, as described in this verse, one\u2019s identity as a small particle of consciousness not different from the supreme consciousness, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus one should remain steady in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

The author of this book remembers entering the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness society as an arrogant university student and being quickly humbled by the process of begging on the street on behalf of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This process is not theoretical but actually purifies one\u2019s existence by forcing one to offer respect to all others. Unless one offers respect to others, one\u2019s begging will be fruitless. Also, by begging one will not often eat very sumptuously. This is good because when the tongue is controlled the other senses are quickly pacified. A v\u0101naprastha should never give up the purifying process of begging for his food, and ordinary people should not foolishly equate a lazy bum living at the cost of others with a saintly beggar engaged in higher duties for the Supreme Lord."

When one completely purifies the mind, there is no possibility of sinful behavior. Rules and regulations are meant for guiding those who have a tendency to act in ignorance or for personal gratification, but one who is perfect in spiritual consciousness can move freely, as described here by the Lord. One who tends to drive a car recklessly or who is unfamiliar with the local road conditions certainly needs the discipline of elaborate road signs and police enforcement of traffic laws. A perfectly safe driver, however, is thoroughly familiar with the local road conditions. He has no real need for the enforcement officials or the speed limits and caution signs meant for those unfamiliar with the road. A pure devotee of the Lord desires nothing except service to the Lord; he automatically fulfills the purport of all negative and positive injunctions, which is to always remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and never forget Him. One should not, however, artificially imitate the exalted position of a paramaha\u1e41sa devotee, for such imitation will quickly ruin one\u2019s spiritual career. In the previous verses the Lord has elaborately described various rituals, paraphernalia and disciplines for the various spiritual orders of life. The sanny\u0101s\u012b, for example, carries a trida\u1e47\u1e0da and a waterpot and eats and lives in a particular way. A paramaha\u1e41sa devotee, having completely given up all attachment and interest in the material world, is no longer attracted by such external features of renunciation."

Although neglecting ordinary rules and regulations, a paramaha\u1e41sa does not ever become sinful or immoral, but rather neglects ritualistic aspects of religious custom, such as dressing in a particular way, performing certain ceremonies or executing specific penances and austerities. The pure devotees of the Lord who have dedicated their lives to propagating the Lord\u2019s holy name must very expertly present K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in a way pleasing to the mass of people so that they will accept it. Those who are preaching should try to make Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a popular without trying to advance their personal prestige in the name of missionary progress. A paramaha\u1e41sa not engaged in distributing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, should have no attachment whatsoever to public opinion."

Similarly, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, or self-realized soul, is fixed on the spiritual platform, beyond the material body, and should therefore execute the regulative duties in relation to the material body by his own free will and not as a servant of the rules and regulations. A self-realized soul is a servant of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not of rules and regulations. Nevertheless, a transcendentalist strictly complies with regular duties for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. In other words, one who is advanced in loving devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spontaneously moves according to the will of the Supreme. One who is perfectly situated in spiritual realization cannot become a servant of the material body or of rules and regulations concerning the material body. However, this verse and other similar statements in Vedic scriptures should not be ignorantly misinterpreted to justify immoral, whimsical behavior. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is discussing the paramaha\u1e41sa stage of life, and those who are attached to the material body have nothing to do with this paramaha\u1e41sa stage, nor should they exploit its unique privileges and status."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explained in verse 32 of this chapter that all material and spiritual objects are expansions of His potency. By realized knowledge of the Lord one gives up the illusion that anything, anywhere, at any time, can be separate from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has also explained, however, that one must keep the material body and mind fit for executing devotional service; therefore even a self-realized soul may sometimes appear to accept or reject certain conditions or objects within this world. Such brief apparent duality of concentration upon something other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not change the liberated status of a self-realized soul, who achieves at the time of death the same opulences as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the spiritual world. The function of illusion is to separate one from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but the brief and occasional appearance of duality in the behavior or mentality of a pure devotee never separates him from the Lord. It does not constitute actual illusion, for it lacks the essential function of illusion, namely, the separation of one from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura describes the self-realized devotees as follows. The devotee of the Lord does not see anything as separate from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thus does not consider himself to be a permanent resident of the material world. At every moment the devotee is moved by his desire to serve Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Just as those who are inclined to sense gratification pass their time making arrangements for their enjoyment, similarly the devotees are busy throughout the day arranging their devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore they have no time to act like materialistic sense enjoyers. To ordinary persons it may seem that a pure devotee is seeing something as separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but a pure devotee is actually fixed in his status as a liberated soul and is guaranteed to achieve a spiritual body in the kingdom of God. Ordinary, materialistic persons cannot always understand the activities of a pure devotee of the Lord, and thus they may try to minimize his position, considering him to be the same as themselves. At the end of life, however, the results achieved by the devotees of the Lord and ordinary materialists are vastly different."

In any social or occupational division of human society one must be a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worship Him alone. The bona fide spiritual master is the representative of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and worship of the \u0101c\u0101rya goes directly to the lotus feet of the Lord. Although ordinary householders are sometimes ordered by Vedic injunctions to worship particular demigods or forefathers, one should remember that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is within all living entities. As stated here, sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u mad-bh\u0101va\u1e25. The pure devotees of the Lord worship the Lord alone, and those who cannot come to the standard of pure devotional service should at least meditate upon the Personality of Godhead within the demigods and all other living entities, understanding that all religious processes are ultimately meant for the pleasure of the Lord. In the course of missionary work even pure devotees must deal with government leaders and other prominent members of society, sometimes praising such persons and complying with their orders. Yet because the devotees are always meditating on Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a situated as the Supersoul within everyone, they are therefore acting for the Lord\u2019s pleasure and not for the pleasure of any ordinary human being. Those persons dealing with different demigods in the course of their var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama duties should similarly see the Lord as the basis of everything. They should concentrate on pleasing the Supreme Lord by all activities. This stage of life is called love of God, and it brings one to the point of actual liberation."
