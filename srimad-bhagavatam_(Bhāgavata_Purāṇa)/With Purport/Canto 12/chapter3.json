P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is understood to be an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who completely exhibited the characteristics of an earthly king, claiming proprietorship over the entire earth. A saintly king like P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, controls the earth on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas a demon such as Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu or R\u0101va\u1e47a tries to exploit the earth for his personal sense gratification. Nevertheless, both saintly kings and demons must leave the earth. In this way their political supremacy is ultimately neutralized by the force of time. Modern political leaders cannot even temporarily control the entire earth, nor are their opulences and intelligence unlimited. Possessing hopelessly fragmented power, enjoying a minuscule life span, and lacking deep existential intelligence, modern leaders inevitably are symbols of frustration and misdirected ambition."

These four legs of powerful religion are truthfulness, mercy, austerity and charity.",
        "purport": " Just as there are four seasons, there are four ages of the earth, each lasting hundreds of thousands of years. The first of these is Satya-yuga, when such good qualities as charity are prominent. Actual charity, here referred to as d\u0101nam, is to award fearlessness and freedom to others, not to give them some material means of temporary pleasure or relief. Any material \u201ccharitable\u201d arrangement will inevitably be crushed by the onward march of time. Thus only realization of one\u2019s eternal existence beyond the reach of time can make one fearless, and only freedom from material desire constitutes real freedom, for it enables one to escape the bondage of the laws of nature. Therefore real charity is to help people revive their eternal, spiritual consciousness. Religion is here referred to as vibhu, \u201cthe mighty,\u201d because universal religious principles are not different from the Supreme Lord Himself and ultimately lead one to His kingdom. The qualities mentioned here \u2014 truthfulness, mercy, austerity and charity \u2014 are universal, nonsectarian aspects of pious life. In the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the fourth leg of religion is listed as cleanliness. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, this is an alternative definition of the word d\u0101nam in the present context."

For example, it is understood that no sane person will walk in New York\u2019s Central Park at night because he knows he will almost certainly be mugged. Apart from ordinary thieves, who abound in this age, large cities are filled with cutthroat businessmen, who enthusiastically convince people to purchase and consume useless or even harmful products.

Modern cities are full of mental and atmospheric pollution, and even ordinary citizens are finding them unbearable. This verse also points out that the teachings of the Vedic scriptures will be distorted in this age. Great universities teach courses on Hinduism in which Indian religion, despite limitless evidence to the contrary, is described as polytheistic and leading to an impersonal salvation. In fact, all Vedic literature is a unified whole, as stated by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. \u201cBy all the Vedas I [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a] am to be known.\u201d All Vedic literature is meant for enlightening us about the Supreme Personal Absolute Truth \u2014 Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although known by many names and appearing in many forms, God is a single absolute entity, and He is a person. But this true Vedic understanding is hidden in the Kali-yuga. In this verse \u015aukadeva astutely observes that \u201cpolitical leaders will virtually consume the citizens, and the so-called priests and intellectuals will be devotees of their bellies and genitals.\u201d How sadly true this statement is."

In Vedic culture, at the age of fifty, couples retire to sacred places for austere life and spiritual perfection. In countries like America, however, retirement cities have been constructed wherein elderly people can make fools of themselves by wasting the last years of their lives playing golf, ping-pong and shuffleboard and by engaging in pathetic attempts at love affairs even while their bodies are horribly rotting and their minds are growing senile. This shameless abuse of the venerable last years of life denotes a stubborn unwillingness to acknowledge the actual purpose of human life and is certainly an offense against God. The words ny\u0101sino\u00a0\u2019tyartha-lolup\u0101\u1e25 indicate that charismatic religious leaders, and even those who are not charismatic, will proclaim themselves prophets, saints and incarnations to cheat the innocent public and fatten their bank accounts. Therefore the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is working arduously to establish bona fide celibate student life, religious householder life, dignified and progressive retirement, and genuine spiritual leadership for the entire world. Today, May 9, 1982, in the sensual city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, we have awarded sanny\u0101sa, the renounced order of life, to three young men, two Brazilians and one American, with the sincere hope that they will faithfully execute the rigid vows of renounced life and provide authentic spiritual leadership in South America."

Young children are also tormented in many ways in this age. Suicide among children has increased dramatically in recent years because they are being born not to loving, religious parents but to degraded, selfish men and women. In fact, children are often born because a birth-control pill, a prophylactic or some other contraceptive device malfunctioned. Under such conditions, it is very difficult nowadays for parents to morally guide their children. Generally ignorant of spiritual science, parents cannot lead their children on the path of liberation and thus fail to fulfill their primary responsibility in family life. As predicted in this verse, adultery has become common, and people in general are extremely concerned with eating and sex, which they consider far more important than knowing the Absolute Truth."

        "translation": "O King, in the Age of Kali people\u2019s intelligence will be diverted by atheism, and they will almost never offer sacrifice to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme spiritual master of the universe. Although the great personalities who control the three worlds all bow down to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, the petty and miserable human beings of this age will not do so.",
        "purport": " The impulse to find the Absolute Truth, the source of all existence, has motivated philosophers, theologians and other intellectuals of various persuasions since time immemorial, and continues to do so today. However, soberly analyzing the ever-increasing plurality of so-called philosophies, religions, paths, ways of life and so on, we find that in almost all cases the ultimate objective is something impersonal or formless. But this idea of an impersonal or formless Absolute Truth has serious logical flaws. According to ordinary rules of logic, a particular effect should directly or indirectly embody the attributes, or nature, of its own cause. Thus that which has no personality or activity could hardly be the source of all personality and all activity. Our irrepressible proclivity to philosophize about the ultimate truth often expresses itself through philosophical, scientific and mystical attempts to discover that from which everything emanates. This material world, which is a seemingly limitless network of interactive causes and effects, is certainly not the Absolute Truth, since scientific observation of material elements indicates that the stuff of this world, material energy, is endlessly transformed into different states and shapes. Therefore, one particular instance of material reality cannot be the ultimate source of all other things. We may speculate that matter in some shape or other has always existed. This theory, however, is no longer attractive to modern cosmologists, such as those at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And even if we do posit that matter has always existed, we still must explain the source of consciousness if we want to satisfy our philosophical impulse toward discovering the Absolute Truth. Although modern empirical fanatics state that nothing is real except matter, everyone commonly experiences that consciousness is not the same kind of substance as a stone, a pencil or water. Awareness itself, in contradistinction to the objects of awareness, is not a physical entity but rather a process of perception and understanding. While there is ample evidence of a systematic interdependent relationship between matter and consciousness, there is no rigid empirical evidence whatsoever that matter is the cause of consciousness. Thus the theory that the material world has always existed and is therefore the ultimate truth does not scientifically or even intuitively explain the source of consciousness, which is the most fundamentally real aspect of our existence. Furthermore, as demonstrated by Dr. Richard Thompson of the State University of New York at Binghamton and confirmed by several Nobel laureates in physics who have praised his work, the laws of nature governing the transformation of matter simply do not contain sufficiently complex information to account for the inconceivable complexity of events taking place within our own bodies and those of other life forms. In other words, not only do the material laws of nature fail to account for the existence of consciousness, but they cannot explain even the interaction of material elements at complex organic levels. Even Socrates, the first great Western philosopher, was disgusted with the attempt to establish ultimate causality in terms of mechanistic principles. The heat and luminosity of the sun\u2019s rays demonstrate to the satisfaction of any rational man that the sun, the source of the rays, is certainly not a dark, cold globe but rather a reservoir of almost unlimited heat and light. Similarly, the innumerable instances of personality and personal consciousness within creation are more than adequate to demonstrate the existence, somewhere, of an unlimited reservoir of consciousness and personal behavior. In his dialogue Philebus, the Greek philosopher Plato argued that just as the material elements in our body are derived from a vast reservoir of material elements existing within the universe, our rational intelligence is also derived from a great cosmic intelligence existing within the universe, and this supreme intelligence is God, the creator. Unfortunately, in Kali-yuga many leading thinkers cannot understand this and instead deny that the Absolute Truth, the source of our personal consciousness, has consciousness and personality. This is as reasonable as saying that the sun is cold and dark. In Kali-yuga, many people present cheap, stereotyped arguments, such as \u201cIf God had a body or personality, He would be limited.\u201d In this inadequate attempt at logic, a qualified term is falsely presented in a universal sense. What really should be said is, \u201cIf God had a material body or a material personality like those we have experienced, He would be limited.\u201d But we leave out the qualifying adjective material and make a pseudouniversal assertion, as if we understood the full range, within total reality, of bodies and personality. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and other Vedic literatures teach that the transcendental form and personality of the Absolute Truth are unlimited. Clearly, to be truly infinite God must be not only quantitatively but also qualitatively infinite. Unfortunately, in our mechanistic, industrial age we tend to define infinity only in its quantitative sense, and thus we fail to notice that an infinity of personal qualities is a necessary aspect of infinity. In other words, God must have infinite beauty, infinite wealth, infinite intelligence, infinite humor, infinite kindness, infinite anger and so on. Infinite is an absolute, and if anything we observe in this world is not contained, somehow or other, within our conception of the Absolute, then that conception is of something limited and not of the Absolute at all. Only in Kali-yuga are there philosophers foolish enough to proudly define the most absolute of all terms \u2014 God \u2014 in materialistic, relative ways and then declare themselves enlightened thinkers. No matter how big our brain may be, we should have the common sense to place it at the feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " A similar verse is found in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (6.2.17), and also in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a (Uttara-kha\u1e47\u1e0da 72.25) and the B\u1e5bhan-n\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a (38.97): \u201cWhatever is achieved by meditation in Satya-yuga, by the performance of sacrifice in Tret\u0101-yuga, and by the worship of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet in Dv\u0101para-yuga is obtained in the Age of Kali simply by glorifying the name of Lord Ke\u015bava.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has further quoted from the Brahma-vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47a concerning the degraded condition of people in Kali-yuga: \u201cThus in the Age of Kali the practices of austerity, yoga meditation, Deity worship, sacrifice and so on, along with their various subsidiary functions, are not properly carried out, even by the most expert embodied souls.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has also cited the C\u0101turm\u0101sya-m\u0101h\u0101tmya of the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a concerning the necessity of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this age: \u201cIn this way the most perfect penance to be executed in this world is the chanting of the name of Lord \u015ar\u012b Hari. Especially in the Age of Kali, one can satisfy the Supreme Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u by performing sa\u1e45k\u012brtana.\u201d In conclusion, massive propaganda should be made all over the world to induce people to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, by which human society can be rescued from the dangerous ocean of the Age of Kali."
