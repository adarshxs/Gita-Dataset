In You does not exist the mighty flow of the modes of material nature, which is based on illusion and ignorance.",
        "purport": " The great Bh\u0101gavatam commentator \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has masterfully explained the Sanskrit elements of this profound verse. The Sanskrit word dh\u0101ma has several meanings: a) dwelling place, house, abode and so on; b) a favorite thing or person; delight; or pleasure; c) form or appearance; d) power, strength, majesty, glory, splendor or light. Concerning the first set of meanings, the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra states that the Absolute Truth is the source and resting place of all existence, and in the first verse of the Bh\u0101gavatam that Absolute Truth is said to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exists in His own dh\u0101ma, or abode, called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, He Himself is the abode of all existence, as Arjuna confirms in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, where he addresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma, \u201cthe supreme abode.\u201d The very name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates the all-attractive person, and thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the source of all beauty and pleasure, is certainly \u201cthe favorite thing or person; delight; and pleasure.\u201d Ultimately these terms can refer only to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Dh\u0101ma also refers to form or appearance, and as Indra offered these prayers he was in fact directly seeing the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a before him. As clearly explained in the Vedic literature, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s power, strength, majesty, splendor and effulgence are all contained within His transcendental body and thus attest to the infinite glories of the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has brilliantly summarized all these meanings of the word dh\u0101ma by giving the Sanskrit term svar\u016bpa as a synonym. The word svar\u016bpa means \u201cone\u2019s own form or shape\u201d and also \u201cone\u2019s own condition, character or nature.\u201d Since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being pure spirit, is nondifferent from His body, there is absolutely no difference between the Lord and His visible form. By contrast, in this material world we conditioned souls are all distinctly different from our bodies, whether those bodies be male, female, black, white or whatever. All of us are eternal souls, different from our temporary, flimsy bodies. When the word svar\u016bpa is applied to us, it especially indicates our spiritual form, because our \u201cown form\u201d is in fact our \u201cown condition, character or nature\u201d eternally. Thus the liberated condition in which one\u2019s outward form is one\u2019s deepest spiritual nature is called svar\u016bpa. Primarily, however, this term refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is all indicated in this verse by the words tava dh\u0101ma, as explained by \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b. \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has explained that here the word \u015b\u0101ntam means \u201calways in the same form.\u201d \u015a\u0101ntam can also mean \u201cundisturbed, free from passion, or purified.\u201d According to Vedic philosophy, all change in this world is caused by the influence of passion and ignorance. The passionate mode is creative, and the ignorant mode is destructive, whereas the mode of goodness, sattva, is serene and sustaining. In many ways this verse emphasizes that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is free from the modes of nature. The words vi\u015buddha-sattvam, \u015b\u0101ntam, dhvasta-rajas-tamaskam and gu\u1e47a-samprav\u0101ho na vidyate te all indicate this. Unlike K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we change from one body to another because of our involvement with the modes of nature; the various transformations of material forms are impelled by the modes of nature, which are themselves set in motion by the influence of time. Therefore one who is free from the material modes of nature is changeless and eternally satisfied in blissful spiritual existence. Thus the word \u015b\u0101ntam indicates that the Lord is undisturbed by change, since He is free from the material modes of nature. According to this verse, the powerful flow of the material modes of nature \u2014 namely passion, stupidity and mundane piety \u2014 are based on agraha\u1e47a, which \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has translated as \u201cignorance.\u201d Since the Sanskrit root gra\u1e25 means \u201cto take, accept, grasp or comprehend,\u201d graha\u1e47a means \u201cgrasp\u201d exactly in the sense of \u201cto grasp an idea or fact.\u201d Therefore agraha\u1e47a here means one\u2019s failure to understand one\u2019s spiritual position, and this failure causes one to fall into the violent currents of material existence. An additional meaning of the word agraha\u1e47a is derived when it is divided into the compound agra-ha\u1e47a. Agra means \u201cthe first, top or best,\u201d and hana means \u201ckilling.\u201d The best part of our existence is the pure soul, which is eternal, in contradistinction to the temporary, material body and mind. Thus one who chooses material existence over K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is in fact killing the best part of himself, the soul, which in its pure state can enjoy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness unlimitedly. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has translated tapo-mayam as \u201cfull of knowledge.\u201d The word tapas, generally indicating \u201causterity,\u201d is derived from the Sanskrit verb tap, whose meaning can be summarized as indicating the various functions of the sun. Tap means \u201cto burn, to shine, to heat and so on.\u201d The Supreme Lord is eternally perfect, and therefore here tapo-mayam does not indicate that His transcendental body is meant for austerities, since austerities are performed by conditioned souls to purify themselves or to acquire a particular power. An omnipotent, perfect being neither purifies Himself nor acquires power: He is eternally pure and all-powerful. Therefore \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has intelligently understood that in this case the word tapas refers to the illuminating function of the sun and thus indicates that the Lord\u2019s self-effulgent body is omniscient. Light is a common symbol of knowledge. The Lord\u2019s spiritual effulgence does not merely illuminate physically, as in the case of a candle or light bulb; more importantly, the Lord\u2019s body illuminates our consciousness with perfect knowledge because the Lord\u2019s effulgence is itself perfect knowledge. We offer our respectful obeisances at the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b and thank him for his enlightening comments on this verse."

        "translation": "How, then, could there exist in You the symptoms of an ignorant person \u2014 such as greed, lust, anger and envy \u2014 which are produced by one\u2019s previous involvement in material existence and which cause one to become further entangled in material existence? And yet as the Supreme Lord You impose punishment to protect religious principles and curb down the wicked.",
        "purport": " This complex philosophical statement by Indra may be analyzed as follows: In the first line of this verse, Indra refers to the main idea expressed at the end of the previous verse \u2014 namely, that the great currents of material existence, which are based on ignorance, cannot possibly exist within the Supreme Lord. The words tad-dhetava\u1e25 and tat-k\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25 indicate that something causes the modes of nature to manifest, and that they in turn become the cause of that which caused them. In the second line of this verse, we find that it is material feelings such as greed, lust, envy and anger that cause the modes of nature to manifest and that are themselves caused by the modes of nature. The explanation of this seeming paradox is as follows: When the conditioned soul decides to associate with the material qualities, he becomes contaminated by those qualities. As stated in the G\u012bt\u0101 (13.22), k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go\u00a0\u2019sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu. For example, in the presence of a seductive woman, a man may give in to his lower instincts and try to enjoy sex with her. By his deciding to associate with the lower qualities of nature, those qualities manifest in him very powerfully. He is overwhelmed with lust and driven to try again and again to satisfy his burning desire. Because his mind has been infected by lust, all that he does, thinks and speaks will be influenced by his strong attachment to sex. In other words, by choosing to associate with the lusty qualities of nature, he has caused them to powerfully manifest within himself, and eventually those lusty qualities themselves will cause him to accept another material body suitable for affairs governed by those qualities. The lower qualities, such as lust, greed, anger and envy, are abudha-li\u1e45ga-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25, symptoms of ignorance. Indeed, as indicated by \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b in his commentary, the manifestation of the modes of nature is synonymous with the manifestation of a particular material body. It is clearly explained throughout the Vedic literature that the conditioned soul receives a particular body, gives it up and then accepts another simply because of his involvement with the modes of nature (k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go\u00a0\u2019sya). Thus to say that one is participating in the modes of nature is to say that one is accepting particular types of bodies suitable for the particular material qualities one is involved with. An ignorant bystander might have simplistically interpreted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastime of lifting Govardhana Hill as follows: The residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana were obliged by Vedic principles to make certain offerings to the god of heaven, Indra. Child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, ignoring the position of Indra, usurped these offerings and took them for His own pleasure. When Indra tried to punish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His associates, the Lord frustrated Indra\u2019s attempt, humiliated him, and exhausted his pride and resources. But this superficial interpretation is refuted in this verse. Here Lord Indra addresses \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as bhagav\u0101n, indicating that He is not an ordinary child but in fact God. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s punishing Indra was part of His mission of protecting religious principles and curbing down the envious; it was not a display of material anger or of greed for the offerings meant for Indra. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is pure spiritual existence, and His simple, sublime desire is to engage all living beings in the perfect, blissful life of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s desire to make us K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is not egotistical, since ultimately K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everything and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is objectively the best consciousness. Lord Indra is really the humble servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, a fact he is now beginning to remember."

        "purport": " History is filled with examples of the supreme authority breaking the conceit of foolish men. Modern world leaders proudly fight one another, placing the common people in unprecedented jeopardy. Similarly Indra, proud of his apparently illustrious position, dared to threaten the lives of the innocent residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana with terrible weapons, until his arrogance was curbed by the dynamic response of the Supreme Lord. Nowadays, governments in the Western countries tend to be elected democratically, and thus the mass of people become identified with the destiny of their leaders. When the proud leaders engage in violence, the people who elected them bear the brunt of such belligerent decisions. Thus the people in the democratic nations of the world should elect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious leaders, who will establish an administration consonant with the laws of God. If they fail to do so, their materialistic leaders, oblivious of the will of the Supreme Lord, will undoubtedly be chastised by cataclysmic events, and the people who elected such leaders, being responsible for their leaders\u2019 acts, will share in the suffering. It is ironic that in modern democracies not only do the leaders consider themselves universal controllers, but the mass of people, considering the leaders merely their representatives rather than the representatives of God, also consider themselves, as a people, to be the controllers of their nation. Thus the chastisement mentioned in this verse has become unprecedentedly applicable to people in general in the modern world. Modern man should not simply make himself a lesson of nature by falling down from his proud position; rather he should submissively execute the will of the all-attractive Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and usher in a new era of sanity, tranquillity and widespread enlightenment."

        "purport": " This verse utilizes an attractive poetic device. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s descent into the world is said to be for the abhava, literally \u201cnonexistence\u201d or \u201cdestruction,\u201d of the demoniac warlords, and simultaneously for the bhava, or \u201cexistence, prosperity,\u201d of those who faithfully serve the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. True existence, indicated here by the word bhava, is sac-cid-\u0101nanda, eternal and full of bliss and knowledge. To an uninformed observer, it may appear that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is simply rewarding His followers and punishing His enemies the way any ordinary person might do. This specific doubt about the Lord is raised extensively in the Sixth Canto in connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s taking the side of the faithful demigods against the faithless demons in a particular cosmic war. In that canto the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava authorities clearly explain that in fact Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the father and Lord of all living beings and that all His activities are therefore meant for the benefit of all existence. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not really cause the nonexistence of anyone; rather He curbs the foolish, destructive, material ways of those who defy the laws of God. These laws are created to ensure the prosperity, harmony and happiness of the entire creation, and their violation is an unjustifiable disturbance. Certainly Indra hoped that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would count him among the devotees and not the demons, although considering Indra\u2019s actions one might doubt where his loyalties actually lay. Indra was aware of this possible doubt and thus, as we find in the next verse, he tried his best to surrender to the Supreme Lord."

        "purport": " We could hardly construe from the first line of this verse that God is somehow impersonal but assumes a personal material body. It is clearly said here that the Lord assumes different forms according to svacchanda \u2014 according to His own desire or according to the desires of His devotees. An impersonal God could hardly reciprocate with the personal desires of Its devotees, nor could an impersonal God Itself have desires, since desire is characteristic of personality. Therefore, the Lord\u2019s manifesting different forms in a personal way, responding to personal desires, indicates that He is eternally a person and manifests His different transcendental bodies as an expression of His own eternal nature. The word vi\u015buddha-j\u00f1\u0101na-m\u016brtaye is most significant. M\u016brti means the form of the Deity, and it is specifically stated here that the Lord\u2019s form is itself completely pure consciousness. Consciousness is the primary spiritual element, distinct from any of the material elements, and even distinct from the subtle or psychological material elements \u2014 mundane mind, intelligence and false ego \u2014 which are simply a psychic covering over pure consciousness. Since the Lord\u2019s form is made of pure consciousness, it can hardly be understood as a material body like the mortal bags of flesh and bones we carry around in this world. In the last two lines of this verse, there is poetic emphasis on the word sarva, \u201ceverything.\u201d The Lord is everything: He is the seed of everything and He is the Soul of every creature. Therefore, let us join with Indra in offering our obeisances to the Lord."

Unfortunately, modern man has created a hell on earth in his cynical rejection of heaven on earth, which is actually possible through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The situation described here, created simply by the auspicious bathing ceremony of the Lord, is an authentic historical incident. Since history repeats itself, there is hope that the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement may again bring the world community to the brilliant reality of self-realized existence."
