Then, simply by the feel of his palms, the blindfolded boy would have to guess who the other boy was. In all such games the boys put up stakes for the winner, such as flutes or walking sticks. Sometimes the boys would imitate the various fighting methods of the forest animals, and at other times they would chirp like birds."

Also because the demon had appeared as a cowherd boyfriend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s and because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had accepted him as a friend, Baladeva was slightly apprehensive about killing him. Balar\u0101ma could also have been worried that since this cowherd boy was actually a demon in disguise, at that very moment another such demon might have been attacking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Thus the omniscient and omnipotent Supreme Lord Balar\u0101ma exhibited the pastime of becoming slightly nervous in the presence of the horrible demon Pralamba."
