        "translation": "King Par\u012bk\u1e63it said: My lord, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, all the various activities exhibited by the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are certainly pleasing to the ear and to the mind. Simply by one\u2019s hearing of these activities, the dirty things in one\u2019s mind immediately vanish. Generally we are reluctant to hear about the activities of the Lord, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s childhood activities are so attractive that they are automatically pleasing to the mind and ear. Thus one\u2019s attachment for hearing about material things, which is the root cause of material existence, vanishes, and one gradually develops devotional service to the Supreme Lord, attachment for Him, and friendship with devotees who give us the contribution of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If you think it fit, kindly speak about those activities of the Lord.",
        "purport": " As stated in the Prema-vivarta: Our material existence is m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, in which we desire different varieties of material enjoyment and therefore change to different varieties of bodies (bhr\u0101mayan sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni yantr\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101ni m\u0101yay\u0101). Asann api kle\u015bada \u0101sa deha\u1e25: as long as we have these temporary bodies, they give us many varieties of tribulation \u2014 \u0101dhy\u0101tmika, \u0101dhibhautika and \u0101dhidaivika. This is the root cause of all suffering, but this root cause of suffering can be removed by revival of our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. All the Vedic literatures presented by Vy\u0101sadeva and other great sages are therefore intended to revive our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which begins to revive with \u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtanam: \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.17). \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and other Vedic literatures exist simply to give us a chance to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has different avat\u0101ras, or incarnations, all of which are wonderful and which arouse one\u2019s inquisitiveness, but generally such avat\u0101ras as Matsya, K\u016brma and Var\u0101ha are not as attractive as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. First of all, however, we have no attraction for hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this is the root cause of our suffering. But Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja specifically mentions that the wonderful activities of baby K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which amazed mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and the other inhabitants of Vraja, are especially attractive. From the very beginning of His childhood, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a killed P\u016btan\u0101, T\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101varta and \u015aaka\u1e6d\u0101sura and showed the entire universe within His mouth. Thus the pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one after another, kept mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and all the inhabitants of Vraja in great astonishment. The process to revive one\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is \u0101dau \u015braddh\u0101 tata\u1e25 s\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45ga\u1e25 (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.4.15). The pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be properly received from devotees. If one has developed a little bit of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by hearing from Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas about the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one becomes attached to Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas who are interested only in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja recommends that one hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s childhood activities, which are more attractive than the activities of other incarnations, such as Matsya, K\u016brma and Var\u0101ha. Wanting to hear more and more from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it requested him to continue describing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s childhood activities, which are especially easy to hear and which create more and more inquisitiveness."

        "purport": " There is no question of overpopulation or of children\u2019s being a burden for their parents in a Vedic society. Such a society is so well organized and people are so advanced in spiritual consciousness that childbirth is never regarded as a burden or a botheration. The more a child grows, the more his parents become jubilant, and the child\u2019s attempts to turn over are also a source of jubilation. Even before the child is born, when the mother is pregnant, many recommended ritualistic ceremonies are performed. For example, when the child has been within the womb for three months and for seven months, there is a ceremony the mother observes by eating with neighboring children. This ceremony is called sv\u0101da-bhak\u1e63a\u1e47a. Similarly, before the birth of the child there is the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na ceremony. In Vedic civilization, childbirth or pregnancy is never regarded as a burden; rather, it is a cause for jubilation. In contrast, people in modern civilization do not like pregnancy or childbirth, and when there is a child, they sometimes kill it. We can just consider how human society has fallen since the inauguration of Kali-yuga. Although people still claim to be civilized, at the present moment there is actually no human civilization, but only an assembly of two-legged animals."

Now, on the plea of demanding to suck His mother\u2019s breast, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took this opportunity to kill the demon. Thus He kicked \u015aaka\u1e6d\u0101sura just to expose him.

On the cart there were many little utensils made of various metals, and all of them scattered hither and thither.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has commented on this verse as follows. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was of a very tender age, His hands and legs resembled soft new leaves, yet simply by touching the handcart with His legs, He made the cart fall to pieces. It was quite possible for Him to act in this way and yet not exert Himself very much. The Lord in His V\u0101mana avat\u0101ra had to extend His foot to the greatest height to penetrate the covering of the universe, and when the Lord killed the gigantic demon Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, He had to assume the special bodily feature of N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva. But in His K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a avat\u0101ra, the Lord did not need to exert such energy. Therefore, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. In other incarnations, the Lord had to exert some energy according to the time and circumstances, but in this form He exhibited unlimited potency. Thus the handcart collapsed, its joints broken, and all the metal pots and utensils scattered. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b remarks that although the handcart was higher than the child, the child could easily touch the wheel of the cart, and this was sufficient to send the demon down to the earth. The Lord simultaneously pushed the demon to the earth and superficially broke the handcart."

At that time, the small children present asserted that the cart had been kicked apart by the baby K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As soon as the crying baby had kicked the cart\u2019s wheel, the cart had collapsed. There was no doubt about it.",
        "purport": " We have heard of people\u2019s being haunted by ghosts. Having no gross material body, a ghost seeks shelter of a gross body to stay in and haunt. The \u015aaka\u1e6d\u0101sura was a ghost who had taken shelter of the handcart and was looking for the opportunity to do mischief to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a kicked the cart with His small and very delicate legs, the ghost was immediately pushed down to the earth and his shelter dismantled, as already described. This was possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He has full potency, as confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.32): K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, or \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa-vigraha. That is, any of the parts of His \u0101nanda-cinmaya body can act for any other part. Such are the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord does not need to acquire these potencies; He already has them. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a kicked His little legs, and His whole purpose was fulfilled. Also, when the handcart broke, an ordinary child could have been injured in many ways, but because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He enjoyed the dismantling of the cart, and nothing injured Him. Everything done by Him is \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa, full transcendental bliss. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually enjoyed. The nearby children saw that actually K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had kicked the wheel of the cart and this was how the accident happened. By the arrangement of Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, all the gop\u012bs and gopas thought that the accident had taken place because of some bad planet or some ghost, but in fact everything was done by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and enjoyed by Him. Those who enjoy the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are also on the platform of \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa; they are liberated from the material platform. When one develops the practice of hearing k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, he is certainly transcendental to material existence, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (sa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate). Unless one is on the spiritual platform, one cannot enjoy the transcendental activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; or in other words, whoever engages in hearing the transcendental activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not on the material platform, but on the transcendental, spiritual platform."

Considering this, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja soberly took K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on his lap and invited such truthful br\u0101hma\u1e47as to perform a ritualistic ceremony according to the holy hymns of the S\u0101ma Veda, \u1e5ag Veda and Yajur Veda. Then, while the hymns were being chanted, he bathed the child with water mixed with pure herbs, and after performing a fire ceremony, he sumptuously fed all the br\u0101hma\u1e47as with first-class grains and other food.",
        "purport": " Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was very confident about the qualifications of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and their blessings. He was fully confident that simply if the good br\u0101hma\u1e47as showered their blessings, the child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would be happy. The blessings of qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as can bring happiness not only to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but to everyone. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is self-sufficient, He does not require anyone\u2019s blessings, yet Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja thought that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a required the blessings of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. What then is to be said of others? In human society, therefore, there must be an ideal class of men, br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who can bestow blessings upon others, namely, upon the k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras, so that everyone will be happy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13) that human society must have four social orders (c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25); it is not that everyone should become a \u015b\u016bdra or a vai\u015bya and human society will prosper. As enunciated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, there must be a class of br\u0101hma\u1e47as with qualities like satya (truthfulness), \u015bama (peacefulness), dama (self-control) and titik\u1e63\u0101 (tolerance). Here also, in the Bh\u0101gavatam, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja invites qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as. There may be caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and we have all respect for them, but their birth in br\u0101hma\u1e47a families does not mean that they are qualified to bestow blessings upon the other members of human society. This is the verdict of the \u015b\u0101stras. In Kali-yuga, caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as are accepted as br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Vipratve s\u016btram eva hi (Bh\u0101g. 12.2.3): in Kali-yuga, simply by putting on a thread worth two paise, one becomes a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Such br\u0101hma\u1e47as were not called for by Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. As stated by N\u0101rada Muni (Bh\u0101g. 7.11.35), yasya yal lak\u1e63a\u1e47a\u1e41 proktam. The symptoms of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a are stated in \u015b\u0101stra, and one must be qualified with these symptoms. The blessings of br\u0101hma\u1e47as who are not envious, disturbed or puffed up with pride and false prestige and who are fully qualified with truthfulness will be useful. Therefore a class of men must be trained as br\u0101hma\u1e47as from the very beginning. Brahmac\u0101r\u012b gurukule vasan d\u0101nto guror hitam (Bh\u0101g. 7.12.1). The word d\u0101nta\u1e25 is very important. D\u0101nta\u1e25 refers to one who is not envious, disturbing or puffed up with false prestige. With the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, we are trying to introduce such br\u0101hma\u1e47as in society. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as must ultimately be Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, and if one is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he has already acquired the qualifications of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101 (Bg. 18.54). The word brahma-bh\u016bta refers to becoming a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or understanding what is Brahman (brahma j\u0101n\u0101t\u012bti br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u1e25). One who is brahma-bh\u016bta is always happy (prasann\u0101tm\u0101). Na \u015bocati na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati: he is never disturbed about material necessities. Sama\u1e25 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u: he is ready to bestow blessings upon everyone equally. Mad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m: then he becomes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. In this age, \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura introduced the sacred thread ceremony for his Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava disciples, with the idea that people should understand that when one becomes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava he has already acquired the qualifications of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Therefore in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, those who are twice initiated so as to become br\u0101hma\u1e47as must bear in mind their great responsibility to be truthful, control the mind and senses, be tolerant, and so on. Then their life will be successful. It was such br\u0101hma\u1e47as that Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja invited to chant the Vedic hymns, not ordinary br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Verse 13 distinctly mentions hi\u1e41s\u0101-m\u0101na. The word m\u0101na refers to false prestige or false pride. Those who were falsely proud, thinking that they were br\u0101hma\u1e47as because they were born in br\u0101hma\u1e47a families, were never invited by Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja on such occasions. Verse 14 mentions pavitrau\u1e63adhi. In any ritualistic ceremony, many herbs and leaves were required. These were known as pavitra-patra. Sometimes there were nimba leaves, sometimes bael leaves, mango leaves, a\u015bvattha leaves or \u0101malak\u012b leaves. Similarly, there were pa\u00f1ca-gavya, pa\u00f1ca-\u015basya and pa\u00f1ca-ratna. Although Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja belonged to the vai\u015bya community, everything was known to him. The most important word in these verses is mah\u0101-gu\u1e47am, indicating that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were offered very palatable food of exalted quality. Such palatable dishes were generally prepared with two things, namely food grains and milk products. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.44) therefore enjoins that human society must give protection to the cows and encourage agriculture (k\u1e5b\u1e63i-go-rak\u1e63ya-v\u0101\u1e47ijya\u1e41 vai\u015bya-karma svabh\u0101vajam). Simply by expert cooking, hundreds and thousands of palatable dishes can be prepared from agricultural produce and milk products. This is indicated here by the words anna\u1e41 mah\u0101-gu\u1e47am. Still today in India, from these two things, namely food grains and milk, hundreds and thousands of varieties of food are prepared, and then they are offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (Catur-vidha-\u015br\u012b-bhagavat-pras\u0101da. Patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toya\u1e41 yo me bhakty\u0101 prayacchati.) Then the pras\u0101da is distributed. Even today in Jagann\u0101tha-k\u1e63etra and other big temples, very palatable dishes are offered to the Deity, and pras\u0101da is distributed profusely. Cooked by first-class br\u0101hma\u1e47as with expert knowledge and then distributed to the public, this pras\u0101da is also a blessing from the br\u0101hma\u1e47as or Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. There are four kinds of pras\u0101da (catur-vidha). Salty, sweet, sour and pungent tastes are made with different types of spices, and the food is prepared in four divisions, called carvya, c\u016b\u1e63ya, lehya and peya \u2014 pras\u0101da that is chewed, pras\u0101da that is licked, pras\u0101da tasted with the tongue, and pras\u0101da that is drunk. Thus there are many varieties of pras\u0101da, prepared very nicely with grains and ghee, offered to the Deity and distributed to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and then to the general public. This is the way of human society. Killing the cows and spoiling the land will not solve the problem of food. This is not civilization. Uncivilized men living in the jungle and being unqualified to produce food by agriculture and cow protection may eat animals, but a perfect human society advanced in knowledge must learn how to produce first-class food simply by agriculture and protection of cows."

Here also we see that T\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101varta assumed the mahim\u0101-siddhi and took K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a away as if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were an ordinary child. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also became a mystic mahim\u0101-siddha. When mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was carrying Him, He became so heavy that His mother, who was usually accustomed to carrying Him, could not bear Him and had to place Him down on the ground. Thus T\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101varta had been able to take K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a away in the presence of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. But when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, high in the sky, assumed the mahim\u0101-siddhi, the demon, unable to go further, was obliged to stop his force and come down according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s desire. One should not, therefore, compete with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mystic power. Devotees automatically have all mystic power, but they do not like to compete with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Instead, they fully surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and their yogic power is demonstrated by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy. Devotees can show mystic yoga so powerful that a demon could not even dream of it, but they never try to demonstrate it for their personal sense gratification. Whatever they do is for the service of the Lord, and therefore they are always in a position superior to that of the demons. There are many karm\u012bs, yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who artificially try to compete with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus ordinary, foolish people who do not care to hear \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from authorities consider some rascal yog\u012b to be Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the present moment there are many so-called b\u0101b\u0101s who present themselves as incarnations of God by showing some insignificant mystic wonder, and foolish people regard them as God because of lacking knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "translation": "It is most astonishing that although this innocent child was taken away by the R\u0101k\u1e63asa to be eaten, He has returned without having been killed or even injured. Because this demon was envious, cruel and sinful, he has been killed for his own sinful activities. This is the law of nature. An innocent devotee is always protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a sinful person is always vanquished for his sinful life.",
        "purport": " K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious life means innocent devotional life, and a s\u0101dhu is one who is fully devoted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As confirmed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.30), bhajate m\u0101\u1e41 ananya-bh\u0101k s\u0101dhur eva sa mantavya\u1e25: anyone fully attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a s\u0101dhu. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and the gop\u012bs and other cowherd men could not understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing as a human child and that His life was not in danger under any circumstances. Rather, because of their intense parental love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they thought that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was an innocent child and had been saved by the Supreme Lord. In the material world, because of intense lust and desire for enjoyment, one becomes implicated in sinful life more and more (k\u0101ma e\u1e63a krodha e\u1e63a rajo-gu\u1e47a-samudbhava\u1e25). Therefore the quality of fear is one of the aspects of material life (\u0101h\u0101ra-nidr\u0101-bhaya-maithuna\u1e41 ca). But if one becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, the process of devotional service, \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtanam, diminishes one\u2019s polluted life of material existence, and one is purified and protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana\u1e25. In devotional life, one has faith in this process. Such faith is one of the six kinds of surrender. Rak\u1e63i\u1e63yat\u012bti vi\u015bv\u0101sa\u1e25 (Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa 11.676). One of the processes of surrender is that one should simply depend on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, convinced that He will give one all protection. That K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will protect His devotee is a fact, and Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and the other inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana accepted this very simply, although they did not know that the Supreme Lord Himself was present before them. There have been many instances in which a devotee like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja or Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja has been put in difficulty even by his father but has been saved under all circumstances. Therefore our only business is to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and depend fully on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for all protection."

        "translation": "When mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 saw the whole universe within the mouth of her child, her heart began to throb, and in astonishment she wanted to close her restless eyes.",
        "purport": " Because of her pure maternal love, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 thought that this wonderful child playing so many tricks must have had some disease. She did not appreciate the wonders shown by her child; rather, she wanted to close her eyes. She was expecting another danger, and therefore her eyes became restless like those of a deer cub. This was all the arrangement of Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. The relationship between mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is one of pure maternal love. In that love, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 did not very much appreciate the display of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s opulences. At the beginning of this chapter, two extra verses sometimes appear: \u201cIn this way, to chastise and kill the demons, the child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a demonstrated many activities in the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and the inhabitants of Vraja enjoyed these incidents.\u201d \u201cTo increase the transcendental pleasure of the gopas and the gop\u012bs, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the killer of all demons, was thus raised by His father and mother, Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101.\u201d \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da Vijayadhvaja T\u012brtha also adds another verse after the third verse in this chapter: \u201cPar\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja then requested \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b to continue speaking such narrations about the pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, so that the King could enjoy from them transcendental bliss.\u201d"
