But afterwards, when they had returned to their homes, perplexity arose within their hearts. Thus they thought,\u00a0\u2018Now we have directly seen child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a lift Govardhana Hill, and we remember how He killed P\u016btan\u0101 and other demons, extinguished the forest fire, and so on. At the time, we thought that these extraordinary acts occurred because of a benediction from the br\u0101hma\u1e47as or because of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s great fortune, or that perhaps this boy had achieved the mercy of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and was thus empowered by Him. \u201c\u2018But all these presumptions are false, because an ordinary seven-year old boy could never hold up the king of mountains for seven whole days. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not a human being. He must be the Supreme Lord Himself. \u201c\u2018But on the other hand, child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loves it when we coddle Him, and He becomes morose when we \u2014 His uncles and well-wishers, simply worldly cowherd men \u2014 do not give Him attention. He appears to become hungry and thirsty, steals yogurt and milk, sometimes plays tricks, tells lies, chatters childishly and tends the calves. If He is actually the Supreme Lord, why would He do these things? Don\u2019t they indicate that He is an ordinary human child? \u201c\u2018We are totally unable to establish the truth of His identity. Therefore let us go and inquire from the highly intelligent King of Vraja, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and he shall free us from our doubts.\u2019\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the cowherd men thus made up their minds, and then they entered Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s great assembly hall and questioned him as described in the following verse."

        "purport": " The very word k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means \u201cthe all-attractive one.\u201d The residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana could not give up their constant love (anur\u0101ga) for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Their attitude toward Him was not particularly theistic, because they were unsure whether He was God or not. But He attracted all their love precisely because as God He is the all-attractive person, the supreme object of our love. The cowherd men also asked, \u201cHow is it that young K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a feels such constant love for us?\u201d In fact the Supreme Lord loves all living beings, who are eternally His children. At the end of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a dramatically declares His affection for Arjuna and urges Arjuna to reciprocate that love by surrendering to Him. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in His prayers to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, states, et\u0101d\u1e5b\u015b\u012b tava k\u1e5bp\u0101 bhagavan mam\u0101pi durdaivam \u012bd\u1e5b\u015bam ih\u0101jani n\u0101nur\u0101ga\u1e25: \u201cMy Lord, You are so merciful toward Me, but I am so unfortunate that love for You has not awakened within Me.\u201d (\u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka 2) In this statement \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also uses the word anur\u0101ga. Our misfortune is that we cannot reciprocate the anur\u0101ga, or loving affection, that the Lord feels for us. Although we are infinitesimal and insignificant and the Lord is infinitely attractive, somehow we do not give Him our love. We must accept responsibility for this foolish decision, since to surrender to God or not is the essential expression of our free will. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement provides an efficient, systematic program to help conditioned souls revive their original, blissful consciousness, which is love of God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The intricacies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are so wonderful that even K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s eternal associates, the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, are astonished by them, as shown by these verses."

It is apparent from this and the previous verses in this chapter that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lifting of Govardhana Hill made quite an impression on the simple cowherd men of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and they repeatedly remembered this feat.

That is the rational conclusion one should come to after reading this chapter."
