        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b explains that because activities such as those described in this verse do not occur in any other world, the earth is unique. In fact, the earth\u2019s glories are being spread by wonderful V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana because it is the place of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes. The name Devak\u012b also refers to mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, as stated in the B\u1e5bhad-vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cThe wife of Nanda had two names, Ya\u015bod\u0101 and also Devak\u012b. Therefore it was natural that she [the wife of Nanda] develop friendship with Devak\u012b, the wife of \u015aauri [Vasudeva].\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-l\u012bl\u0101 as follows: \u201cIn V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the peacocks request K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u00a0\u2018Govinda, please make us dance.\u2019 Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a plays His flute, and they surround Him in a circle and dance in time with the rhythm of His melody. And while standing in the midst of their dancing, He also sings and dances. Then those peacocks, who are fully satisfied with His musical performance, out of gratitude offer for His pleasure their own divine feathers. In the usual manner of musical performers, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gladly accepts these presentations and places a feather upon the turban atop His head. Gentle animals such as deer and doves greatly relish the transcendental entertainment presented by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and to get a good view they flock to the peaks of hills. Then, as they watch the breathtaking program, they become stunned in ecstasy.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b comments that because in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a goes barefoot and can thus directly mark the earth with the symbols of His lotus feet, that transcendental land is even more glorious than Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, where Vi\u1e63\u1e47u wears slippers."

Also, it is significant that the gop\u012bs knew about the different kinds of airplanes flying in the sky.\u201d In fact, even while sitting on the laps of their demigod husbands, the demigoddesses became agitated by hearing the sounds of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute.

The gop\u012bs also considered that the demigods, although noting their wives\u2019 attraction to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, did not become envious. The demigods are actually very refined in culture and intelligence, and therefore when flying in their airplanes they regularly take their wives along to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The gop\u012bs thought, \u201cOur husbands, on the other hand, are envious.

Significantly, it is stated here that even great sages become maddened by the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute, which is a completely spiritual vibration. The word rucira-prav\u0101l\u0101n indicates that even the branches of the trees are transformed in ecstasy when struck by the vibration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute-song. Indra, Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, being primordial gods, travel throughout the universe and have extensive knowledge of the science of music, and yet even these great personalities have never heard or composed music like that which emanates from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute. Indeed, the birds are so moved by the blissful sound that in their ecstasy they close their eyes and cling to the branches to avoid falling off the trees. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that the gop\u012bs would sometimes address each other as amba, \u201cmother.\u201d"

So the lusty aborigine girls, while looking toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a playing His flute, saw the reddish ku\u1e45kuma on the ground and immediately took it and smeared it over their faces and breasts.

O my friends, this hill supplies K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma, along with Their calves, cows and cowherd friends, with all kinds of necessities \u2014 water for drinking, very soft grass, caves, fruits, flowers and vegetables. In this way the hill offers respects to the Lord. Being touched by the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma, Govardhana Hill appears very jubilant.",

Govardhana also offers other beverages, such as honey, mango juice and p\u012blu juice. S\u016byavasa indicates d\u016brv\u0101 grass, used to make the religious offering of arghya. Govardhana also has grass that is fragrant, soft and conducive to the strong growth of cows and increased production of milk. Thus this grass is used for feeding the transcendental herds. Kandara refers to the caves where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Balar\u0101ma and Their friends play, sit and lie down. These caves give pleasure when the weather is too hot or too cold, or when it is raining. Govardhana also features soft roots for eating, jewels for ornamenting the body, flat places for sitting, and lamps and mirrors in the form of smooth stones, glistening water and other natural substances."

The gop\u012bs were not born in very high br\u0101hma\u1e47a or k\u1e63atriya families; they were born in the families of vai\u015byas, and not in big mercantile communities but in the families of cowherd men.
