        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that if anyone offers Him a leaf, a fruit, a flower or some water, He will immediately accept it. The only condition is that these things should be offered with bhakti (yo me bhakty\u0101 prayacchati). Otherwise, if one is puffed up with false prestige, thinking, \u201cI have so much opulence, and I am giving something to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d one\u2019s offering will not be accepted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The fruit vendor, although a woman belonging to the poor aborigine class, dealt with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with great affection, saying, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, You have come to me to take some fruit in exchange for grains. All the grains have fallen, but still You may take whatever You like.\u201d Thus she filled K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s palms with whatever fruits He could carry. In exchange, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a filled her whole basket with jewels and gold. From this incident one should learn that for anything offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with love and affection, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can reciprocate many millions of times over, both materially and spiritually. The basic principle involved is an exchange of love. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a teaches in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.27): \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.\u201d With love and affection, one should try to give something to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from one\u2019s source of income. Then one\u2019s life will be successful. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full in all opulences; He does not need anything from anyone. But if one is prepared to give something to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is for one\u2019s own benefit. The example given in this connection is that when one\u2019s real face is decorated, the reflection of one\u2019s face is automatically decorated. Similarly, if we try to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with all our opulences, we, as parts and parcels or reflections of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, will become happy in exchange. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always happy, for He is \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma, fully satisfied with His own opulence."

Now let us leave this place and go someplace where we may worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u undisturbed, before there is another cause of death from some demon who may attack us.\u201d A devotee desires only that he may execute devotional service undisturbed.

Of course, in every case, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came out victorious. The instruction we may derive from this is that we should not be disturbed by so-called disturbances. There have been so many disturbances to our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, but we cannot give up our forward march. On the contrary, people are receiving this movement very enthusiastically all over the world, and they are purchasing literature about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with redoubled energy. Thus there are both encouragements and disturbances. This was so even in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s time."

        "purport": " Here is an instruction about the result of studying or discussing the k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-l\u012bl\u0101s that appear in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.

Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Ya\u015bod\u0101 in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana appeared like ordinary persons of this material world, but they never felt the tribulations of this world, although they sometimes met many dangerous situations created by the demons. This is a practical example. If we follow in the footsteps of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and the gopas, we can all be happy simply by discussing the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vy\u0101sadeva has given this literature so that everyone may understand one\u2019s transcendental position simply by discussing bh\u0101gavata-kath\u0101. Even at the present moment, everyone everywhere can be happy and free from material tribulations by following \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. There is no need of austerities and penances, which in this age are very difficult to perform. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has therefore declared, sarv\u0101tma-snapana\u1e41 para\u1e41 vijayate \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtanam. By our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, we are trying to distribute \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam so that anyone in any part of the world can be absorbed in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement by chanting and hearing about the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be free from all material tribulations."
