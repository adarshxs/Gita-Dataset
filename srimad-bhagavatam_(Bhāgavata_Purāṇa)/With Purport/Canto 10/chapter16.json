As Lord Caitanya advised in His \u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka, one has to execute devotional service by humbly chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street and not expecting honor for himself but offering all kinds of honor to others. The N\u0101gapatn\u012bs were astonished that, although K\u0101liya had the body of a serpent as the result of grievous sinful activities, at the same time he was in contact with the Lord to the extent that the Lord\u2019s lotus feet were touching his hoods. Certainly this was not the ordinary result of pious activities. These two contradictory facts astonished them.\u201d"

If one methodically and intelligently studies the functioning of the material qualities, he will ultimately conclude that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead and that He exhibits His illusory potency to bewilder those who do not surrender unto Him. The Lord is never affected by the modes of nature, being their witness, and thus He is called gu\u1e47a-dra\u1e63\u1e6dre.

Therefore we should take Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and immediately come to the right conclusion: full surrender to the Lord\u2019s lotus feet.

The fortunate conditioned souls are startled into remembrance of their actual position as loving servants of the Lord, and from within the heart the Lord then encourages them to come back home, back to Godhead, where time is conspicuous by its absence and where eternal, blissful existence supersedes the dramatic but disturbing functions of cosmic creation and annihilation."

Having thus pleased the Lord, whose flag is marked with the emblem of Garu\u1e0da, K\u0101liya felt satisfied. Receiving the Lord\u2019s permission to leave, K\u0101liya circumambulated Him and offered Him obeisances. Then, taking his wives, friends and children, he went to his island in the sea. The very moment K\u0101liya left, the Yamun\u0101 was immediately restored to her original condition, free from poison and full of nectarean water. This happened by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was manifesting a humanlike form to enjoy His pastimes.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has commented extensively on this verse. To explain the word ma\u1e47ibhi\u1e25 \u2014 \u201c(K\u0101liya worshiped the Lord) with jewels\u201d \u2014 the \u0101c\u0101rya has quoted from the \u015ar\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-ga\u1e47odde\u015ba-d\u012bpik\u0101, by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, as follows: \u201cThe Lord had made His Kaustubha gem enter the serpent\u2019s lake, and then He arranged for it to be presented to Himself by the hands of K\u0101liya\u2019s wives.\u201d In other words, because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to act just like an ordinary human being, He made the transcendental Kaustubha gem invisible and caused it to enter within K\u0101liya\u2019s treasury. Then when the appropriate moment came for K\u0101liya to worship the Lord with many different jewels and ornaments, the serpent\u2019s wives, unaware of the Lord\u2019s transcendental trick, presented Him with the Kaustubha gem, thinking it was simply one of the jewels in their possession. The \u0101c\u0101rya has further commented that the reason Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described in this verse as garu\u1e0da-dhvaja, \u201cHe whose flag is marked by the symbol of His carrier, Garu\u1e0da,\u201d is that K\u0101liya also desired to become Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s carrier. Garu\u1e0da and the serpents are originally related as brothers, and therefore K\u0101liya wanted to indicate to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cIf You ever have to go to a distant place, You should also think of me as Your personal carrier. I am the servant of Your servant, and in the wink of an eye I can travel hundreds of millions of yojanas.\u201d Thus the Pur\u0101\u1e47as narrate that in the course of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s eternal cycle of pastimes, when Ka\u1e41sa orders the Lord to come to Mathur\u0101, He sometimes goes there mounted upon K\u0101liya."
