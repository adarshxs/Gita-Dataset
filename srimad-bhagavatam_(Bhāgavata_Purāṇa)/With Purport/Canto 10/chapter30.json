You are eager to realize the ecstasy of seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus your eyes are following Him. In fact, He is never lost to you.\u2019 \u201cThen the gop\u012bs, seeing the doe continue to walk in her natural way, exclaimed, \u2018Oh, are you telling us that you have seen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? Look! As this deer walks she constantly turns her head back to us, as if to say, \u201cI will show Him to you; just follow me and I will show you K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d In this merciless V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, she is the only merciful person.\u2019 \u201cAs the gop\u012bs follow the doe they happen to lose sight of her, and they cry out, \u2018Oh, why can\u2019t we see the deer who is showing us the way to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a?\u2019 \u201cOne gop\u012b suggests that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must be somewhere in the vicinity and that the deer, being afraid of Him, must have hidden herself to avoid the possible mistake of revealing His presence. Conjecturing in this way, the gop\u012bs detect a fragrance that has by chance blown their way, and they repeatedly declare with great joy, \u2018Yes! Yes! This is it! By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s physical contact with His girlfriend, His jasmine garland was smeared with the ku\u1e45kuma powder on Her breasts, and the fragrances of all these things are reaching us.\u2019 Thus the gop\u012bs smelled the aroma of the two lovers\u2019 bodies, of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s jasmine garland, and of the cosmetic powder on the breasts of His lover.\u201d"

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, in his commentary on this verse, gives the following scriptural information about the symbolic markings on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u201cIn the following verses the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a states the particular places on His feet where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a carries the mark of the flag and also other marks, and the reasons for these marks: \u2018At the base of the large toe on His right foot, the unborn Lord carries the mark of a disc, which cuts down the six [mental] enemies of His devotees.\u2019 \u2018At the bottom of the middle toe of that same foot Lord Acyuta has a lotus flower, which increases the greed for Him in the minds of the beelike devotees who meditate on His feet.\u2019 \u2018At the base of His small toe is a thunderbolt, which smashes the mountains of His devotees\u2019 reactions to past sins, and in the middle of His heel is the mark of an elephant goad, which brings the elephants of His devotees\u2019 minds under control.\u2019 \u2018The joint of His right large toe bears the mark of a barleycorn, representing all kinds of enjoyable opulences.\u2019 \u201cThe Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a also states: \u2018A thunderbolt is found on the right side of His right foot, and an elephant goad below that.\u2019 \u201cThe \u0101c\u0101ryas of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava samprad\u0101ya explain that since the particular feet under discussion are Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, we should know that the thunderbolt is at the base of His small toe and the elephant goad below the thunderbolt. An elephant goad on the heel belongs rather to Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and other vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva expansions. \u201cThus the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a describes six marks on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s right foot \u2014 the disc, flag, lotus, thunderbolt, elephant goad and barleycorn. And the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b mentions even more marks \u2014 a vertical line beginning at the middle of His foot and continuing as far as the juncture between His big toe and second toe; an umbrella below the disc; at the base of the middle of His foot, a group of four svastikas in the four cardinal directions; at the four points where each svastika meets the next, four rose apples; and in the middle of the svastikas, an octagon. This makes eleven marks on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s right foot.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b describes the marks on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s left foot as follows: \u201cAt the base of the large toe is a conchshell with its mouth facing the toe. At the base of the middle toe are two concentric circles, representing the inner and outer sky. Below this mark is Cupid\u2019s unstrung bow, at the base of the bow is a triangle, and surrounding the triangle is a group of four waterpots. At the base of the triangle is a half-moon with two more triangles touching its points, and below the half-moon is a fish. \u201cAll together, then, there are nineteen distinguishing marks on the soles of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet.\u201d"

That he has spoken Her name is indeed Her mercy, and thus the word \u0101r\u0101dhita\u1e25 is like the rumbling of a kettledrum sounded to announce Her great good fortune.\u201d Although the gop\u012bs spoke as if jealous of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, they were actually ecstatic to see that She had captured \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b quotes the following detailed description of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s footprints, as given by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his \u015ar\u012b Ujjvala-n\u012blama\u1e47i: \u201cAt the base of the large toe of Her left foot is the mark of a barleycorn, below that mark is a disc, below the disc is an umbrella, and below the umbrella is a bracelet. A vertical line extends from the middle of Her foot to the juncture of Her large and second toes. At the base of the middle toe is a lotus, below that is a flag with a banner, and below the flag is a creeper, together with a flower. At the base of Her small toe is an elephant goad, and upon Her heel is a half-moon. Thus there are eleven marks on Her left foot. \u201cAt the base of the large toe of Her right foot is a conchshell, and below that a spear. At the base of the small toe of Her right foot is a sacrificial altar, below that an earring, and below the earring a club. Along the base of the second, third, fourth and small toes is the mark of a mountain, below which is a chariot, and on the heel is a fish. \u201cThus all together there are nineteen distinguishing marks on the soles of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s lotus feet.\u201d"

        "purport": " This verse directly refutes the superficial criticism materialistic people sometimes direct against Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes. The philosopher Aristotle claimed that ordinary activities are unworthy of God, and with this idea in mind some people declare that since the activities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a resemble those of ordinary human beings, He cannot be the Absolute Truth. But in this verse \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b emphatically points out that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a acts on the liberated platform of spiritual self-satisfaction. This fact is indicated here by the terms \u0101tma-rata, \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma and akha\u1e47\u1e0dita. It is inconceivable to ordinary people that a handsome young boy and a beautiful young girl enjoying romantic conjugal affairs in the forest moonlight can be engaging in pure activity, free from egoistic desire and lust. Yet while Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is inconceivable to ordinary persons, those who love Him can easily realize the absolute, pure nature of His activities. One may argue that \u201cbeauty is in the eye of the beholder\u201d and that therefore the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are only imagining the Lord\u2019s activities to be pure. This argument ignores many significant facts. For one, the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, of developing love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, demands that a devotee strictly follow four regulative principles: no illicit sex, no gambling, no intoxication and no eating of meat, fish or eggs. When one is freed from material lust and rises to the liberated platform, beyond material desire, one realizes the absolute beauty of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This process is not theoretical: it has been practiced and completed by many thousands of great sages, who have left us their shining example and their brilliant teachings concerning the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Certainly beauty is in the eye of the beholder. However, real beauty is perceived by the soul\u2019s eye and not by the lusty eye of the material body. Therefore the Vedic literature repeatedly stresses that only those freed from material desire can see the beauty of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with the eye of the pure soul, anointed with love of Godhead. It may finally be noted that upon realizing the pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one becomes free of all tinges of sex desire, a state of mind that can hardly result from meditating upon material sexual affairs. One final note: The conjugal pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a perfectly round out His qualification as the Supreme Absolute Truth. The Ved\u0101nta states that the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, so certainly the Absolute cannot lack any of the beautiful things of this world. It is only because romantic affairs exist in a pure, spiritual form in the Absolute that they can manifest in a perverted, material form in this world. Thus the apparent beauty of this world is not to be absolutely rejected; rather, beauty should be accepted in its pure, spiritual form. Since the beginning of time men and women have been inspired to poetic rapture by the art of romance. Unfortunately, romance in this world usually leads to crushing disappointment, brought about by a change of heart or by death. Thus although we may at first find romantic affairs beautiful and enjoyable, they are eventually spoiled by the onslaught of material nature. Still, it is unreasonable to totally reject the concept of romance. Rather, we should accept conjugal attraction in its absolute, perfect, pure form, as it exists within God, without a tinge of material lust or selfishness. That pure conjugal attraction \u2014 the supreme beauty and pleasure of the Supreme Truth \u2014 is what we are reading about here in the pages of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

Even with the greatest endeavor I cannot maintain My life. But You are the Lord of My life, and so You can quickly save Me simply by glancing upon Me. Please do so immediately.

After giving up all the other gop\u012bs, You\u2019ve brought Me so far to a secluded place in the forest just to enjoy special pleasure with Me. If I die You will not be able to find conjugal happiness anywhere else. You will remember Me and thus lament in Your sorrow.\u2019 \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a replies, \u2018So let Me become unhappy. What does that matter to You?\u2019 \u201c\u2018But You are most dear to Me. I will feel Your unhappiness millions of times more than You. Even if I\u2019ve already died, I still will not be able to tolerate the pain that even one spot on the nails of Your lotus feet may experience. Indeed, to prevent such pain I am ready to throw My life away millions and millions of times. So kindly show Yourself and drive away that unhappiness.\u2019 \u201c\u2018But if Your life air is on the verge of leaving Your body, what can I do to stop that?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Simply by the touch of Your arms, which are a medicinal herb with the power to revive the dead, My body will return to its healthy, normal condition, and My life air will automatically come back and remain in My body.\u2019 \u201c\u2018But You know the forest path Yourself without My help, so why did You order Me, the king\u2019s son and a very young and gentle boy who is to be respected? Why did You command, \u201cTake Me wherever You wish\u201d? Why do You anger Me like this?\u2019 \u201cR\u0101dh\u0101 cries out, \u2018Please show Yourself to Your wretched maidservant. Be merciful to Me! Be merciful! When I ordered You, I was overcome by sleepiness. I was so tired from playing with You. Therefore please excuse what Your poor servant said. Please don\u2019t be angry. It was only because You treated Me like such a close friend, though I am unworthy, that I spoke like that to You.\u2019 \u201c\u2018All right, My love, I am very pleased with You, so please come to Me.\u2019 \u201c\u2018But I\u2019ve been blinded by lamentation.
