        "purport": " Before beginning his commentary on this chapter, \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cI worship Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, within whose mouth reside the great masters of eloquence, upon whose chest resides the goddess of fortune, and within whose heart resides the divine potency of consciousness.\u201d \u201cDesiring to purify my samprad\u0101ya and being bound by duty, I will briefly comment on the prayers of the personified Vedas, to the best of my realization.\u201d \u201cIn as much as \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam has already been perfectly honored by my predecessors\u2019 explanations, I can only gather together the remnants of what they have honored.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b offers his own invocation: \u201cThe saintly devotees may laugh at me for becoming a jewel merchant though I know nothing about precious jewels. But I feel no shame, for at least I may entertain them.\u201d \u201cThough I have no wisdom, devotion or detachment, I am still greedy to take the philosopher\u2019s stone of the Vedas\u2019 prayers from the fortress in which it is being kept.\u201d \u201cIf the wind of indiscretion \u2014 my failure to acknowledge my lowly position \u2014 threatens to knock me down, then while writing this commentary I must hold on to the effulgent pillars of the feet of \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d \u201cRepeatedly bowing down to my divine spiritual master and to Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the ocean of mercy, I take shelter of \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the protector of the world and its universal eye.\u201d At the end of the preceding chapter, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b told Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja: \u201cThus, O King, the Personality of Godhead, who is the devotee of His own devotees, stayed for some time with His two great devotees, teaching them how perfect saints behave. Then He returned to Dv\u0101rak\u0101.\u201d In this verse the word san-m\u0101rgam can be understood in at least three ways. In the first, sat is taken to mean \u201cdevotee of the Supreme Lord,\u201d and thus san-m\u0101rgam means \u201cthe path of bhakti-yoga, devotional service.\u201d In the second, with sat meaning \u201ca seeker of transcendental knowledge,\u201d san-m\u0101rgam means \u201cthe philosophical path of knowledge,\u201d which has impersonal Brahman as its object. And in the third, with sat referring to the transcendental sound of the Vedas, san-m\u0101rgam means \u201cthe process of following Vedic injunctions.\u201d Both the second and the third of these interpretations of san-m\u0101rgam lead to the question of how the Vedas can describe the Absolute Truth. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b elaborately analyzes this problem in terms of the traditional discipline of Sanskrit poetics: We should consider that words have three kinds of expressive capacities, called \u015babda-v\u1e5bttis. These are the different ways a word refers to its meaning, distinguished as mukhya-v\u1e5btti, lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101-v\u1e5btti and gau\u1e47a-v\u1e5btti. The \u015babda-v\u1e5btti termed mukhya is the primary, literal meaning of a word; this is also known as abhidh\u0101, a word\u2019s \u201cdenotation,\u201d or dictionary meaning. Mukhya-v\u1e5btti is further divided into two subcategories, namely r\u016b\u1e0dhi and yoga. A primary meaning is called r\u016b\u1e0dhi when it is based on conventional usage, and yoga when it is derived from another word\u2019s meaning by regular etymological rules. For example, the word go (\u201ccow\u201d) is an example of r\u016b\u1e0dhi, since its relation with its literal meaning is purely conventional. The denotation of the word p\u0101caka (\u201cchef\u201d), on the other hand, is a yoga-v\u1e5btti, through the word\u2019s derivation from the root pac (\u201cto cook\u201d) by addition of the agent suffix ka. Beside its mukhya-v\u1e5btti, or primary meaning, a word can also be used in a secondary, metaphorical sense. This usage is called lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101. The rule is that a word should not be understood metaphorically if its mukhya-v\u1e5btti makes sense in the given context; only after the mukhya-v\u1e5btti fails to convey a word\u2019s meaning may lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101-v\u1e5btti be justifiably presumed. The function of lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 is technically explained in the k\u0101vya-\u015b\u0101stras as an extended reference, pointing to something in some way related to the object of the literal meaning. Thus, the phrase ga\u1e45g\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 gho\u1e63a\u1e25 literally means \u201cthe cowherd village in the Ganges.\u201d But that idea is absurd, so here ga\u1e45g\u0101y\u0101m should rather be understood by its lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 to mean \u201con the bank of the Ganges,\u201d the bank being something related to the river. Gau\u1e47a-v\u1e5btti is a special kind of lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, where the meaning is extended to some idea of similarity. For example, in the statement si\u1e41ho devadatta\u1e25 (\u201cDevadatta is a lion\u201d), heroic Devadatta is metaphorically called a lion because of his lionlike qualities. In contrast, the example of the general kind of lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, namely ga\u1e45g\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 gho\u1e63a\u1e25, involves a relationship not of similarity but of location. In this first verse of the Eighty-seventh Chapter, Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja expresses doubt as to how the words of the Vedas can refer to the Absolute Truth by any of the valid kinds of \u015babda-v\u1e5btti. He asks, katha\u1e41 s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t caranti: How can the Vedas directly describe Brahman by r\u016b\u1e0dha-mukhya-v\u1e5btti, literal meaning based on convention? After all, the Absolute is anirde\u015bya, inaccessible to designation. And how can the Vedas even describe Brahman by gau\u1e47a-v\u1e5btti, metaphor based on similar qualities? The Vedas are gu\u1e47a-v\u1e5bttaya\u1e25, full of qualitative descriptions, but Brahman is nirgu\u1e47a, without qualities. Obviously, a metaphor based on similar qualities cannot apply in the case of something that has no qualities. Furthermore, Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja points out that Brahman is sad-asata\u1e25 param, beyond all causes and effects. Having no connection with any manifest existence, subtle or gross, the Absolute cannot be expressed by either yoga-v\u1e5btti, a meaning derived etymologically, or lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, metaphor, since both require some relationship of Brahman to other entities. Thus King Par\u012bk\u1e63it is puzzled as to how the words of the Vedas can directly describe the Absolute Truth."

        "translation": "\u015aukadeva Gosvam\u012b said: The Supreme Lord manifested the material intelligence, senses, mind and vital air of the living entities so that they could indulge their desires for sense gratification, take repeated births to engage in fruitive activities, become elevated in future lives and ultimately attain liberation.",
        "purport": " At the dawn of creation, when the conditioned living entities lay dormant within the transcendental body of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, He initiated the process of creation by sending forth the coverings of intelligence, mind and so on for the living entities\u2019 benefit. As stated here, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the independent Lord (prabhu), and the living entities are His jana, dependents. Thus we should understand that the Lord creates the cosmos entirely for the living entities\u2019 sake; compassion is His sole motive. By providing the living entities with gross and subtle bodies, the Supreme Lord enables them to pursue sense gratification and, in the human form, religiosity, economic development and liberation. In each body the conditioned soul utilizes his senses for enjoyment, and when he comes to the human form he must also discharge various duties assigned to him at the different stages of his life. If he faithfully discharges his duties, he earns more refined and extensive enjoyment in the future; if not, he is degraded. And when the soul eventually hankers to be freed from material life, the path of liberation is always available. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b comments that in this verse the repeated use of the word ca (\u201cand\u201d) indicates the importance of all of what the Lord provides \u2014 not only the path of liberation, but also the paths of gradual elevation through religious life and appropriate sense enjoyment. In all their endeavors the living entities depend on the Lord\u2019s mercy for success. Without intelligence, senses, mind and vital air, the living entities cannot achieve anything \u2014 neither elevation to heaven, purification through knowledge, perfection of the eightfold meditational yoga, nor pure devotion through following the process of bhakti-yoga, beginning with hearing and chanting the names of God. How, then, if the Supreme arranges all these facilities for the conditioned souls\u2019 welfare, can He be impersonal? Far from presenting the Absolute Truth as ultimately impersonal, the Upani\u1e63ads speak at great length about His personal qualities. The Absolute described by the Upani\u1e63ads is free from all inferior, material qualities, and yet He is omniscient, omnipotent, the master and controller of all, the universally worshipable Lord, He who awards the results of everyone\u2019s work, and the reservoir of all eternity, knowledge and bliss. The Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (1.1.9) states, ya\u1e25 sarva-j\u00f1a\u1e25 sa sarva-vid yasya j\u00f1\u0101na-maya\u1e41 tapa\u1e25: \u201cHe who is all-knowing, from whom the potency of all knowledge comes \u2014 He is the wisest of all.\u201d In the words of the B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (4.4.22, 3.7.3, and 1.2.4), sarvasya v\u0101\u015b\u012b sarvasye\u015b\u0101na\u1e25: \u201cHe is the Lord and controller of everyone\u201d; ya\u1e25 p\u1e5bthivy\u0101\u1e41 ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan p\u1e5bthivy\u0101 \u0101ntara\u1e25: \u201cHe who resides within the earth and pervades it\u201d; and so\u00a0\u2019k\u0101mayata bahu sy\u0101m: \u201cHe desired, \u2018I will become many.\u2019\u201d Similarly, the Aitareya Upani\u1e63ad (3.11) states, sa aik\u1e63ata tat tejo\u00a0\u2019s\u1e5bjata: \u201cHe glanced at His potency, who then manifested the creation,\u201d while the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.1.1) declares, satya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam ananta\u1e41 brahma: \u201cThe Supreme is unlimited truth and knowledge.\u201d The phrase tat tvam asi, \u201cYou are that\u201d (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 6.8.7), is often cited by impersonalists as a confirmation of the absolute identity of the finite j\u012bva soul with his creator. \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya and his followers elevate these words to the status of one of the few mah\u0101-v\u0101kyas, key phrases they say express the essential purport of Ved\u0101nta. The leading thinkers of the standard Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava schools of Ved\u0101nta, however, vociferously disagree with this interpretation. \u0100c\u0101ryas R\u0101m\u0101nuja, Madhva, Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a and others have offered numerous alternative explanations according to a systematic study of the Upani\u1e63ads and other \u015brutis. The question Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it has submitted here \u2014 namely, \u201cHow can the Vedas directly refer to the Absolute Truth?\u201d \u2014 has been answered as follows by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b: \u201cThe Lord created intelligence and other elements for the sake of the conditioned living beings.\u201d A skeptic may object that this answer is irrelevant. But \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s answer is not actually irrelevant, as \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b explains. Answers to subtle questions must often be phrased indirectly. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself states in His instructions to Uddhava (Bh\u0101g. 11.21.35), parok\u1e63a-v\u0101d\u0101 \u1e5b\u1e63aya\u1e25 parok\u1e63a\u1e41 mama ca priyam: \u201cThe Vedic seers and mantras deal in esoteric terms, and I also am pleased by such confidential descriptions.\u201d In the present context, the impersonalists, on whose behalf Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja asked his question, cannot appreciate the direct answer, so instead \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva gives an indirect reply: \u201cYou say that Brahman is indescribable by words. But if the Supreme Lord had not created the intelligence, mind and senses, then sound and the other objects of perception would all be just as indescribable as your Brahman. You would have been blind and deaf since birth, and would know nothing about physical forms and sounds, what to speak of the Absolute. So, just as the merciful Lord has given us all faculties of perception for experiencing and describing to others the sensations of sight, sound and so forth, in the same way He may give someone the receptive capacity to realize Brahman. He may, if He chooses, create some extraordinary way for words to function \u2014 apart from their ordinary references to material substances, qualities, categories and actions \u2014 that will enable them to express the Supreme Truth. He is, after all, the almighty Lord (prabhu), and He can easily make the indescribable describable.\u201d Lord Matsya assures King Satyavrata that the Absolute Truth can be known from the words of the Vedas: \u201cYou will be thoroughly advised and favored by Me, and because of your inquiries, everything about My glories, which are known as para\u1e41 brahma, will be manifest within your heart. Thus you will know everything about Me.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 8.24.38) The fortunate soul who has been graced by the Supreme Lord with divine inquisitiveness will ask questions about the nature of the Absolute, and by hearing the answers given by great sages, which are recorded in the Vedic literatures, he will come to understand the Lord as He is. Thus only by the special mercy of the Supreme Person does Brahman become \u015babditam, \u201cliterally denoted by words.\u201d Otherwise, without the Lord\u2019s exceptional grace, the words of the Vedas cannot reveal the Absolute Truth. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b suggests that the word buddhi in this verse spoken by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b can indicate the mahat-tattva, from which evolve the various expansions of ether (such as sound), which are designated here as indriya. M\u0101tr\u0101rtham, then, means \u201cfor the sake of using transcendental sound to describe Brahman,\u201d since for that precise purpose the Supreme Lord inspired prak\u1e5bti to evolve ether and sound. A further understanding of the purpose of creation is spoken by the words bhav\u0101rtham and \u0101tmane kalpan\u0101ya (if the reading kalpan\u0101ya instead of akalpan\u0101ya is taken). Bhav\u0101rtham means \u201cfor the good of the living entities.\u201d Worship (kalpanam) of the Supreme Self (\u0101tmane) is the means by which the living entities can fulfill the divine purpose for which they exist. Intelligence, mind and senses are meant to be used for worshiping the Supreme Lord, whether or not the living entity has yet brought them to the stage of transcendental purification. How both purified and unpurified devotees use their intelligence, mind and senses in worshiping the Lord is described in reference to the following quote from the Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad (P\u016brva 12): \u201cThe Supreme Lord, appearing in His two-armed form, had divine lotus eyes, a complexion the color of a cloud, and garments that resembled lightning. He wore a garland of forest flowers, and His beauty was enhanced by His pose of meditative silence.\u201d The transcendental intelligence and senses of the Lord\u2019s perfect devotees correctly perceive His purely spiritual beauty, and their realizations are echoed in the Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b-\u015bruti\u2019s comparison of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s eyes, body and clothing to a lotus, a cloud and lightning. On the other hand, devotees on the level of s\u0101dhana, who are in the process of becoming purified, have only barely realized the Supreme Lord\u2019s boundless spiritual beauty. Nonetheless, by hearing scriptural passages such as this one from the Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad, they engage in contemplating Him to the best of their fledgling ability. Although the neophyte devotees have not yet learned how to fully realize the Lord or meditate steadily on even the effulgence surrounding His body, still they take pleasure in presuming, \u201cWe are meditating on our Lord.\u201d And the Supreme Lord, moved by the waves of His boundless mercy, Himself thinks, \u201cThese devotees are meditating on Me.\u201d When their devotion matures, He draws them to His feet to engage in His intimate service. Thus it is concluded that the Vedas have access to the personal identity of the Supreme only by His mercy."

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the twenty-eight verses of the prayers of the personified Vedas (texts 14-41) represent the opinions of each of the twenty-eight major \u015brutis. These chief Upani\u1e63ads and other \u015brutis concern themselves with various approaches to the Absolute Truth, and among them those \u015brutis are supreme which emphasize pure, unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Upani\u1e63ads direct our attention to the Personality of Godhead by first negating what is distinct from Him and then defining some of His important characteristics. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b interprets the first words of this prayer, jaya jaya, to mean \u201cplease reveal Your superexcellence.\u201d The word jaya is repeated out of either reverence or joy. \u201cHow should I reveal My excellence?\u201d the Lord might ask. The \u015brutis answer by requesting Him to mercifully destroy the ignorance of all living beings and attract them to His lotus feet. The Lord says, \u201cBut M\u0101y\u0101, who imposes ignorance on the j\u012bvas, is full of good qualities [g\u1e5bbh\u012bta-gu\u1e47\u0101m]. Why should I oppose her?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d the Vedas answer, \u201cbut she has taken on the three modes of nature to bewilder the conditioned souls and make them falsely identify with their material bodies. Her modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, moreover, are tainted [do\u1e63a-g\u1e5bbh\u012bta] because You are not manifest in their presence.\u201d The \u015brutis go on to address the Lord as ajita, implying that \u201conly You cannot be conquered by M\u0101y\u0101, whereas others, like Brahm\u0101, are defeated by their own faults.\u201d The Lord responds, \u201cBut what proof do you have that she cannot conquer Me?\u201d \u201cThe proof lies in the fact that in Your original state You have already realized the perfection of all opulences.\u201d At this point the Lord might object that merely destroying the ignorance of the j\u012bvas will not suffice to bring them to His lotus feet, since the j\u012bva soul, even after his ignorance is dispelled, cannot attain the Lord without engaging in devotional service. As the Lord states in His own words, bhakty\u0101ham ekay\u0101 gr\u0101hya\u1e25: \u201cI am attainable only through devotional service.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.14.21) To this objection the \u015brutis reply, \u201cMy Lord, O You who awaken all energies, after creating the intelligence and senses of the living entities, You inspire them to work hard and enjoy the fruits of their labor. In addition, by Your mercy You awaken their ability to pursue the progressive paths of knowledge, mystic yoga and devotional service, allowing them to advance toward You in Your aspects of Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n, respectively. And when j\u00f1\u0101na, yoga and bhakti mature, You empower the living beings to directly realize You in each of Your three aspects.\u201d If the Lord were to ask for authoritative evidence to support this statement by the personified Vedas, they humbly reply, \u201cWe ourselves are the evidence. On some occasions \u2014 such as now, the time of creation \u2014 You consort with Your external, M\u0101y\u0101 potency, whereas You are always present with Your internal energy. It is at times such as the present, when Your activity is outwardly manifest, that we, the Vedas, can recognize You in Your play.\u201d Thus endowed with authority by their personal association with the Supreme Lord, the \u015brutis promulgate the processes of karma, j\u00f1\u0101na, yoga and bhakti as various means for the conditioned souls to employ their intelligence, senses, mind and vitality in search of the Absolute Truth. In many places the Vedas glorify the transcendental, personal qualities of the Supreme. The following verse appears in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (6.11), the Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad (Uttara 97), and the Brahma Upani\u1e63ad (4.1): \u201cThe one Supreme Lord lives hidden inside all created things. He pervades all matter and sits within the hearts of all living beings. As the indwelling Supersoul, He supervises their material activities. Thus, while having no material qualities Himself, He is the unique witness and giver of consciousness.\u201d The Supreme\u2019s personal qualities are further described in the following quotations from the Upani\u1e63ads: Ya\u1e25 sarva-j\u00f1a\u1e25 sa sarva-vid yasya j\u00f1\u0101na-maya\u1e41 tapa\u1e25. \u201cHe who is all-knowing, from whom the potency of all knowledge comes \u2014 He is the wisest of all\u201d (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.1.9); sarvasya va\u015b\u012b sarvasye\u015b\u0101na\u1e25: \u201cHe is the Lord and controller of everyone\u201d (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 4.4.22); and ya\u1e25 p\u1e5bthivy\u0101\u1e41 ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan p\u1e5bthivy\u0101 \u0101ntaro ya\u1e41 p\u1e5bthiv\u012b na veda: \u201cHe who resides within the earth and pervades it, whom the earth does not know.\u201d (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 3.7.3) The Lord\u2019s role in creation is mentioned in many statements of the \u015bruti. The B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (1.2.4) states, so\u00a0\u2019k\u0101mayata bahu sy\u0101m: \u201cHe desired, \u2018I will become many.\u2019\u201d The phrase so\u00a0\u2019k\u0101mayata (\u201cHe desired\u201d) here implies that the Lord\u2019s personality is eternal, for even prior to the creation the Absolute Truth experienced desire, and desire is an attribute unique to persons. The Aitareya Upani\u1e63ad (3.11) similarly states, sa aik\u1e63ata tat-tejo\u00a0\u2019s\u1e5bjata: \u201cHe saw, and His power sent forth the creation.\u201d Here the word tat-teja\u1e25 refers to the Lord\u2019s partial expansion Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who glances upon M\u0101y\u0101 and thus manifests the material creation. Or tat-teja\u1e25 may refer to the Lord\u2019s impersonal Brahman feature, His potency of all-pervasive, eternal existence. As described in \u015ar\u012b Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.40): \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes.\u201d In summing up this verse, \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cAll glories, all glories to You, O unconquerable one! Please defeat the influence of Your eternal M\u0101y\u0101, who covers all moving and nonmoving creatures and who rules over the modes of illusion. Without Your influence, all these Vedic mantras would be powerless to sing of You as the ocean of transcendental qualities.\u201d"

        "translation": "This perceivable world is identified with the Supreme because the Supreme Brahman is the ultimate foundation of all existence, remaining unchanged as all created things are generated from it and at last dissolved into it, just as clay remains unchanged by the products made from it and again merged with it. Thus it is toward You alone that the Vedic sages direct all their thoughts, words and acts. After all, how can the footsteps of men fail to touch the earth on which they live?",
        "purport": " There may be some doubt as to whether the Vedic mantras are unanimous when identifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After all, some mantras state, indro y\u0101to\u00a0\u2019vasitasya r\u0101j\u0101: \u201cIndra is the King of all moving and nonmoving beings\u201d (\u1e5ag Veda 1.32.15), while others say, agnir m\u016brdh\u0101 diva\u1e25: \u201cAgni is the chief of the heavens,\u201d and yet other mantras point to different deities as the Absolute. It would seem, then, that the Vedas present a polytheistic world view. Answering this doubt, the Vedas themselves explain in this verse that there can be only one source of universal creation, called Brahman or B\u1e5bhat, \u201cthe greatest,\u201d which is the singular truth underlying and pervading all existence. No finite deity like Indra or Agni can fulfill this unique role, nor would the \u015brutis be so ignorant as to propose such an idea. As indicated here by the word tvayi, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u alone is the Absolute Truth. Indra and other demigods may be glorified in various ways, but they possess only those powers Lord \u015ar\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has granted them. The Vedic sages understand that this entire world \u2014 including Indra, Agni, and everything else perceivable by the eyes, ears and other senses \u2014 is identical with the one Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead, who is called B\u1e5bhat, \u201cthe greatest,\u201d because He is ava\u015be\u1e63a, \u201cthe ultimate substance that remains.\u201d From the Lord everything expands at creation, and into Him everything dissolves at annihilation. He exists before and after the material manifestation as the constant basis, known to philosophers as the \u201cingredient cause,\u201d up\u0101d\u0101na. Despite the fact that countless manifestations emanate from Him, the Supreme Lord exists eternally unchanged \u2014 an idea the \u015brutis specifically emphasize here with the word avik\u1e5bt\u0101t. The words m\u1e5bdi v\u0101 (\u201cas in the case of clay\u201d) allude to a famous analogy spoken by Ud\u0101laka to his son \u015avetaketu in the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad (6.4.1): v\u0101c\u0101rambhana\u1e41 vik\u0101ro n\u0101madheya\u1e41 m\u1e5bttikety eva satyam. \u201cThe objects of the material world exist merely as names, transformations defined by language, whereas the ingredient cause, like the clay from which pots are made, is the actual reality.\u201d A mass of clay is the ingredient cause of various pots, statues and so on, but the clay itself remains in its essence unchanged. Eventually, the pots and other objects will be destroyed and return to the clay from which they came. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the total ingredient cause, yet He remains eternally untouched by transformation. This is the purport of the statement sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma: \u201cEverything is Brahman.\u201d (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 3.14.1) Wondering at this mystery, the great devotee Gajendra prayed, \u201cObeisances again and again to You, the source of all creation. You are the inconceivable cause of all causes, and of You there is no other cause.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 8.3.15) Prak\u1e5bti, material nature, is often considered the ingredient cause of creation, in Western science as well as in the Vedas. This does not contradict the higher fact of the Supreme Lord\u2019s being the final cause, since prak\u1e5bti is His energy, and is herself subject to change. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.24.19), Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cThe material universe is real, having prak\u1e5bti as its original ingredient and final state. Lord Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the resting place of nature, which becomes manifest by the power of time. Thus nature, the almighty Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and time are not different from Me, the Supreme Absolute Truth.\u201d Prak\u1e5bti, however, undergoes transformation, while her Lord, the supreme puru\u1e63a, does not. Prak\u1e5bti is the Personality of Godhead\u2019s external energy, but He has another energy \u2014 His internal energy \u2014 which is svar\u016bpa-bh\u016bt\u0101, nondifferent from His very essence. The Lord\u2019s internal energy, like Himself, is never subject to material change. Therefore the mantras of the Vedas, along with the \u1e5b\u1e63is who have received these mantras in meditation and transmitted them for the benefit of mankind, direct their attention primarily toward the Personality of Godhead. The Vedic sages direct the activities of their mind and words \u2014 that is to say, the inner as well as the literal meaning (abhidh\u0101-v\u1e5btti) of their utterances \u2014 first of all toward Him, and only secondarily toward separated transformations of prak\u1e5bti, such as Indra and other demigods. Just as a man\u2019s footsteps, whether placed on mud, stone or bricks, cannot fail to touch the surface of the earth, so whatever the Vedas discuss within the realm of material generation, they relate to the Absolute Truth. Mundane literature describes limited phenomena, disregarding the relation of its subjects to the total reality, but the Vedas always focus their perfect vision on the Supreme. As the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad affirms in its statements m\u1e5bttikety eva satyam and sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma, reality is understood properly when everything is seen to be dependent on Brahman, the Absolute, for its existence. Brahman alone is real, not because nothing we see in this world is real, but because Brahman is the absolute, final cause of everything. Thus the word satyam, as used in the phrase m\u1e5bttikety eva satyam, has been defined in another context as \u201cingredient cause\u201d by no less an authority than Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself: \u201cA material object, itself composed of an essential ingredient, creates another material object through transformation. In this way one created object becomes the cause and basis of another created object. A particular thing may be called real in that it possesses the basic nature of another object that constitutes its cause and original state.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.24.18) Explaining the word Brahman, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da writes in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead: \u201cThe word Brahman indicates the greatest of all and the maintainer of everything. The impersonalists are attracted by the greatness of the sky, but because of their poor fund of knowledge they are not attracted by the greatness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In our practical life, however, we are attracted by the greatness of a person and not by the greatness of a big mountain. Actually the term Brahman actually applies to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only; therefore in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Arjuna admitted that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Parabrahman, or the supreme rest of everything. \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Brahman because of His unlimited knowledge unlimited potencies, unlimited strength, unlimited influence, unlimited beauty and unlimited renunciation. Therefore the word Brahman can be applied to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only. Arjuna affirms that because the impersonal Brahman is the effulgence emanating as rays of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental body, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Parabrahman. Everything is resting on Brahman, but Brahman itself is resting on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate Brahman, or Parabrahman. The material elements are accepted as inferior energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because by their interaction the cosmic manifestation takes place, rests on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and after dissolution again enters into the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as His subtle energy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the cause of both manifestation and dissolution.\u201d In summary, \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cThe demigods, headed by \u015aiva, Agni, S\u016brya and Indra, and indeed all beings in the universe, do not come into existence independently of You. The mantras of the Vedas, though they speak from various viewpoints, all speak about You, the unborn Lord appearing in numerous forms.\u201d"

Then what to speak of those who, having by spiritual strength rid their minds of bad habits and freed themselves from time, are able to worship Your true nature, O supreme one, finding within it uninterrupted bliss?",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, in the previous verse those \u015brutis whose presentation of the Supreme Truth may seem impersonal clarified their true purpose. Now, in the present verse, those who focus exclusively on the divine Personality of Godhead, who speak of His transcendental pastimes, take their turn in praising Him. Because all the Vedas declare the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead as the cause of all causes, discriminating persons should take to His worship. By diving into the ocean of His glories, intelligent devotees help dispel the distress of all souls and loosen their own burning attachment to materialistic life. These advancing devotees gradually give up all material attachment and lose any interest they once had in the troublesome austerities of karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga. Beyond these devotees are the s\u016bris, connoisseurs of spiritual truth, who honor the nectarean ocean of the Supreme Lord\u2019s glories by immersing themselves fully within it. These mature devotees of the Supreme Lord achieve unimaginable perfection. The Lord, reciprocating their sincere endeavors, empowers them to realize Him in His personal form. Remembering with rapture the Lord\u2019s intimate pastimes and entourage, they are automatically freed from the last subtle traces of mental contamination and from sensitivity to the unavoidable pains of disease and old age.

        "purport": " Life is without purpose for one who remains ignorant of his most well-wishing benefactor and thus fails to worship Him. Such a person\u2019s breathing is no better than the breathing of a blacksmith\u2019s bellows. The gift of human life is a fortunate opportunity for the conditioned soul, but by turning away from his Lord, the living being commits spiritual suicide. In the words of \u015ar\u012b \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad (3): \u201cThe killer of the soul, whoever he may be, must enter into the planets known as the worlds of the faithless, full of darkness and ignorance.\u201d Asury\u0101\u1e25 means \u201cto be obtained by demons,\u201d and demons are persons who have no devotion for the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This definition is stated in the Agni Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cThere are two kinds of created beings in this world, godly and demoniac. Those dedicated to the devotional service of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are godly, and those opposed to such service are demoniac.\u201d Similarly, the B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (4.4.15) states, na ced aved\u012bn mahat\u012b vina\u1e63\u1e6di\u1e25 \u2026 ye tad vidur am\u1e5bt\u0101s te bhavanty athetare du\u1e25kham evopayanti: \u201cIf one does not come to know the Supreme, he must suffer utter destruction.\u2026 Those who realize the Supreme become immortal, but others inevitably suffer.\u201d A person must revive his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to be relieved of the suffering caused by ignorance, but the process by which this is done need not be difficult, as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a assures us in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.34): \u201cEngage your mind in always thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.\u201d Despite disqualifications and weaknesses, one need only willingly become anuvidha, the Supreme Lord\u2019s trusting and trustworthy servant. The Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (2.2.13) proclaims: \u201cAmong all the eternal, conscious beings, there is one who supplies the needs of everyone else. The wise souls who worship Him in His abode attain everlasting peace. Others cannot.\u201d What is alive, and what is dead? The bodies and minds of materialistic nondevotees seem to display the symptoms of life, but this appearance is deceptive. Actually, the conditioned soul has little control over his own bodily existence. Against his will, he has to excrete waste, get sick from time to time, and eventually age and die. And in his mind he unwillingly suffers anger, hankering and lamentation. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a describes this situation as yantr\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101ni m\u0101yay\u0101 (Bg. 18.61), riding helplessly as a passenger in a mechanical vehicle. The soul undoubtedly is alive, and irrevocably so, but in his ignorance that inner life is covered and forgotten. In its place, the automation of the external mind and body carries out the dictates of the modes of nature, which force one to act in a way altogether irrelevant to the dormant needs of the soul. Calling out to the forgetful prisoners of illusion, the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (2.5) urges: \u201cAll you sons of immortality, hear, you who once resided in the divine kingdom!\u201d So, on the one hand, what is normally viewed as living \u2014 the material body \u2014 is in actuality a dead machine being manipulated by the modes of nature. And on the other hand, what the materialist condescendingly views as inert matter meant for exploitation is in its unknown essence connected with a living intelligence vastly more potent than his own. The Vedic civilization recognizes the intelligence behind nature as belonging to demigods who preside over the various elements, and ultimately to the Supreme Lord Himself. Matter, after all, cannot act coherently without the impulse and guidance of a living force. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10): \u201cThis material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My direction, O son of Kunt\u012b, producing all moving and nonmoving beings. Under its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.\u201d In the beginning of creation, Lord Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u glanced at the dormant material nature, prak\u1e5bti. Thus awakened, the subtle prak\u1e5bti began to evolve into more concrete forms: first the mahat; then false ego in conjunction with each of prak\u1e5bti\u2019s three modes; and gradually the various material elements, including intelligence, mind, the senses and the five physical elements with their presiding demigods. Even after becoming separately manifested, however, the deities responsible for the various elements could not work together to produce the perceptible world until Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, by His special mercy, once more intervened. This is described in the Third Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.5.38-39): \u201cThe controlling deities of these physical elements are empowered expansions of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. They are embodied by eternal time under the external energy, and they are His parts and parcels. Because they were entrusted with different functions of universal duties and were unable to perform them, they offered fascinating prayers to the Lord. The demigods said, \u2018O Lord, Your lotus feet are like an umbrella for the surrendered souls, protecting them from all the miseries of material existence. All the sages under that shelter throw off all material miseries. We therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto Your lotus feet.\u2019\u201d Hearing the prayers of the assembled demigods of the elements, the Supreme Lord then showed His favor (Bh\u0101g. 3.6.1-3): \u201cThe Lord thus heard about the suspension of the progressive creative functions of the universe due to the noncombination of His potencies, such as the mahat-tattva. The Supreme Powerful Lord then simultaneously entered into the twenty-three elements with the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, His external energy, who alone amalgamates all the different elements. Thus when the Personality of Godhead entered into the elements by His energy, all the living entities were enlivened into different activities, just as one is engaged in his work after awakening from sleep.\u201d In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da explains the five levels of ego covering the self: \u201cWithin the body there are five different departments of existence, known as anna-maya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya, mano-maya, vij\u00f1\u0101na-maya, and at last \u0101nanda-maya. [These are enumerated in the Brahm\u0101nanda-vall\u012b of the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad.] In the beginning of life, every living entity is food conscious. A child or an animal is satisfied only by getting nice food. This stage of consciousness, in which the goal is to eat sumptuously, is called anna-maya. Anna means \u2018food.\u2019 After this one lives in the consciousness of being alive. If one can continue his life without being attacked or destroyed, one thinks himself happy. This stage is called pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya, or consciousness of one\u2019s existence. After this stage, when one is situated on the mental platform, that consciousness is called mano-maya. The material civilization is primarily situated in these three stages \u2014 annamaya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya and mano-maya. The first concern of civilized persons is economic development, the next concern is defense against being annihilated, and the next consciousness is mental speculation, the philosophical approach to the values of life. \u201cIf by the evolutionary process of philosophical life one happens to reach the platform of intellectual life and understands that he is not this material body but is a spirit soul, he is situated in the vij\u00f1\u0101na-maya stage. Then, by evolution of spiritual life, he comes to understand the Supreme Lord, or the Supreme Soul. When one develops his relationship with Him and executes devotional service, that stage of life is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the \u0101nanda-maya stage. \u0100nanda-maya is the blissful life of knowledge and eternity. As it is said in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, \u0101nanda-mayo\u00a0\u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t. The Supreme Brahman and the subordinate Brahman, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities, are both joyful by nature. As long as the living entities are situated in the lower four stages of life \u2014 anna-maya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya, mano-maya and vij\u00f1\u0101na-maya \u2014 they are considered to be in the material condition of life, but as soon as one reaches the stage of \u0101nanda-maya, he becomes a liberated soul. This \u0101nanda-maya stage is explained in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as the brahma-bh\u016bta stage. There it is said that in the brahma-bh\u016bta stage of life there is no anxiety and no hankering. This stage begins when one becomes equally disposed toward all living entities, and it then expands to the stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in which one hankers to render service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This hankering for advancement in devotional service is not the same as hankering for sense gratification in material existence. In other words, hankering remains in spiritual life, but it becomes purified. When our senses are purified, they become freed from all material stages, namely anna-maya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya, mano-maya and vij\u00f1\u0101na-maya, and they become situated in the highest stage \u2014 \u0101nanda-maya, or blissful life in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. \u201cThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers consider \u0101nanda-maya to be the state of being merged in the Supreme. To them, \u0101nanda-maya means that the Supersoul and the individual soul become one. But the real fact is that oneness does not mean merging into the Supreme and losing one\u2019s own individual existence. Merging into the spiritual existence is the living entity\u2019s realization of qualitative oneness with the Supreme Lord in His aspects of eternity and knowledge. But the actual \u0101nanda-maya (blissful) stage is attained when one is engaged in devotional service. That is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: mad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m. The brahma-bh\u016bta \u0101nanda-maya stage is complete only when there is the exchange of love between the Supreme and the subordinate living entities. Unless one comes to this \u0101nanda-maya stage of life, his breathing is like the breathing of a bellows in a blacksmith\u2019s shop, his duration of life is like that of a tree, and he is no better than the lower animals like the camels, hogs and dogs.\u201d In accompanying the j\u012bva within the coverings of M\u0101y\u0101, the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is not bound by karmic entanglement as the j\u012bva is. Rather, the Supreme Soul\u2019s connection with these coverings is like the apparent connection between the moon and some tree branches it is seen through. The Supersoul is sad-asata\u1e25 param, always transcendental to the subtle and gross manifestations of anna-maya and so on, although He enters among them as the sanctioning witness of all activities. As their final cause, the Supersoul is in one sense identical with the manifest products of creation, but in His original identity (svar\u016bpa) He remains distinct. In this second sense He is the \u0101nanda-maya alone, the last of the five ko\u015bas. Therefore the \u015brutis address Him here as ava\u015be\u1e63am, the residual essence. This is also expressed in the text of the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.7): raso vai sa\u1e25. Within His personal essence, the Supreme Lord enjoys rasa, the reciprocation of the mellows of devotional service, and integral to the play of rasas is the participation of realized j\u012bvas. Raso vai sa\u1e25 rasam hy ev\u0101ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101nand\u012b bhavati: \u201cHe is the embodiment of rasa, and the j\u012bva who realizes this rasa becomes fully ecstatic.\u201d Or in the words of the personified Vedas praying in this verse, the Supersoul is \u1e5btam, which \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b interprets as here meaning \u201crealized by great sages.\u201d In the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, the last word of all authoritative scripture (sarv\u0101ntima-\u015bruti) is contained in the aphorism raso vai sa\u1e25, which is demonstrably a reference to Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the infinitely expanding embodiment of divine pleasure (sarva-b\u1e5bhattam\u0101nanda). The Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b \u015bruti (Uttara 96) states, yo\u00a0\u2019sau j\u0101grat-svapna-su\u1e63uptim at\u012btya tury\u0101t\u012bto gop\u0101la\u1e25: \u201cLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the cowherd, transcends not only the material consciousness of wakefulness, dream and deep sleep, but also the fourth realm of pure, spiritual awareness.\u201d The \u0101nanda-maya Supersoul is simply an aspect of the primeval Lord Govinda, as declared by Him, vi\u1e63\u1e6dabhy\u0101ham ida\u1e41 k\u1e5btsnam ek\u0101\u1e41\u015bena sthito jagat: \u201cWith a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.\u201d (Bg. 10.42) The \u015brutis thus tactfully assert that even among the various personal forms of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is supreme. Understanding this, N\u0101rada Muni will later offer obeisances to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the words namas tasmai bhagavate k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101y\u0101mala-k\u012brtaye (text 46), even though He is standing in front of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u1e5a\u1e63i. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b concludes his comments on this verse by praying, \u201cO Lord Narahari, persons who have attained this human form live uselessly, merely breathing like bellows, if they fail to worship You by hearing about You, chanting Your glories, remembering You and performing the other devotional practices.\u201d"

        "translation": "Among the followers of the methods set forth by great sages, those with less refined vision worship the Supreme as present in the region of the abdomen, while the \u0100ru\u1e47is worship Him as present in the heart, in the subtle center from which all the pr\u0101\u1e47ic channels emanate.

        "purport": " Here the \u015brutis who teach meditational yoga glorify the Personality of Godhead. The various processes of yoga are for the most part gradual and full of opportunities for distraction. Authentic methods of yoga, nonetheless, all aim at meditation on the Supersoul (Param\u0101tm\u0101), whose primary residence is in the region of the heart, alongside the j\u012bva soul. This manifestation of Param\u0101tm\u0101 in the heart is very subtle and difficult to perceive (daharam), and thus only advanced yog\u012bs can realize Him there. Neophyte meditators often practice focusing on the Supersoul\u2019s secondary presence in one of the lower centers of vital energy, such as the m\u016bl\u0101dh\u0101ra-cakra, at the base of the spine, the sv\u0101dhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na-cakra, in the area of the navel, or the ma\u1e47ip\u016bra-cakra, in the abdomen. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a refers to His expansion as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in the abdominal cakra as follows: \u201cI am the fire of digestion in the bodies of all living entities, and I join with the air of life, outgoing and incoming, to digest the four kinds of food.\u201d (Bg. 15.14) Lord Vai\u015bv\u0101nara presides over digestion and in general bestows the capacity of mobility on animals, humans and demigods. In the judgment of the \u015brutis speaking this verse, those who limit their meditation to this form of the Lord are less intelligent, k\u016brpa-d\u1e5b\u015ba\u1e25, meaning literally \u201chaving eyes clouded by dust.\u201d The superior yog\u012bs known as \u0100ru\u1e47is, on the other hand, worship the Supersoul in His form as the indwelling companion of the j\u012bva in the heart, the Lord who endows His dependent with the power of knowledge and inspires him with all varieties of practical intelligence. And just as the physical heart is the center of blood circulation, so the subtle heartcakra is the crossroads of numerous channels of pr\u0101\u1e47a, called n\u0101\u1e0d\u012bs, which extend outward to all parts of the body. When these passageways have been sufficiently purified, the \u0100ru\u1e47i yog\u012bs can leave the heart region and go upward to the cakra at the roof of the brain. Yog\u012bs who leave their bodies through this cakra, the brahma-randhra, go directly to the kingdom of God, from which they need never return to be reborn. Thus even the unsure process of meditational yoga can bear the fruit of pure devotion if it is followed perfectly. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura cites several \u015bruti-mantras that echo the words of this verse: udara\u1e41 brahmeti \u015b\u0101rkar\u0101k\u1e63\u0101 up\u0101sate h\u1e5bdaya\u1e41 brahmeti \u0101ru\u1e47ayo brahm\u0101 haivait\u0101 ita \u016brdhva\u1e41 tv evodasarpat tac-chiro\u00a0\u2019\u015brayate. \u201cThose whose vision is clouded identify Brahman with the abdomen, while the \u0100ru\u1e47is worship Brahman in the heart. One who is truly Brahman-realized travels upward from the heart to take shelter of the Lord who is manifested at the top of the head.\u201d \u201cThere are one hundred and one subtle pr\u0101\u1e47ic channels emanating from the heart. One of these \u2014 the su\u1e63um\u1e47\u0101 \u2014 extends to the top of the head. By passing up through this channel, one transcends death. The other channels lead in all directions, to various kinds of rebirth.\u201d (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 8.6.6) The Upani\u1e63ads refer repeatedly to the indwelling Param\u0101tm\u0101. \u015ar\u012b \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.12-13) describes Him as follows: \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes the Puru\u1e63a to initiate the expansion of this cosmos. He is the perfectly pure goal that yog\u012bs strive to reach, the effulgent and infallible ultimate controller. Measuring the size of a thumb, the Puru\u1e63a is always present as the Supersoul within the hearts of all living beings. By exercising proper intelligence, one can realize Him within the heart; those who learn this method will gain immortality.\u201d In conclusion, \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cLet us worship the Supreme Lord, who resides in the heart. When mortal beings think of Him by the standard procedures established by great sages, meditating upon Him in His expansions in the abdomen and other regions of the body, the Lord reciprocates by destroying all fear of death.\u201d"

        "translation": "Apparently entering among the variegated species of living beings You have created, You inspire them to act, manifesting Yourself according to their higher and lower positions, just as fire manifests differently according to the shape of what it burns. Therefore those of spotless intelligence, who are altogether free from material attachments, realize Your undifferentiated, unchanging Self to be the permanent reality among all these impermanent life forms.",
        "purport": " Hearing these prayers of the personified Vedas, in which the \u015brutis describe the Supersoul as entering countless varieties of material bodies, a critic may question how the Supreme can do this without becoming limited. Indeed, proponents of Advaita philosophy see no essential distinction between the Supreme Soul and His creation. In the impersonalists\u2019 conception, the Absolute has inexplicably gotten itself entrapped by illusion and has thus become first a personal God and then the demigods, humans, animals, plants and finally matter. \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya and his followers take great pains to cite Vedic evidence to support this theory of how illusion is imposed on the Absolute. But speaking for themselves, the Vedas here answer this objection and refuse to lend their authority to M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da impersonalism. The process of creation is technically called s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di, \u201csending forth.\u201d The Supreme Lord sends forth His variegated energies, and these partake of His nature while remaining distinct from Him. This fact is expressed in the true Vedic philosophy of acintya-bhed\u0101bheda, the inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference of the Supreme Lord and His energies. Thus although each of the multitude of individual souls is a distinct entity, all souls consist of the same spiritual substance as the Supreme. Since they partake of the Supreme Lord\u2019s spiritual essence, the j\u012bvas are unborn and eternal, just as He is. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, speaking to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, confirms this: \u201cNever was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.\u201d (Bg. 2.12) Material creation is a special arrangement for those j\u012bvas who choose to separate themselves from the Supreme Lord\u2019s service, and thus the creation involves producing an imitation world where they can try to be independent. After creating the many species of material life, the Supreme Lord expands into His own creation as the Supersoul in order to provide the intelligence and inspiration every living being needs for his day-to-day existence. As stated in the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.6.2), tat s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 tad ev\u0101nupr\u0101vi\u015bat: \u201cAfter creating this world, He then entered within it.\u201d The Lord enters the material world, however, without forming any binding connection to it; this the \u015brutis here declare by the phrase vi\u015bann iva, \u201conly seeming to enter.\u201d Taratamata\u015b cak\u0101ssi means that the Param\u0101tm\u0101 enters the body of every living being, from the great demigod Brahm\u0101 down to the insignificant germ, and exhibits differing degrees of His potency according to each soul\u2019s capacity for enlightenment. Analavat sva-k\u1e5bt\u0101nuk\u1e5bti\u1e25: Just as fire ignited in several objects burns according to the different forms of those objects, so the Supreme Soul, entering the bodies of all living creatures, illuminates the consciousness of each conditioned soul according to his individual capacity. Even in the midst of material creation and destruction, the Lord of all creatures remains eternally unchanged, as expressed here by the word eka-rasam. In other words, the Lord eternally maintains His personal form of immeasurable, unalloyed spiritual pleasure. The rare living beings who completely (abhitas) disengage themselves from material dealings, or pa\u1e47a (thereby becoming abhivipa\u1e47yava\u1e25), come to know the Supreme Lord as He is. Every intelligent person should follow the example of these great souls and beg from them the chance to also be engaged in the Supreme Lord\u2019s devotional service. This prayer is recited by \u015brutis whose mood is similar to that expressed in the following mantra of the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (6.11): \u201cThe one Supreme Lord lives hidden inside all created things. He pervades all matter and sits within the hearts of all living beings. As the indwelling Supersoul, He supervises their material activities. Thus, while having no material qualities Himself, He is the unique witness and giver of consciousness.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b submits his own prayer: \u201cLet us worship the Supreme Lord, who enters the products of His own creation yet remains aloof from their superior and inferior material gradations. He is the pure, undifferentiated existence pervading everything.\u201d"

Thus the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (3.10.5) proclaims, sa ya\u015b c\u0101ya\u1e41 puru\u1e63e ya\u015b c\u0101s\u0101v \u0101ditye sa eka\u1e25: \u201cThe soul of the embodied living being is one with Him who stands within the sun.\u201d Similarly, the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad (6.8.7) teaches, tat tvam asi: \u201cYou are nondifferent from that Supreme Truth.\u201d In this prayer, the personified Vedas refer to the finite enjoyer of material bodies (the j\u012bva soul) as an expansion of the transcendental reservoir of all potencies, the Supreme Lord. The term a\u1e41\u015ba-k\u1e5btam, \u201cmade as His portion,\u201d must be properly understood, however, in this context. The j\u012bva is not created at any time, nor is he the same kind of expansion of the Lord as the omnipotent vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva expansions. The Supreme Soul is the proper object of all worship, and the subordinate j\u012bva soul is meant to be His worshiper. The Supreme Lord enacts His pastimes by showing Himself in innumerable aspects of His personality, whereas the j\u012bva is forced to change bodies whenever his accumulated karmic reactions so dictate. According to \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra: \u201cThe marginal potency, who is spiritual by nature, who emanates from the self-cognizant sa\u1e41vit energy, and who becomes tainted by his attachment to the modes of material nature, is called the j\u012bva.\u201d Although the j\u012bva soul is also an expansion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is distinguished from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s independent Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions by his constitutional position on the margin between spirit and matter. As the Mah\u0101var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a explains, \u201cThe Supreme Lord is known in two ways: in terms of His plenary expansions and His separated expansions. Between the plenary expansions and Their source of expansion there is never any essential difference in terms of either Their capabilities, forms or situations. The separated expansions, on the other hand, possess only minute potency, being endowed only to a small extent with the Lord\u2019s powers.\u201d The conditioned soul in this world appears as if covered by matter, internally as well as externally. Externally, gross matter surrounds him in the forms of his body and environment, while internally desire and aversion impinge upon his consciousness. But from the transcendental perspective of realized sages, both kinds of material covering are insubstantial. By logically eliminating all material identities, which are misconceptions based on the soul\u2019s gross and subtle coverings, a thoughtful person can determine that the soul is nothing material. Rather, he is a pure spark of divine spirit, a servant of the Supreme Godhead. Understanding this, one should worship the Supreme Lord\u2019s lotus feet; such worship is the fully bloomed flower of the tree of Vedic rituals. One\u2019s realization of the splendor of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, gradually nourished by the offering of Vedic sacrifices, automatically bears the fruits of liberation from material existence and irrevocable faith in the Lord\u2019s mercy. One can accomplish all this while still living in the material world. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in the Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad (Uttara 47): \u201cOne who worships Me in My Deity form while living in the district of Mathur\u0101 or, indeed, anywhere in Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa, becomes most dear to Me in this world.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cMy Lord, please free me, Your partial expansion, from the bondage created by Your M\u0101y\u0101. Please do this, O abode of supreme bliss, by directing me to the service of Your feet.\u201d"

        "translation": "My Lord, some fortunate souls have gotten relief from the fatigue of material life by diving into the vast nectar ocean of Your pastimes, which You enact when You manifest Your personal forms to propagate the unfathomable science of the self. These rare souls, indifferent even to liberation, renounce the happiness of home and family because of their association with devotees who are like flocks of swans enjoying at the lotus of Your feet.",
        "purport": " Ritualistic br\u0101hma\u1e47as (sm\u0101rtas) and impersonalists (M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs) always try to relegate the process of bhakti-yoga to a relative or minor role. They say that devotion to the Personality of Godhead is for sentimental persons who lack the maturity to observe strict rituals or pursue the rigorous culture of knowledge. In this verse, however, the personified Vedas most emphatically declare the superexcellence of devotional service, clearly identifying it with \u0101tma-tattva, the science of the self that impersonalists so proudly claim as their own domain. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b here defines \u0101tma-tattva as the confidential mystery of the Supreme Lord\u2019s personal forms, qualities and pastimes. He also gives a second meaning for the phrase \u0101tta-tano\u1e25. Instead of meaning \u201cwho assumes various bodies,\u201d the phrase can also mean \u201cHe who attracts everyone to His transcendental body.\u201d The pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His various expansions and incarnations are an unfathomable ocean of enjoyment. When a person comes to the point of complete exhaustion in his materialistic pursuits \u2014 whether he has been searching after material success or some impersonal notion of spiritual annihilation \u2014 he can gain relief by submerging himself in this nectar. As \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b explains in his textbook on the science of bhakti-yoga, \u015ar\u012b Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (rendered into English by \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da as The Nectar of Devotion), one who tastes even a single drop of this vast ocean will forever lose all desire for anything else. Giving an alternative interpretation of the word pari\u015brama\u1e47\u0101\u1e25, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b comments that although the devotees of the Lord become fatigued after repeatedly diving into the endless waves and undercurrents in the ocean of the Lord\u2019s pleasure pastimes, these devotees never desire any happiness other than the Lord\u2019s service, even the happiness of liberation. Rather, their very fatigue becomes pleasure for them, just as the fatigue produced by sex indulgence is pleasurable to those addicted to sex. The Supreme Lord\u2019s pure devotees become enthused by hearing the charming narrations of His pastimes and feel impelled to dance, sing, shout out loud, kick their heels together, faint, sob and run about like madmen. Thus they become too absorbed in ecstasy to notice any bodily discomfort. Pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas do not want even liberation, what to speak of other desirable goals, such as an exalted position as ruler of the heavenly planets. This degree of exclusive dedication is admittedly only rarely achieved in this world, as the \u015brutis speaking this verse indicate by the word kecit (\u201ca few\u201d). Not only do pure devotees abandon their hankering for future gain, but they also lose all their attraction for what they already possess \u2014 the common comforts of home and family life. The association of saintly Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas \u2014 the disciplic succession of masters, disciples and granddisciples \u2014 becomes for them their real family, filled with swanlike personalities like \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. These great personalities always drink the sweet nectar of service to the Supreme Lord\u2019s lotus feet. Many mantras of the Upani\u1e63ads and other \u015brutis openly declare devotional service to be superior to liberation itself. In the words of the N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha-p\u016brva-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad, ya\u1e41 sarve ved\u0101 namanti mumuk\u1e63avo brahma-v\u0101dina\u015b ca: \u201cTo Him all the Vedas, all seekers of liberation and all students of the Absolute Truth offer their obeisances.\u201d Commenting on this mantra, \u015ar\u012b \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya admits, mukt\u0101 api l\u012blay\u0101 vigraha\u1e41 k\u1e5btv\u0101 bhajanti: \u201cEven liberated souls take pleasure in establishing the Supreme Lord\u2019s Deity and worshiping Him.\u201d The great rival of \u0100c\u0101rya \u015aa\u1e45kara, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya \u0100nandat\u012brtha, cites his own favorite \u015bruti-mantras in this regard, such as mukt\u0101 hy etam up\u0101sate, mukt\u0101n\u0101m api bhaktir hi param\u0101nanda-r\u016bpi\u1e47\u012b: \u201cEven those who are liberated worship Him, and even for them devotional service is the embodiment of supreme bliss\u201d; and am\u1e5btasya dh\u0101r\u0101 bahudh\u0101 doham\u0101na\u1e41/ cara\u1e47a\u1e41 no loke su-dhit\u0101\u1e41 dadh\u0101tu/ o\u1e41 tat sat: \u201cMay His feet, which bountifully pour forth floods of nectar, bestow wisdom upon us who are living in this world.\u201d In summary, \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cThose rare, fortunate souls who derive great delight by sporting in the nectar ocean of topics about You consider the four great goals of life [religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation] to be no more important than a blade of grass.\u201d"

But unfortunately, although You always show mercy to the conditioned souls and affectionately help them in every way, and although You are their true Self, people in general fail to delight in You. Instead they commit spiritual suicide by worshiping illusion. Alas, because they persistently hope for success in their devotion to the unreal, they continue to wander about this greatly fearful world, assuming various degraded bodies.",
        "purport": " The Vedas have strong words for those who choose to remain in illusion rather than serve the all-merciful Personality of Godhead. The B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (4.3.15) states, \u0101r\u0101mam asya pa\u015byanti na ta\u1e41 pa\u015byati ka\u015bcana; na tam vid\u0101tha ya im\u0101 jaj\u0101n\u0101nyad yu\u1e63m\u0101kam antaram babh\u016bva; n\u012bh\u0101re\u1e47a pr\u0101v\u1e5bt\u0101 jalpy\u0101 c\u0101su-t\u1e5bpa uktha-\u015b\u0101sa\u015b caranti: \u201cEveryone can see the place where the Lord manifested Himself in this world for His own pleasure, but still no one sees Him. None of you know Him who generated all these living beings, and thus there is a great difference between your vision and His. Covered by the fog of illusion, you performers of Vedic rituals indulge in useless talk and live only to gratify your senses.\u201d The Supreme Lord pervades this universe, as He says in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.4), may\u0101 tata\u1e41 ida\u1e41 sarva\u1e41 jagat. Nothing in this world, not even the most insignificant clay pot or shred of cloth, is devoid of the presence of the Personality of Godhead. But because He keeps Himself invisible to envious eyes (avyakta-m\u016brtin\u0101), materialists are misled by His material energy and think that the source of material creation is a combination of atoms and physical forces. Displaying their compassion for such foolish materialists, the personified Vedas advise them in this prayer to remember the real purpose for which they exist: to serve the Lord, their greatest well-wisher, with loving devotion. The human body is the ideal facility for reviving one\u2019s spiritual consciousness; its organs \u2014 ears, tongue, eyes and so on \u2014 are quite suitable for hearing about the Lord, chanting His glories, worshiping Him and performing all the other essential aspects of devotional service. One\u2019s material body is destined to remain intact for only a short time, and so it is called kul\u0101yam, subject to \u201cdissolving into the earth\u201d (kau l\u012byate). Nonetheless, if properly utilized it can be one\u2019s best friend. When one is immersed in material consciousness, however, the body becomes a false friend, distracting the bewildered living entity from his true self-interest. Persons too much infatuated with their own bodies and those of their spouses, children, pets and so on are in fact misdirecting their devotion to the worship of illusion, asad-up\u0101san\u0101. In this way, as the \u015brutis state here, such people commit spiritual suicide, insuring future punishment for failing to carry out the higher responsibilities of human existence. As the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad (3) declares: \u201cThe killer of the soul, whoever he may be, must enter into the planets known as the worlds of the faithless, full of darkness and ignorance.\u201d Those who are overly attached to sense gratification, or who worship the impermanent in the form of false, materialistic scriptures and philosophies, maintain desires that carry them into more degraded bodies in each successive life. Since they are entrapped in the perpetually rotating cycle of sa\u1e41s\u0101ra, their only hope for salvation is getting a chance to hear the merciful instructions spoken by the Supreme Lord\u2019s devotees. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cWhen will I receive a human birth in which my mind may take pleasure in You, who are the Supreme Soul and Lord of the universe?\u201d"

        "translation": "Simply by constantly thinking of Him, the enemies of the Lord attained the same Supreme Truth whom sages fixed in yoga worship by controlling their breath, mind and senses. Similarly, we \u015brutis, who generally see You as all-pervading, will achieve the same nectar from Your lotus feet that Your consorts are able to relish because of their loving attraction to Your mighty, serpentine arms, for You look upon us and Your consorts in the same way.",
        "purport": " According to \u0100c\u0101rya \u015ar\u012b J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the few \u015brutis \u2014 such as the Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad \u2014 who identify the cowherd boy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with absolute Brahman in its highest aspect had so far been patiently waiting for their turn to speak. But after hearing the other \u015brutis offer prayers openly glorifying the Lord\u2019s personality, these intimate \u015brutis could no longer contain themselves, and so they spoke out of turn in this verse. Followers of the path of mystic yoga subdue their senses and minds by practicing breath control and severe austerities. If they succeed in thoroughly purifying themselves by this regimen, they may eventually begin to realize the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the personal form of Brahman within the heart. And if they continue this meditation without deviation for a long time, they may in the end come to the point of true God consciousness. But the same objective achieved in this difficult and uncertain way was also attained by the demons who were killed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a during His pastimes on the earth. Obsessed with enmity toward Him, demons like Ka\u1e41sa and \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la quickly obtained the perfection of liberation simply by His killing them. Speaking for themselves, however, the personified Vedas here state that they would prefer to develop love of Godhead by learning to emulate the favorable surrender of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s confidential devotees, especially the young gop\u012bs of Vraja. Though they appeared to be simple women attracted conjugally to the Lord\u2019s physical beauty and strength, the goddesses of Vraja exhibited the highest perfection of meditation. The \u015brutis wish to become just like them. In this regard, Lord Brahm\u0101 relates the following historical account in the supplement to the B\u1e5bhad-v\u0101mana Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cThe infinite world of spiritual bliss is called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. There the Supreme Truth lives, being glorified by the personified Vedas, who are also present there.\u201d \u201cOnce, after the Vedas had elaborately praised Him, the Lord felt especially satisfied and spoke to them in a voice whose source remained invisible: \u2018My dear sages, I am very satisfied with you. Please ask of Me some benediction that you secretly desire.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe \u015brutis replied, \u2018We have developed the desire to become like the cowherd women of the mortal world who, inspired by lust, worship You in the mood of a lover.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe Lord then said, \u2018This desire of Yours is difficult to fulfill. Indeed, it is almost impossible. But since I am sanctioning it, your wish must inevitably come true.\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018When the next Brahm\u0101 takes birth to faithfully execute his duties of creation, and when the day of his life called the S\u0101rasvata-kalpa arrives, you will all appear in Vraja as gop\u012bs.\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018On the earth, in the land of Bh\u0101rata, in My own district of Mathur\u0101, in the forest of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, I will become your beloved in the circle of the r\u0101sa dance.\u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018Thus obtaining Me as your paramour, you will all gain the most exalted and steadfast pure love for Me, and in this way you will fulfill all your ambitions.\u2019\u201d \u201cLord Brahm\u0101 said: After hearing these words, the \u015brutis meditated on the Personality of Godhead\u2019s beauty for a long time. When the designated time ultimately arrived, they became gop\u012bs and obtained the association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d A similar account can be found in the S\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di-kha\u1e47\u1e0da of the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, which describes how the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra also became a gop\u012b. Regarding the development of bhakti, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a further states in the Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad (Uttara 4), ap\u016bta\u1e25 p\u016bto bhavati ya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 sm\u1e5btv\u0101, avrat\u012b vrat\u012b bhavati ya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 sm\u1e5btv\u0101, ni\u1e63k\u0101ma\u1e25 sa-k\u0101mo bhavati ya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 sm\u1e5btv\u0101, a\u015brotr\u012b \u015brotr\u012b bhavati ya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 sm\u1e5btv\u0101: \u201cBy remembering Me, one who is impure becomes pure. By remembering Me, one who follows no vows becomes a strict follower of vows. By remembering Me, one who is desireless develops desires [to serve Me]. By remembering Me, one who has studied no Vedic mantras becomes an expert knower of the Vedas.\u201d The B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (4.5.6) refers to the gradual steps in the process of becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious: \u0100tm\u0101 v\u0101 are dra\u1e63\u1e6davya\u1e25 \u015brotavyo mantavyo nididhy\u0101sitavya\u1e25. \u201cIt is the Self which must be observed, heard about, thought of and meditated upon with fixed concentration.\u201d The idea here is that one should realize the Supreme Self as directly visible in His full personality by the following means: First one should hear the instructions of a qualified representative of the Param\u0101tm\u0101 and take the words of such a spiritual master into one\u2019s heart by offering him humble service and striving in all ways to please him. One should then ponder the divine message of the spiritual master continuously, with the aim of dispelling all one\u2019s doubts and misconceptions. Then one can proceed to meditate on the Supreme Lord\u2019s lotus feet with total conviction and determination. So-called j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs may think that the Upani\u1e63ads praise nirvi\u015be\u1e63a (impersonal) realization of the Supreme as more complete and final than sa-vi\u015be\u1e63a (personal) worship of the Supreme Godhead. All honest Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, however, join in adhering to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord, always meditating with pleasure on His infinitely wonderful, variegated spiritual qualities. In the words of the \u015bruti-mantras, yam evai\u1e63a v\u1e5b\u1e47ute tena labhyas/ tasyai\u1e63a \u0101tm\u0101 viv\u1e5b\u1e47ute tan\u016b\u1e41 sv\u0101m: \u201cTo that person whom the Supreme Soul chooses, He becomes attainable. To that person the Supreme Soul reveals His personal form.\u201d (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.2.23 and Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 3.2.3) \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b concludes with the prayer, \u201cO Lord, loving remembrance of Your lotus feet is very rarely achieved. Please, O N\u1e5bhari, somehow arrange for me to have that remembrance day and night.\u201d"

So how can anyone here know Him who existed prior to everything else and who gave rise to the first learned sage, Brahm\u0101, and all subsequent demigods, both lesser and greater? When He lies down and withdraws everything within Himself, nothing else remains \u2014 no gross or subtle matter or bodies composed of these, no force of time or revealed scripture.",
        "purport": " Here the \u015brutis express the difficulty of knowing the Supreme. Devotional service, or bhakti-yoga, as described in these prayers of the personified Vedas, is the surest and easiest path to knowledge of the Lord and to liberation. In comparison, the philosophic search for knowledge, known as j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, is very difficult, favored though it is by those who are disgusted with material life but still unwilling to surrender to the Lord. As long as the finite soul remains envious of the Lord\u2019s supremacy, the Lord does not reveal Himself. As He states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.25): \u201cI am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible.\u201d And in the words of Lord Brahm\u0101, \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, only the tip of the toe of whose lotus feet is approached by the yog\u012bs, who aspire after the transcendental and betake themselves to pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma by drilling the respiration; or by the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, who search out the undifferentiated Brahman by the process of elimination of the mundane, extending over thousands of millions of years.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.34) Brahm\u0101, the first-born living being in this universe, is also the foremost sage. He is born from Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and from him appear the hosts of demigods, including both the controllers of earthly activities and the rulers of heaven. All these powerful and intelligent beings are relatively recent productions of the Lord\u2019s creative energy. As the first speaker of the Vedas, Lord Brahm\u0101 should know their purport at least as well as any other authority, but even he knows the Personality of Godhead only to a limited extent. As \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam states (1.3.35), veda-guhy\u0101ni h\u1e5bt-pate\u1e25: \u201cThe Lord of the heart hides Himself deep within the confidential recesses of the Vedic sound.\u201d If Brahm\u0101 and the demigods born from him cannot easily know the Supreme Lord, how then can mere mortals expect success in their independent pursuit of knowledge? As long as this creation lasts, living beings face many obstacles on the path of knowledge. Because of identifying themselves with their material coverings, consisting of body, mind and ego, they acquire all sorts of prejudices and misconceptions. Even if they have the divine scripture to guide them and the opportunity to execute the prescribed methods of karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga, the conditioned souls have but little power for gaining knowledge of the Absolute. And when the time of annihilation comes, the Vedic scriptures and their regulative injunctions become unmanifest, leaving the dormant j\u012bvas completely in darkness. Therefore we should abandon our futile endeavors for knowledge without devotion and simply surrender ourselves to the Supreme Lord\u2019s mercy, heeding the advice of Lord Brahm\u0101: \u201cThose who, even while remaining situated in their established social positions, throw away the process of speculative knowledge and with their body, words and mind offer all respects to descriptions of Your personality and activities, dedicating their lives to these narrations, which are vibrated by You personally and by Your pure devotees, certainly conquer Your Lordship, although You are otherwise unconquerable by anyone within the three worlds.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.3) In this regard, the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.4.1) refers to the Supreme as yato v\u0101co nivartante apr\u0101pya manas\u0101 saha, \u201cwhere words cease, and where the mind cannot reach.\u201d The \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad (4) states: \u201cAlthough fixed in His abode, the Personality of Godhead is more swift than the mind and can overcome all others running. The powerful demigods cannot approach Him. Although in one place, He controls those who supply the air and rain. He surpasses all in excellence.\u201d And in the \u1e5ag Veda (3.54.5) we find this mantra: \u201cWho in this world actually knows, and who can explain, whence this creation has come? The demigods, after all, are younger than the creation. Who, then, can tell whence this world has come into being?\u201d \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b thus prays: \u201cWhat am I, a being entrapped by the material coverings of worldly intelligence and so on? And what are Your glories by comparison, O almighty one? O friend of the fallen, O ocean of mercy, Lord N\u1e5bhari, please bless me with Your devotional service.\u201d"

        "translation": "Supposed authorities who declare that matter is the origin of existence, that the permanent qualities of the soul can be destroyed, that the self is compounded of separate aspects of spirit and matter, or that material transactions constitute reality \u2014 all such authorities base their teachings on mistaken ideas that hide the truth. The dualistic conception that the living entity is produced from the three modes of nature is simply a product of ignorance. Such a conception has no real basis in You, for You are transcendental to all illusion and always enjoy perfect, total awareness.",
        "purport": " The true position of the Supreme Personality is a sublime mystery, as is also the dependent position of the j\u012bva soul. Most thinkers are mistaken in one way or another about these truths, since there are countless varieties of false designation that can cover the soul and create illusion. Foolish conditioned souls submit to obvious delusions, but the illusory power of M\u0101y\u0101 can easily subvert the intelligence of even the most sophisticated philosophers and mystics. Thus there are always divergent schools of thought propounding conflicting theories concerning basic principles of truth. In traditional Indian philosophy, the followers of Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, Ny\u0101ya, S\u0101\u1e45khya, Yoga and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 philosophies all have their own erroneous ideas, which the personified Vedas point out in this prayer. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas say that the visible universe is created from an original stock of atoms (janim asata\u1e25). As Ka\u1e47\u0101da \u1e5a\u1e63i\u2019s Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btras (7.1.20) state, nitya\u1e41 parima\u1e47\u1e0dalam: \u201cThat which is of the smallest size, the atom, is eternal.\u201d Ka\u1e47\u0101da and his followers also postulate eternality for other, nonatomic entities, including the souls who become embodied, and even a Supreme Soul. But in Vai\u015be\u1e63ika cosmology the souls and the Supersoul play only token roles in the atomic production of the universe. \u015ar\u012bla K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-dvaip\u0101yana Vedavy\u0101sa criticizes this position in his Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras (2.2.12): ubhayath\u0101pi na karm\u0101tas tad-abh\u0101va\u1e25. According to this s\u016btra, one cannot claim that, at the time of creation, atoms first combine together because they are impelled by some karmic impulse adhering in the atoms themselves, since atoms by themselves, in their primeval state before combining into complex objects, have no ethical responsibility that might lead them to acquire pious and sinful reactions. Nor can the initial combination of atoms be explained as a result of the residual karma of the living entities who lie dormant prior to creation, since these reactions are each j\u012bva\u2019s own and cannot be transferred from them even to other j\u012bvas, what to speak of inert atoms. Alternatively, the phrase janim asata\u1e25 can be taken to allude to the Yoga philosophy of Pata\u00f1jali \u1e5a\u1e63i, inasmuch as his Yoga-s\u016btras teach one how to achieve the transcendental status of Brahmanhood by a mechanical process of exercise and meditation. Pata\u00f1jali\u2019s yoga method is here called asat because it ignores the essential aspect of devotion \u2014 surrender to the will of the Supreme Person. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (17.28): \u201cAnything done as sacrifice, charity or penance without faith in the Supreme, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, is impermanent. It is called asat and is useless both in this life and in the next.\u201d The Yoga-s\u016btras acknowledge the Personality of Godhead in an oblique way, but only as a helper whom the advancing yog\u012b can utilize. \u012a\u015bvara-pra\u1e47idh\u0101n\u0101d v\u0101: \u201cDevotional meditation on God is yet another means of achieving concentration.\u201d (Yoga-s\u016btra 1.23) In contrast, B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a Vedavy\u0101sa\u2019s philosophy of Ved\u0101nta emphasizes devotional service not only as the primary means to liberation but also as identical with liberation itself. \u0100-pr\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101t tatr\u0101pi hi d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam: \u201cWorship of the Lord continues up to the point of liberation, and indeed goes on in the liberated state also, as the Vedas reveal.\u201d (Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra 4.1.12) Gautama \u1e5a\u1e63i, in his Ny\u0101ya-sutras, proposes that one can attain liberation by negating both illusion and unhappiness: du\u1e25kha-janma-prav\u1e5btti-do\u1e63a-mithy\u0101-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101n\u0101m uttarottar\u0101p\u0101ye tad-anantar\u0101bh\u0101v\u0101d apavarga\u1e25. \u201cBy successively dispelling false conceptions, bad character, entangling action, rebirth and misery \u2014 the disappearance of one of these allowing the disappearance of the next \u2014 one can achieve final liberation.\u201d (Ny\u0101ya-sutra 1.1.2) But since Ny\u0101ya philosophers believe that awareness is not an essential quality of the soul, they teach that a liberated soul has no consciousness. The Ny\u0101ya idea of liberation thus puts the soul in the condition of a dead stone. This attempt by the Ny\u0101ya philosophers to kill the soul\u2019s innate consciousness is here called sato m\u1e5btim by the personified Vedas. But the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (2.3.17) unequivocally states, j\u00f1o\u00a0\u2019ta eva: \u201cThe j\u012bva soul is always a knower.\u201d Although the soul is in truth both conscious and active, the proponents of S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy wrongly separate these two functions of the living force (\u0101tmani ye ca bhid\u0101m), ascribing consciousness to the soul (puru\u1e63a) and activity to material nature (prak\u1e5bti). According to the S\u0101\u1e45khya-k\u0101rik\u0101 (19-20): \u201cThus, since the apparent differences between puru\u1e63as are only superficial (being due to the various modes of nature that cover them), the puru\u1e63a\u2019s true status is proven to be that of a witness, characterized by his separateness, his passive indifference, his status of being an observer, and his inactivity.\u201d \u201cThus, by contact with the soul, the unconscious subtle body seems to be conscious, while the soul appears to be the doer although he is aloof from the activity of nature\u2019s modes.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva refutes this idea in the section of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (2.3.31-39) that begins, kart\u0101 \u015b\u0101str\u0101rtha-vattv\u0101t: \u201cThe j\u012bva soul must be a performer of actions, because the injunctions of scripture must have some purpose.\u201d \u0100c\u0101rya Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a, in his Govinda-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, explains: \u201cThe j\u012bva, not the modes of nature, is the doer. Why? Because the injunctions of scripture must have some purpose (\u015b\u0101str\u0101rtha-vattv\u0101t). For example, such scriptural injunctions as svarga-k\u0101mo yajeta (\u2018One who desires to attain to heaven should perform ritual sacrifice\u2019) and \u0101tm\u0101nam eva lokam up\u0101s\u012bta (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 1.4.15: \u2018One should worship with the aim of attaining the spiritual kingdom\u2019) are meaningful only if a conscious doer exists. If the modes of nature were the doer, these statements would serve no purpose. After all, scriptural injunctions engage the living entity in performing prescribed actions by convincing him that he can act to bring about certain enjoyable results. Such a mentality cannot be aroused in the inert modes of nature.\u201d Jaimini \u1e5a\u1e63i, in his P\u016brva-m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101-s\u016btras, presents material work and its results as the whole of reality (vipa\u1e47am \u1e5btam). He and later proponents of Karma-m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 philosophy teach that material existence is endless \u2014 that there is no liberation. For them the cycle of karma is perpetual, and the best one can aim for is higher birth among the demigods. Therefore, they say, the whole purpose of the Vedas is to engage human beings in rituals for creating good karma, and consequently the mature soul\u2019s prime responsibility is to ascertain the exact meaning of the Vedas\u2019 sacrificial injunctions and to execute them. Codan\u0101-lak\u1e63a\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019rtho dharma\u1e25: \u201cDuty is that which is indicated by the injunctions of the Vedas.\u201d (P\u016brva-m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101-s\u016btra 1.1.2) The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, however \u2014 especially in the Fourth Chapter, which deals with life\u2019s ultimate goal \u2014 elaborately describes the soul\u2019s potential for achieving liberation from birth and death, while it subordinates ritual sacrifice to the role of helping one become qualified to receive spiritual knowledge. As stated there (Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra 4.1.16), agnihotr\u0101di tu tat-k\u0101ry\u0101yaiva tad-dar\u015ban\u0101t: \u201cThe Agnihotra and other Vedic sacrifices are meant only for producing knowledge, as the statements of the Vedas show.\u201d And the very last words of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (4.4.22) proclaim, an\u0101v\u1e5btti\u1e25 \u015babd\u0101t: \u201cThe liberated soul never returns to this world, as promised by the revealed scripture.\u201d Thus the fallacious conclusions of the speculative philosophers prove that even great scholars and sages are often bewildered by the misuse of their own God-given intelligence. As the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (1.2.5) says: \u201cCaught in the grip of ignorance, self-proclaimed experts consider themselves learned authorities. They wander about this world befooled, like the blind leading the blind.\u201d Of the six orthodox philosophies of Vedic tradition \u2014 S\u0101\u1e45khya, Yoga, Ny\u0101ya, Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 and Ved\u0101nta \u2014 only the Ved\u0101nta of B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a Vy\u0101sa is free of error, and even that only as properly explained by the bona fide Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas. Each of the six schools, nonetheless, makes some practical contribution to Vedic education: atheistic S\u0101\u1e45khya explains the evolution of natural elements from subtle to gross, Pata\u00f1jali\u2019s yoga describes the eightfold method of meditation, Ny\u0101ya sets forth the techniques of logic, Vai\u015be\u1e63ika considers the basic metaphysical categories of reality, and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 establishes the standard tools of scriptural interpretation. Apart from these six, there are also the more deviant philosophies of the Buddhists, Jains and C\u0101rv\u0101kas, whose theories of voidism and materialism deny the spiritual integrity of the eternal soul. Ultimately, the only perfectly reliable source of knowledge is God Himself. The Personality of Godhead is avabodha-rasa, the infinite reservoir of unfailing vision. To those who depend on Him with absolute conviction, He grants the divine eye of knowledge. Others, following their own speculative theories, must grope for the truth through the obscuring curtain of M\u0101y\u0101. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cFor the bewildered soul wandering within the darkness of those exalted philosophies promoted by the harsh methods of false logic, the path of true knowledge of You, O Lord of magnificent glory, remains invisible. O Lord of Madhu, husband of the goddess of fortune, when will I become liberated by joyfully chanting Your names \u2014 M\u0101dhava, V\u0101mana, Trinayana, \u015ar\u012b \u015aa\u1e45kara, \u015ar\u012bpati and Govinda?\u201d"

Although these phenomena appear real, they are only a false reflection of the spiritual reality, being a superimposition of the mind upon You. Still, those who know the Supreme Self consider the entire material creation to be real inasmuch as it is nondifferent from the Self. Just as things made of gold are indeed not to be rejected, since their substance is actual gold, so this world is undoubtedly nondifferent from the Lord who created it and then entered within it.",
        "purport": " In one sense the visible world is real (sat), while in another it is not (asat). The substance of this universe is solid fact, being the Lord\u2019s external energy, but the forms that M\u0101y\u0101 imposes on this substance are only temporary. And because material forms are temporary manifestations, those who consider them permanent are in illusion. Impersonalistic scholars, however, misinterpret this division of sat and asat; denying commonsense reality, they declare that not only material form but also material substance is unreal, and they confuse their own spiritual essence with that of the Absolute Whole. A M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosopher would take the words spoken by the personified Vedas in the preceding prayer \u2014 tri-gu\u1e47a-maya\u1e25 pum\u0101n iti bhid\u0101 \u2014 as negating any distinction between the Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the j\u012bva soul. He would claim that since the j\u012bva\u2019s material embodiment is an ephemeral display of the three modes of nature, when the j\u012bva\u2019s ignorance is destroyed by knowledge, he becomes the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Soul; bondage, liberation and the manifest world are all unreal creations of ignorance. In response to such ideas, the Vedas here clarify the factual relationship between sat and asat. In the \u015bruti literature we find this statement: asato\u00a0\u2019dhimano\u00a0\u2019s\u1e5bjyata, mana\u1e25 praj\u0101patim as\u1e5bjat, praj\u0101pati\u1e25 praj\u0101 as\u1e5bjat, tad v\u0101 ida\u1e41 manasy eva parama\u1e41 prati\u1e63\u1e6dhita\u1e41 yad ida\u1e41 ki\u1e41 ca. \u201cThe supreme mind was originally created from asat. This mind created Praj\u0101pati, and Praj\u0101pati created all living beings. Thus mind alone is the ultimate foundation of everything that exists in this world.\u201d Although impersonalists might misread this to mean that all manifest existence is based on the unreality of illusion (asat), the apparently contrary use of the word asat in this passage actually refers to the original cause, the Supreme Godhead, because He is transcendental to material existence (sat). The logic of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (2.1.17) corroborates this interpretation while denying the wrong interpretation of the impersonalists: asad-vyapade\u015b\u0101n neti cen na dharm\u0101ntare\u1e47a v\u0101kya-\u015be\u1e63\u0101t. \u201cIf one objects that the material world and its source cannot be of one substance because the world has been called unreal, we reply, \u2018No, because the statement that Brahman is asat makes sense in terms of His having qualities distinct from those of the creation.\u2019\u201d Thus the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.7.1) declares, asad v\u0101 idam agra \u0101s\u012bt: \u201cIn the beginning of this creation, only asat was present.\u201d In the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the word adhimana\u1e25 in the passage quoted above refers to the ruler of the aggregate mind of the universe, Lord Aniruddha, who appears as a plenary expansion of \u015ar\u012b N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a when the latter desires to create. Praj\u0101pati is Brahm\u0101, the father of all other created beings. This is described in the Mah\u0101-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a Upani\u1e63ad (1.4): atha punar eva n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 so\u00a0\u2019nya\u1e41 k\u0101ma\u1e41 manas\u0101 dhy\u0101yet; tasya dhy\u0101n\u0101nta\u1e25-sthasya lalan\u0101t svedo\u00a0\u2019patat; t\u0101 im\u0101 pratat\u0101pa t\u0101su tejo hira\u1e47-mayam a\u1e47\u1e0da\u1e41 tatra brahm\u0101 catur-mukho\u00a0\u2019j\u0101yata. \u201cThen Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a meditated upon another desire of His, and as He pondered, a drop of perspiration fell from His forehead. All the material creations evolved from the fermentation of this drop. Therein the fiery, golden egg of the universe appeared, and within that globe four-headed Brahm\u0101 took his birth.\u201d When a particular object is manufactured, it appears as a transformation of its ingredient cause, as in the case of jewelry made from gold. Persons who want gold will not reject gold earrings or necklaces, since these items are still gold, despite their modification. True j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs see in this mundane example an analogy to the different-yet-nondifferent relationship of the Puru\u1e63a and His emanations, both material and spiritual. Thus this transcendental knowledge frees them from the bondage of illusion, for they can then see the Lord throughout His creation. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cLet us worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by virtue of whose substantial existence this created world seems to exist perpetually, although it is essentially insubstantial. As the Supersoul, He constitutes the representation of the real within this unreality.\u201d"

        "translation": "The devotees who worship You as the shelter of all beings disregard Death and place their feet on his head. But with the words of the Vedas You bind the nondevotees like animals, though they be vastly learned scholars. It is Your affectionate devotees who can purify themselves and others, not those who are inimical to You.",
        "purport": " The personified Vedas have now set aside the erroneous philosophies of several contending schools: the asad-utpatti-v\u0101da of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas, who presume a material source of creation; the sad-vin\u0101\u015ba-vada of the Naiy\u0101yikas, who would deprive the liberated soul of consciousness; the sagu\u1e47atva-bheda-v\u0101da of the S\u0101\u1e45khyas, who isolate the soul from all his apparent qualities; the vipa\u1e47a-v\u0101da of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas, who condemn the soul to eternal involvement in the mundane commerce of karma; and the vivarta-v\u0101da of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, who denigrate the soul\u2019s real life in this world as a hallucination. Having rejected all these ideas, the personified Vedas now present the philosophy of devotional service, paricary\u0101-v\u0101da. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas who accept this philosophy teach that the j\u012bva soul is an atomic particle of spiritual personality who possesses minute knowledge, is not independent and has no material qualities. Being minute, he is prone to come under the control of the material energy, where he suffers the pains of material life. He can end his suffering and regain the shelter of the Supreme Lord\u2019s divine, internal energy only by rendering devotional service to the Lord, not by engaging in fruitive work, mental speculation or any other process. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in His own words, \u201cOnly by practicing unalloyed devotional service with full faith in Me can one obtain Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am naturally dear to My devotees, who take Me as the only goal of their loving service. By engaging in such pure devotional service, even the dog-eaters can purify themselves from the contamination of their low birth.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.14.21) Devotees of the Personality of Godhead worship Him as the shelter (niketa) of everything that exists (akhila-sattva). Moreover, these Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotees themselves can be called akhila-sattva-niketa in the sense that their abode and shelter is the philosophic truth of the reality (sattvam) of both the material and spiritual worlds. Thus \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, in his Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, quotes the \u015bruti-mantra: satya\u1e41 hy eveda\u1e41 vi\u015bvam as\u1e5bjata. \u201cHe created this world as real.\u201d And the Seventh Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (7.1.11) refers to the Supreme Lord as pradh\u0101na-pumbhy\u0101\u1e41 naradeva satya-k\u1e5bt, \u201cthe creator of a real universe of matter and living entities.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura points out yet another, more confidential, meaning of akhila-sattva-niketa: that the Supreme Lord\u2019s personal abodes are in no way khila, or imperfect, and so are called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, the realms free of anxiety and restriction. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas whose devotional service the Lord has kindly accepted are so sure of His protection that they no longer fear death, which becomes for them just another easy step on the way back to their eternal home. But are only devotees of the Supreme Lord eligible for liberation from the fear of death? Why are all other mystics and learned scholars disqualified? Here the \u015brutis answer: \u201cAnyone who is vimukha, who has not turned his face toward the Lord with hopeful expectation of His mercy, is bound up in illusion by the same words of the Vedas that enlighten the surrendered devotees.\u201d The Vedas themselves warn, tasya v\u0101k-tantir n\u0101m\u0101ni d\u0101m\u0101ni; tasyeda\u1e41 v\u0101c\u0101 tanty\u0101 n\u0101mabhir d\u0101mabhi\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 sitam: \u201cThe threads of this transcendental sound form a string of sacred names, but also a set of binding ropes. With the rope of their injunctions, the Vedas tie up this entire world, leaving all beings fettered by false designations.\u201d The reality of the soul and Supersoul is aparok\u1e63a, perceivable, but only to one with transcendental vision. Philosophers whose hearts are impure mistakenly presume that this truth is instead parok\u1e63a, that it can only be speculated upon and never experienced directly. The knowledge of such thinkers may help them dispel certain doubts and misconceptions about the lesser aspects of reality, but it is useless for transcending material illusion and approaching the Absolute Truth. As a general rule, only the devotees who faithfully render loving service unto the Supreme Lord up to the point of complete purification receive His grace in the form of aparok\u1e63a-j\u00f1\u0101na, direct realization of His greatness and wonderful compassion. The Personality of Godhead is of course free to award His mercy even to the undeserving, as He does when He personally kills offensive demons, but He is much less inclined to bless M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and other atheistic philosophers. One should not think, however, that the devotees of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are ignorant because they may not be expert in philosophic analysis and argument. The soul\u2019s perfect realization is to be gained not through his own efforts at mental speculation but by receiving the Lord\u2019s favor. This we hear from Vedic authority (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.23 and Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 3.2.3): \u201cThis Supreme Self cannot be reached by argumentation, or by applying one\u2019s independent brain power, or by studying many scriptures. Rather, he alone can achieve the Self whom the Self chooses to favor. To that person the Self reveals His own true, personal form.\u201d Elsewhere the \u015bruti describes the devotee\u2019s success: deh\u0101nte deva\u1e25 para\u1e41 brahma t\u0101raka\u1e41 vyaca\u1e63\u1e6de. \u201cAt the end of this body\u2019s life, the sanctified soul perceives the Supreme Lord just as clearly as if seeing the stars in the sky.\u201d And in its last statement, the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (6.23) offers this encouragement to aspiring Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas: \u201cUnto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed.\u201d In this regard \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b cites other verses of \u015ar\u012b \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (4.7-8 and 4.13): \u201cThe Supreme Lord is He who is referred to by the mantras of the \u1e5ag Veda, who resides in the topmost, eternal sky, and who elevates His saintly devotees to share that same position. One who has developed pure love for Him and realizes His uniqueness then appreciates His glories and is freed from sorrow. What further good can the \u1e5ag mantras bestow on one who knows that Supreme Lord? All who come to know Him achieve the supreme destination.\u201d \u201cTo Him who is the master of all the Vedas, in whom all planets rest, who is the Lord of all known creatures, both the two-legged and the four-legged \u2014 to Him, the Personality of Godhead, we offer our worship with oblations of ghee.\u201d Referring to those who desire liberation, \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cLet them suffer austerities, throw themselves from mountaintops, travel to holy places, study the scriptures, worship with fire sacrifices and argue various philosophies, but without Lord Hari they will never cross beyond death.\u201d"

        "purport": " All intelligent living beings should acknowledge the sovereignty of the Lord and willingly engage in devotional service to Him. Such is the consensus of the personified Vedas. But Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, while hearing these prayers, may have reasonably asked, \u201cSince I also have a bodily form with sense organs and limbs, am I not just another doer and enjoyer? Especially since as the Supersoul in every being\u2019s heart I supervise countless organs and limbs, how am I not implicated in the sum total of everyone\u2019s sense gratification?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d the assembled \u015brutis here rejoin, \u201cYou have no material senses, yet You are the absolute controller of all.\u201d As expressed in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.19): \u201cHe has no feet or hands, yet He is the swiftest runner and can grasp anything. Though without eyes or ears, He sees and hears. Nobody knows Him, yet He is the knower and the object of knowledge. Sages describe Him as the supreme, original Personality of Godhead.\u201d The hands, feet, eyes and ears of the Supreme Person are not like those of an ordinary, conditioned soul, which are derived from false ego, a material substance. Rather, the Lord\u2019s transcendentally beautiful features are direct manifestations of His internal nature. Thus, unlike the soul and body of conditioned living beings, the Lord and His bodily form are identical in all respects. Moreover, His lotus hands, lotus feet, lotus eyes and other limbs are not restricted in their functions. \u015ar\u012b Brahm\u0101, the Lord\u2019s first creature, glorifies Him on this account: \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental form is full of bliss, truth and substantiality and thus emanates the most dazzling splendor. Each of the limbs of that transcendental figure possesses in itself the full-fledged functions of all the organs, and He eternally sees, maintains and manifests the infinite universes, both spiritual and material.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.32) \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b gives an alternative explanation of the phrase akhila-\u015bakti-dhara: The power that the Supreme Lord maintains within Himself is akhila, free from the limitations of all that is khila, or inferior and insignificant. He energizes the living being\u2019s senses, as described by the Kena Upani\u1e63ad (1.2): \u015arotrasya \u015brotra\u1e41 manaso mano yad v\u0101co ha v\u0101cam. \u201cHe is the ear\u2019s ear, the mind\u2019s mind, and the voice\u2019s capacity of speech.\u201d And the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (6.8) declares: \u201cHe has no material work to perform, nor any material senses with which to perform it. No one can be found who is equal to or greater than Him. From the Vedas we hear how that Supreme Lord possesses multifarious energies \u2014 the potencies of knowledge, strength and action \u2014 each of which acts autonomously.\u201d Indra and the other demigods who rule over mortal beings are themselves servants of the Personality of Godhead, as are their superiors \u2014 Brahm\u0101 and his sons, the secondary creators. All of these great gods and sages worship the Supreme Lord by performing their respective services of managing the universe and providing religious guidance for mankind. The powerful controllers of the universe submit themselves in fearful reverence to the supreme controller, Lord \u015ar\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. As the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.8.1) states: \u201cOut of fear of Him, the wind blows. Out fear of Him, the sun moves and Agni and Indra execute their duties. And death, the fifth of their number, races along out of fear of Him.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cThe Supreme Lord has no material senses, yet He controls every living entity\u2019s sensory functions. He is the knower of everything, the ultimate performer of all action, and everyone\u2019s proper object of devotional service. I offer my obeisances to Him.\u201d"

        "purport": " Not only are living beings totally dependent on the all-powerful, independent Lord for their maintenance and welfare, but even the very fact of their embodied existence is due only to His exceptional mercy. The Personality of Godhead has no interest in material affairs, since He has nothing to gain from the petty pleasures of this world and is altogether free from any contamination of envy or lust. He is exclusively involved in confidential, loving pastimes with His pure devotees in the internal realm of His spiritual energies. Therefore the only reason He ever turns to the business of material creation is to help draw lost souls back into this inner circle of eternal enjoyment. To attempt a life separate from the Lord, rebellious souls must be provided with suitable bodies and an illusory environment in which to act out their fantasies of independence. The merciful Lord agrees to let them learn in their own way, and so He glances at Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, His energy of material creation. Simply by this glance, she is awakened and makes all required arrangements on His behalf. She and her helpers manufacture countless varieties of gross and subtle bodies of demigods, humans, animals and so on, along with countless situations in heavenly and hellish worlds \u2014 all just to give the conditioned souls the exact facilities they desire and deserve. While the uninformed may blame God for the suffering of His creatures, a sincere student of the Vedic literature will come to appreciate the Supreme Lord\u2019s equal concern for each soul. Since He has nothing to lose or gain, there is no reason for Him to distinguish between friends and opponents. We may choose to oppose Him and make all endeavors to forget Him, but He never forgets us, nor does He ever stop providing us with all our necessities, along with His unseen guidance. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cO Father, O Lord appearing as half man, half lion, please save those who have been born into the endless cycle of birth and death.

        "purport": " Because the conditioned soul cannot directly understand the Supreme, the Vedas commonly refer to that Supreme Truth in such impersonal terms as Brahman and o\u1e41 tat sat. If an ordinary scholar presumes to know the confidential meaning of these symbolic references, he should be rejected as an imposter. In the words of \u015ar\u012b Kena Upani\u1e63ad (2.1), yadi manyase su-vedeti dabhram ev\u0101pi n\u016bna\u1e41 tva\u1e41 vettha brahma\u1e47o r\u016bpa\u1e41, yad asya tva\u1e41 yad asya deve\u1e63u: \u201cIf you think you know Brahman well, then your knowledge is very meager. If you think you can identify Brahman\u2019s form from among the demigods, indeed you know but little.\u201d And again: \u201cWhoever denies having any opinion of his own about the Supreme Truth is correct in his opinion, whereas one who has his own opinion about the Supreme does not know Him. He is unknown to those who claim to know Him, and can only be known by those who do not claim to know Him.\u201d (Kena Upani\u1e63ad 2.3) \u0100c\u0101rya \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b gives the following explanation of this verse: Many philosophers have studied the mysteries of life from various perspectives and have formed widely differing theories. The Advaita M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, for example, propose that there is only one living being and one power of illusion (avidy\u0101) that covers him, producing the appearance of plurality. But this hypothesis leads to the absurd conclusion that when any one living being becomes liberated, everyone obtains liberation. If, on the other hand, there are many avidy\u0101s to cover the one living being, each avidy\u0101 will cover only some part of him, and we would have to talk about his becoming partly liberated at particular times while his other parts remain in bondage. This is also obviously absurd. Thus the plurality of living beings is an unavoidable conclusion. Furthermore, there are other theoreticians, namely the proponents of Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, who claim that the j\u012bva soul is infinite in size. If souls were infinitesimal, these scholars argue, they would not pervade their own bodies, whereas if they were of medium size they would be divisible into parts and thus could not be eternal, at least according to the axioms of Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika metaphysics. But if the numerous eternal j\u012bva souls are each infinitely large, how could they be covered by any power of bondage, whether belonging to avidy\u0101 or to the Supreme Lord Himself? According to this theory, there can be no illusion for the soul, no limitations from which to be liberated. The infinite souls must eternally remain as they are, without change. This would mean that the souls would all be equal to God, since He would have no scope for controlling these all-pervading, unchanging rivals. The Vedic \u015bruti-mantras, which affirm unequivocally the mastery of the Lord over the individual souls, cannot be validly contradicted. A true philosopher must accept the statements of \u015bruti as reliable authority on all matters they touch. Certainly in numerous places the Vedic literatures contrast the Supreme Lord\u2019s perpetual, unchanging oneness with the ever-changing embodiments of living beings caught up in the cycle of birth and death. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cIn my heart I take shelter of Him who is glorified as the inner controller of all the worlds, and whom the Vedas ascertain in truth through logical reasoning. He is N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, the omniscient and omnipotent Lord of the goddess of fortune.\u201d"

        "translation": "Neither material nature nor the soul who tries to enjoy her are ever born, yet living bodies come into being when these two combine, just as bubbles form where water meets the air. And just as rivers merge into the ocean or the nectar from many different flowers blends into honey, so all these conditioned beings eventually merge back into You, the Supreme, along with their various names and qualities.",
        "purport": " Without proper spiritual guidance, one may misunderstand the Vedas\u2019 description of the living entities emanating from the Lord to mean that they have come into being in this process and will eventually pass again into nonexistence. But if the living entities were to thus have only temporary existence, then when one of them would die his remaining karma would simply vanish without being used up, and when a soul would be born he would appear with unaccountable karma he had done nothing to earn. Furthermore, a living being\u2019s liberation would amount to the total eradication of his identity and being. The truth is, however, that the soul\u2019s essence is one with Brahman\u2019s, just as the small portion of space contained within the walls of a clay pot is one in essence with the all-expanding sky. And like the making and breaking of a pot, the \u201cbirth\u201d of an individual soul consists of his first becoming covered by a material body, and his \u201cdeath,\u201d or liberation, consists of the destruction of his gross and subtle bodies once and for all. Certainly such \u201cbirth\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d take place only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. The combination of material nature and her controller that produces the numerous conditioned beings in material creation is likened here to the combination of water and air that produces countless bubbles of foam on the surface of the sea. Just as the efficient cause, air, impels the ingredient cause, water, to form itself into bubbles, so by His glance the Supreme Puru\u1e63a inspires prak\u1e5bti to transform herself into the array of material elements and the innumerable material forms manifest from those elements. Prak\u1e5bti thus serves as the up\u0101d\u0101na-k\u0101ra\u1e47a, or ingredient cause, of creation. In the ultimate issue, however, since she is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord, it is the Lord alone who is the ingredient cause as well as the efficient cause. This is as stated in the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.2.1), tasm\u0101d v\u0101 etasm\u0101d \u0101tmana \u0101k\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sambh\u016bta\u1e25: \u201cFrom this Supreme Soul the ether evolved,\u201d and so\u00a0\u2019k\u0101mayata bahu sy\u0101\u1e41 praj\u0101yeya: \u201cHe desired, \u2018Let Me become many by expanding into progeny.\u2019\u201d The individual j\u012bva souls are not created when \u201cborn\u201d from the Supreme Lord and prak\u1e5bti, nor are they destroyed when they \u201cmerge\u201d back into the Lord, rejoining Him in the pleasure pastimes of His eternal kingdom. And in the same way as the infinitesimal j\u012bvas can appear to undergo birth and death without any factual change, the Supreme Lord can send forth and withdraw His emanations without Himself undergoing any transformation. Thus the B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (4.5.14) affirms, avin\u0101\u015bi v\u0101re\u00a0\u2019yam \u0101tm\u0101: \u201cThis \u0101tm\u0101 is indeed indestructible\u201d \u2014 a statement that can be applied to both the Supreme Soul and the subordinate j\u012bva soul. As explained by \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the dissolution of the living being\u2019s material condition occurs in two ways, partial and complete. Partial dissolution occurs when the soul experiences dreamless sleep, when he leaves his body and when all souls reenter the body of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u at the time of universal annihilation. These different types of dissolution are like the mixing of nectar brought by bees from different kinds of flowers. The different flavors of nectar represent the dormant individual karmic reactions of each living entity, which still exist but cannot easily be distinguished from one another. In contrast, the ultimate dissolution of the soul\u2019s material condition is his liberation from sa\u1e41s\u0101ra, which is like the flowing of rivers into the ocean. As the waters from different rivers merge together after entering the ocean and become indistinguishable from one another, so the false material designations of the j\u012bvas are given up at the time of liberation and all the liberated j\u012bvas once again become equally situated as servants of the Supreme Lord. The Upani\u1e63ads describe these dissolutions as follows: yath\u0101 saumya madhu madhu-k\u1e5bto nisti\u1e63\u1e6dhanti n\u0101n\u0101tyay\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 v\u1e5bk\u1e63\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 ras\u0101n samavah\u0101ram ekat\u0101\u1e41 sa\u1e45gayanti; te yath\u0101 tatra na viveka\u1e41 labhante amu\u1e63y\u0101ha\u1e41 v\u1e5bk\u1e63asya raso\u00a0\u2019smy amu\u1e63y\u0101ham raso\u00a0\u2019sm\u012bty evam eva khalu saumyem\u0101\u1e25 sarv\u0101\u1e25 praj\u0101\u1e25 sati sampadya na vidu\u1e25 sati sampady\u0101mahe: \u201cMy dear boy this [partial dissolution] resembles what happens when honeybees collect honey by extracting the nectar from the flowers of various kinds of trees and merge it all into a single mixture. Just as the mixed nectars cannot distinguish, \u2018I am the juice of such-and-such a flower,\u2019 or \u2018I am the juice of another flower,\u2019 so, dear boy, when all these living entities merge together they cannot consciously think, \u2018Now we have merged together.\u2019\u201d (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 6.9.1-2) \u201cAs rivers flow to their dissolution in the sea, giving up their names and forms at their destination, so the wise man who becomes free from material names and forms attains to the Supreme Absolute, the wonderful Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 3.2.8) \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cThe Supreme Lord is self-effulgently omniscient. By His great mercy, this universe, which is subject to repeated creation and destruction, remains present within Him after merging back into Him along with the living entities at the time of cosmic dissolution. This total withdrawal of the universal manifestation occurs suddenly, like the flowing of a river into the ocean. Within the core of my heart I meditate upon that master of the three worlds, Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha.\u201d"

        "purport": " The Vedas reveal their most cherished secret \u2014 devotional service to the Personality of Godhead \u2014 only to those who are tired of material illusion, which is based on a false sense of independence from the Lord. The V\u0101jasaney\u012b-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (32.11) of the White Yajur Veda contains the following mantra: \u201cAfter passing beyond all the species of life, all the planetary systems and all the limits of space in all directions, one approaches the original Soul of immortality. Then one receives the opportunity to enter permanently into His domain and worship Him with personal service.\u201d The proponents of various contending materialistic philosophies may consider themselves very wise, but they are in fact all deluded by the Supreme Lord\u2019s M\u0101y\u0101. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas recognize this pattern of general delusion and submit themselves to the Supreme Lord in the devotional moods of servitude, friendship and so on. Instead of the heat and strife of philosophical quarrel, the pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas experience only delight at every moment, because the object of their love is He who brings an end to material entanglement. And the devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u enjoy constant pleasure not only in this life but in future lives. In whatever births they take, they enjoy loving reciprocations with the Lord. Thus the sincere Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava prays: \u201cWherever I may wander, O master, among thousands of species of life, in each situation may I have firmly fixed devotion to You, O Acyuta.\u201d (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a) Some philosophers will question how the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas can overcome their material entrapment without thorough analytic knowledge of the entities tvam (\u201cyou,\u201d the j\u012bva) and tat (\u201cthat,\u201d the Supreme), and without developing a sufficient hatred of material life. The personified Vedas here answer that there is no chance of material illusion continuing to act on devotees of the Lord because even in the earliest stages of devotional service all fear and attachment are removed by the Lord\u2019s grace. Time is the root cause of all fear in this world. Indeed, with its three divisions of past, present and future it creates terror at the prospect of impending disease, death and hellish suffering \u2014 but only for those who have failed to obtain shelter at the feet of the Supreme Lord. As the Lord Himself says in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a (La\u1e45k\u0101-kha\u1e47\u1e0da 18.33): \u201cTo whomever even once surrenders to Me, pleading \u2018I am Yours,\u2019 I give eternal fearlessness. This is my solemn vow.\u201d Furthermore, in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14) the Lord says: \u201cThis divine energy of Mine consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.\u201d Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas do not like to waste their time in prolonged and fruitless wrangling over dry philosophic subjects. They would rather worship the Personality of Godhead than quarrel with philosophical adversaries. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas\u2019 understanding concurs with the essential message of revealed scripture. These devotees\u2019 conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth as the infinite ocean of personality and loving pastimes in His worshipable forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, R\u0101ma and other divine manifestations, and their conception of themselves as His eternal servants, amount to the perfect conclusion of Ved\u0101nta philosophy in terms of the entities tat and tvam. The Personality of Godhead and His emanations, such as the j\u012bva souls, are simultaneously different and nondifferent, just like the sun and its expanding rays. There are more j\u012bvas than anyone can count, and each of them is eternally alive with consciousness, as the \u015brutis confirm: nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m. (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 5.13 and \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.13) When they are sent forth from the body of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u at the beginning of material creation, the j\u012bvas are all equal in the sense that they are all atomic particles of the Lord\u2019s marginal energy. But according to their differing conditions, they divide into four groups: Some are covered by ignorance, which obscures their vision like a cloud. Others become liberated from ignorance through a combination of knowledge and devotion. A third group of souls become endowed with pure devotion, with a slight mixture of desire for speculative knowledge and fruitive activity. Those souls attain purified bodies composed of perfect knowledge and bliss with which they can engage in the Lord\u2019s service. Finally, there are those who are devoid of any connection with ignorance; these are the Lord\u2019s eternal associates. The marginal position of the j\u012bva soul is described in the N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra: \u201cThe ta\u1e6da-stha potency should be understood as emanating from the Lord\u2019s sa\u1e41vit [knowledge] energy. This emanation, called the j\u012bva, becomes conditioned by the qualities of material nature.\u201d Because the minute j\u012bva lives within the margin between the Lord\u2019s external, illusory potency, M\u0101y\u0101, and His internal, spiritual potency, cit, the j\u012bva is called ta\u1e6da-stha, \u201cmarginal.\u201d When he earns liberation by cultivating devotion to the Lord, however, he comes completely under the shelter of the Lord\u2019s internal potency, and at that time he is no longer tainted by the modes of material nature. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d The object of the soul\u2019s worship is realized in three aspects: Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n. Impersonal Brahman is like the radiant effulgence of the sun; the Supersoul, or Param\u0101tm\u0101, is like the sun globe; and the Personality of Godhead, Bhagav\u0101n, is like the presiding deity within the sun, complemented by his elaborate entourage and paraphernalia. Or, to cite another analogy, travelers approaching a city from a distance cannot at first distinguish its features but rather see something vaguely shining ahead of them. As they come closer, they may discern a few of the taller buildings. Then, when they are sufficiently close, they will see the city as it is \u2014 a bustling metropolis with many citizens, residences, public buildings, highways and parks. In the same way, persons inclined to impersonal meditation may at best gain some realization of the Supreme Lord\u2019s effulgence (Brahman), those who approach closer can learn to see Him as the Lord in the heart (Param\u0101tm\u0101), and those who come very close can know Him in His full personality (Bhagav\u0101n). In summary, \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cO \u015ar\u012b N\u1e5bhari, please deliver those human beings who have suffered all kinds of torments and been ripped apart by the sharp edge of sa\u1e41s\u0101ra\u2019s wheel but who have now somehow found You and are surrendering themselves unto You.\u201d"

        "purport": " To become qualified to attain love of Godhead, the mature fruit of liberation, one must first subdue the rebellious material mind. Though difficult, this can be achieved when a person replaces his addictions to sense gratification with a taste for the higher pleasures of spiritual life. But only by the favor of the representative of Godhead, the spiritual master, can one gain this higher taste. The spiritual master opens the eyes of the disciple to the wonders of the transcendental realm, as indicated in the G\u0101yatr\u012b prayers by the seed mantra of divine knowledge, ai\u1e41. The Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (1.2.12) states: \u201cTo understand these things properly, one must humbly approach, with firewood in hand, a spiritual master who is learned in the Vedas and firmly devoted to the Absolute Truth.\u201d And the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (2.9) declares: \u201cThis realization, my dear boy, cannot be acquired by logic. It must be spoken by an exceptionally qualified spiritual master to a knowledgeable disciple.\u201d Non-Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas often disregard the importance of surrendering to a spiritual master who stands in an authorized line of disciplic succession. Relying instead on their own abilities, proud yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs exhibit their apparent success to impress the world, but their glory is but temporary: \u201cThe minds of nondevotees who engage in such practices as pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma are not fully cleansed of material desires. Thus, O King, material desires are again seen to arise in their minds.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.51.60) On the other hand a humble, steadfast devotee of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas is assured of easy victory over the stubborn mind. He need not concern himself with performing the eightfold system of yoga or taking other such measures to keep his mind steady. Sarva\u1e41 caitad gurau bhakty\u0101 puru\u1e63o hy a\u00f1jas\u0101 jayet: \u201cA person can easily obtain all these goals simply by being devoted to his spiritual master.\u201d Otherwise, a nondevotee may conquer his senses and vital air and still fail to tame his mind, which will continue to run wild like an unbroken horse. He will suffer unending anxiety over the troublesome execution of various spiritual practices, and in the end he will remain just as lost in the vast material ocean as he ever was. The analogy given here is very appropriate: A group of merchants who hastily enter upon a sea voyage with expectations of great profit, but who fail to hire a competent helmsman for their boat, will simply experience great difficulty. The Bh\u0101gavatam declares the importance of the bona fide spiritual master in many places such as this verse from the Eleventh Canto (20.17): \u201cThe human body, which can award all benefit in life is automatically obtained by the laws of nature, although it is a very rare achievement. This human body can be compared to a perfectly constructed boat having the spiritual master as the captain and the instructions of the Personality of Godhead as favorable winds impelling it on its course. Considering all these advantages, a human being who does not utilize his human life to cross the ocean of material existence must be considered the killer of his own soul.\u201d Therefore the first business of one who takes human life seriously is to find out a spiritual master who can guide him in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cO transcendentally blissful guru, when my mind finally achieves a place at your lotus feet, all the tiresome labor of my spiritual practices will be finished, and by your mercy I will experience the greatest happiness.\u201d"

        "purport": " Devotional service to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is considered pure when one\u2019s sole desire is to please the Lord. Situated in that perfect consciousness, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava has no further interest in wordly gains and is thus excused from any obligation to perform ritual sacrifices and follow austere practices of yoga. As the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (1.2.12) states: \u201cWhen a br\u0101hma\u1e47a recognizes that elevation to the heavenly planets is merely another accumulation of karma, he becomes renounced and is no longer corrupted by his actions.\u201d The B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka (4.4.9) and Ka\u1e6dha (6.14) Upani\u1e63ads confirm: \u201cWhen a person completely gives up all the sinful desires he is harboring in his heart, he exchanges mortality for eternal spiritual life and attains real pleasure in the Absolute Truth.\u201d And the Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad (P\u016brva 15) concludes, bhaktir asya bhajana\u1e41 tad ih\u0101mutrop\u0101dhi-nair\u0101syen\u0101mu\u1e63min mana\u1e25-kalpanam etad eva nai\u1e63karmyam. \u201cDevotional service is the process of worshiping the Supreme Lord. It consists of fixing one\u2019s mind upon Him by becoming disinterested in all material designations, both in this life and the next. This indeed, is true renunciation.\u201d The items the \u015brutis mention here are all measures of worldly success: svajan\u0101\u1e25, servants; \u0101tm\u0101, a beautiful body; sut\u0101\u1e25, children to be proud of; d\u0101r\u0101\u1e25, an attractive and competent spouse; dhanam, financial assets; dh\u0101ma, a prestigious residence; dhar\u0101, holdings of land; asava\u1e25, health and strength; and rath\u0101\u1e25, cars and other vehicles that display one\u2019s status. But one who has begun to experience the ecstasy of devotional service loses all attraction for these things, since he finds real satisfaction in the Supreme Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, who enjoys by sharing His own pleasures with His servitors. We are each free to choose the course of our life: we can either dedicate our body, mind, words, talents and wealth to the glory of God, or else we can ignore Him and struggle instead for our personal happiness. The second path leads to a life of slavery to sex and ambition, in which the soul never feels real satisfaction but instead suffers continually. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are distressed to see materialists suffering in this way, and so they always strive to enlighten them. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cFor those who worship You, You become their very Self, their spiritual treasure of topmost bliss.

To develop his capacity for discriminating the important from the unimportant, such a person often wanders from one holy site to another, taking advantage of the association of great souls who frequent or reside in these places. If, in the course of his travels, the aspiring sage can begin to realize the Supreme Lord\u2019s lotus feet in the core of his heart, he will be released from the illusion of false ego and from the painful bondage of lust, envy and greed.

Sometimes, indeed, the apparent nondifference of a cause and its effect fails to prove true, and at other times the product of something real is illusory. Furthermore, this world cannot be permanently real, for it partakes of the natures of not only the absolute reality but also the illusion disguising that reality. Actually, the visible forms of this world are just an imaginary arrangement resorted to by a succession of ignorant persons in order to facilitate their material affairs.

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the Upani\u1e63ads teach that this created world is real but temporary. This is the understanding that devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u adhere to. But there are also materialistic philosophers, like the proponents of Jaimini \u1e5a\u1e63i\u2019s Karma m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101, who claim that this world is the only reality and exists eternally. For Jaimini, the cycle of karmic action and reaction is perpetual, with no possibility of liberation into a different, transcendental realm. This viewpoint, however, is shown to be fallacious by a careful examination of the Upani\u1e63adic mantras, which contain many descriptions of a higher, spiritual existence. For example, sad eva saumyedam agra \u0101s\u012bd ekam ev\u0101dvit\u012byam: \u201cMy dear boy, the Absolute Truth alone existed prior to this creation, one without a second.\u201d (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 6.2.1) Also, vij\u00f1\u0101nam \u0101nanda\u1e41 brahma: \u201cThe supreme reality is divine knowledge and bliss.\u201d (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 3.9.34) In this prayer of the personified Vedas, the materialists\u2019 argument is summed up in the words sata idam utthita\u1e41 sat: \u201cThe visible world is permanently real because it is generated from the permanent reality.\u201d In general, this argument goes, that which is produced from a certain thing is composed of that thing. For example, earrings and other ornaments made from gold share gold\u2019s substance. Thus, the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 logicians conclude, since the world as we know it is a manifestation of an eternal reality, it is also eternally real. But the Sanskrit ablative expression sata\u1e25, \u201cfrom the eternal reality,\u201d implies a definite separation of cause and effect. Therefore, what is created from sat, the permanent reality, must be significantly different from it \u2014 in other words, temporary. In this way the argument of the materialists is flawed because it proves just the opposite of what it is intended to prove (tarka-hatam), namely that the world as we know it is all that exists, that it is eternal, and that there is no separate, transcendental reality. In defense, the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas may claim that they are not trying to prove nondifference per se, but rather trying to disprove the possibility of difference, or in other words, the possibility of any reality separate from the known world. This attempt to support the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 argument is easily refuted by the phrase vyabhicarati kva ca: that is to say, there are counterexamples that deviate from the general rule. Sometimes, indeed, the source is very different from what it produces, as in the case of a man and his young son, or of a hammer and the destruction of a clay pot. But, the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas reply, the creation of the universe is not the same kind of causation as your counterexamples: the father and the hammer are only efficient causes, whereas the sat is also this universe\u2019s ingredient cause. This reply is anticipated by the words kva ca m\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101 (\u201cand sometimes the effect is illusory\u201d). In the case of the false perception of a snake where there is a rope on the ground, the rope is the snake-illusion\u2019s ingredient cause, differing in many respects from the imagined snake, most obviously in its being real. The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas once more rejoin: But the ingredient cause of the illusory snake is not just the rope by itself: it is the rope plus the observer\u2019s ignorance (avidy\u0101). Since avidy\u0101 is not a substance, the snake it produces is called an illusion. Yet the same is true, the personified Vedas reply, in the case of the universe\u2019s creation from sat in conjunction with ignorance (tathobhaya-yuk); here the unreal element of illusion, M\u0101y\u0101, is the living beings\u2019 misconception that their own bodies and other changing material forms are permanent. But, rejoin the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas, our experience of this world is valid because the things we experience are useful for practical activity. If our experience were not valid, we could never be sure that our perceptions corresponded to the facts. We would be like a man who, despite exhaustive examination, would still have to suspect that a rope might be a snake. No, the \u015brutis here answer, the temporary configurations of matter are nonetheless an illusory imitation of the eternal spiritual reality, cleverly concocted to fulfill the conditioned living entities\u2019 desire for material activity (vyavah\u1e5btaye vikalpa i\u1e63ita\u1e25). The illusion of this world\u2019s permanence is sustained by a succession of blind men who learn the materialistic idea from their predecessors and pass on this illusion to their descendants. Anyone can see that an illusion often continues by the momentum of lingering mental impressions, even when its basis is no longer present. Thus throughout history blind philosophers have misled other blind men by convincing them of the absurd idea that they can reach perfection by engaging in mundane rituals. Foolish people may be willing to exchange counterfeit coins among one another, but a wise man knows that such money is useless for the practical business of buying food, medicine and other necessities. And if given in charity, counterfeit money will earn no pious credit. But, say the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas, how can the sincere performer of Vedic rituals be a deluded fool, since the Sa\u1e41hit\u0101s and Br\u0101hma\u1e47as of the Vedic scriptures establish that the fruits of karma are eternal? For example, ak\u1e63ayya\u1e41 ha vai c\u0101turm\u0101sya-y\u0101jina\u1e25 su-k\u1e5bta\u1e41 bhavati: \u201cFor one who observes the C\u0101turm\u0101sya vows there arises inexhaustible good karma,\u201d and ap\u0101ma somam am\u1e5bta babh\u016bma: \u201cWe have drunk the soma and become immortal.\u201d (\u1e5ag Veda 8.43.3) The \u015brutis reply by pointing out that the Personality of Godhead\u2019s learned words, comprising the Vedas, bewilder those whose weak intelligence has been crushed by the weight of too much faith in karma. The specific word used here is uru-v\u1e5bttibhi\u1e25, which indicates that the Vedic mantras, with their confusing variety of meanings in the semantic modes of gau\u1e47a, lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 and so on, protect their sublime mysteries from all but those who have faith in Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Vedas do not truly mean to say in their injunctions that the fruits of karma are eternal, but only indirectly describe in metaphors the praiseworthiness of regulated sacrifices. The Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad states in no uncertain terms that the results of ritual karma are impermanent: tad yatheha karma-cito loka\u1e25 k\u1e63\u012byate evam ev\u0101mutra pu\u1e47ya-cito loka\u1e25 k\u1e63\u012byate. \u201cJust as whatever benefit one works hard to attain in this world is eventually depleted, so whatever life one earns for oneself in the next world by his piety will also eventually end.\u201d (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 8.1.16) According to the testimony of numerous \u015bruti-mantras, the entire material universe is but a temporary emanation of the Supreme Truth; the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad, for one, says: \u201cAs a web is expanded and withdrawn by a spider, as plants grow from the earth, and as hair grows from a living person\u2019s head and body, so this universe is generated from the inexhaustible Supreme.\u201d (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.1.7) \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cAlthough this world has arisen from You, who are the very substance of reality, it is not eternally real. The illusory snake appearing from a rope is not permanent reality, nor are the transformations produced from gold. The Vedas never say that they are. The actual, transcendental, nondual reality is Your supremely blissful personal kingdom. To that beautiful abode I offer my obeisances. O Lord Hari, to whom Goddess Indir\u0101 always bows down, I also bow to You. Therefore please never release me.\u201d"

We liken this universe to the transformation of various material substances into diverse forms. Certainly those who believe that this figment of the imagination is substantially real are less intelligent.",
        "purport": " Having thus defeated all attempts of the ritualists to prove the substantial reality of material creation, the personified Vedas now present positive evidence to the contrary \u2014 that this world is unreal in that it is temporary. Before the creation of the universe and after its dissolution, only the spiritual reality of the Supreme Lord, along with His abode and entourage, continue to exist. The \u015brutis confirm this: \u0100tm\u0101 va idam eka ev\u0101gra \u0101s\u012bt. \u201cPrior to the creation of this universe, only the Self existed.\u201d (Aitareya Upani\u1e63ad 1.1) N\u0101sad \u0101s\u012bn no sad \u0101s\u012bt tad\u0101n\u012bm: \u201cAt that time neither the subtle nor the gross aspects of matter were present.\u201d (\u1e5ag Veda 10.129.1) One can understand the relativity of creation by an analogy. When basic materials like clay and metal are processed and shaped into various products, the created objects exist separately from the clay and metal only in name and form. The basic substance remains unchanged. Similarly, when the energies of the Supreme Lord are transformed into the known things of this world, these things exist separately from Him only in name and form. In the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad (6.1.4-6), the sage Ud\u0101laka explains a similar analogy to his son: yath\u0101 saumyaikena m\u1e5btpi\u1e47\u1e0dena sarva\u1e41 m\u1e5bn-maya\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101tam sy\u0101d v\u0101c\u0101rambha\u1e47a\u1e41 vik\u0101ro n\u0101madheya\u1e41 m\u1e5bttikety eva satyam. \u201cFor example, my dear boy, by understanding a single lump of clay one can understand everything made from clay. The existence of transformed products is only a creation of language, a matter of assigning designations: the clay alone is real.\u201d In conclusion, there is no convincing evidence that the things of this world are eternal or substantial, while there is overwhelming evidence that they are temporary and conditioned by false designations. Therefore only the ignorant can take the imaginary permutations of matter to be real. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cTransformations of gold such as crowns, earrings, bangles and ankle bells are not ultimately separate from gold itself. Similarly, the material elements \u2014 headed by the mahat, false ego and ether \u2014 are not ultimately separate from Lord Narahari.\u201d"

Subsequently, he loses all his spiritual qualities and must undergo repeated deaths. You, however, avoid the material energy in the same way that a snake abandons its old skin. Glorious in Your possession of eight mystic perfections, You enjoy unlimited opulences.",
        "purport": " Although the j\u012bva is pure spirit, qualitatively equal with the Supreme Lord, he is prone to being degraded by embracing the ignorance of material illusion. When he becomes entranced by the allurements of M\u0101y\u0101, he accepts bodies and senses that are designed to let him indulge in forgetfulness. Produced from the raw material of M\u0101y\u0101\u2019s three modes \u2014 goodness, passion and nescience \u2014 these bodies envelop the spirit soul in varieties of unhappiness, culminating in death and rebirth. The Supreme Soul and the individual soul share the same spiritual nature, but the Supreme Soul cannot be entrapped by ignorance like His infinitesimal companion. Smoke may engulf the glow of a small molten sphere of copper, covering its light in darkness, but the vast globe of the sun will never suffer the same kind of eclipse. M\u0101y\u0101, after all, is the Personality of Godhead\u2019s faithful maidservant, the outward expansion of His internal, Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 potency. \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra thus states, in a conversation between \u015aruti and Vidy\u0101: \u201cThe covering potency derived from her is Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, the regulator of everything material. The entire universe becomes bewildered by her, and thus every living being falsely identifies with his material body.\u201d Just as a snake casts aside his old skin, knowing that it is not part of his essential identity, so the Supreme Lord always avoids His external, material energy. There is no insufficiency or limit to any of His eightfold mystic opulences, consisting of a\u1e47im\u0101 (the power to become infinitesimal), mahim\u0101 (the ability to become infinitely large) and so on. Therefore, the shadow of material darkness has no scope for entering the domain of His unequaled, resplendent glories. For the sake of those whose realization of spiritual life is only gradually awakening, the Upani\u1e63ads sometimes speak in general terms of \u0101tm\u0101 or Brahman, not openly distinguishing the difference between the superior and inferior souls, the Param\u0101tm\u0101 and j\u012bv\u0101tma. But often enough they describe this duality in unequivocal terms: \u201cTwo companion birds sit together in the shelter of the same pippala tree. One of them is relishing the taste of the tree\u2019s berries, while the other refrains from eating and instead watches over His friend.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 4.6) In this analogy the two birds are the soul and the Supersoul, the tree is the body, and the taste of the berries are the varieties of sense pleasure. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cThe glance You cast upon Your consort comprises time, the material propensities of the living entities, and so on. This glance dances upon her face, thus awakening the multitude of created entities, who take birth in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. O Lord N\u1e5bhari, Your M\u0101y\u0101 has put her foot on my head and is pressing down extremely hard, causing me great distress. Now I have come to You for shelter. Please make her desist.\u201d"

        "translation": "Members of the renounced order who fail to uproot the last traces of material desire in their hearts remain impure, and thus You do not allow them to understand You. Although You are present within their hearts, for them You are like a jewel worn around the neck of a man who has totally forgotten it is there. O Lord, those who practice yoga only for sense gratification must suffer punishment both in this life and the next: from death, who will not release them, and from You, whose kingdom they cannot reach.",
        "purport": " A mere show of renunciation is not sufficient to gain a person entrance into the kingdom of God. One must undergo a thorough change of heart, symptomized by a complete lack of interest in the self-destructive habits of sense gratification, both gross and subtle. Not only must the true sage refrain from even thinking of illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling, but he must also give up his desires for reputation and position. All together these demands add up to a formidable challenge but the fruits of true renunciation in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are well worth a lifetime of endeavor. The Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (3.2.2) confirms the statements of this verse: k\u0101m\u0101n ya\u1e25 k\u0101mayate manyam\u0101na\u1e25 sa karmabhir j\u0101yate tatra tatra. \u201cEven a thoughtful renunciant, if he maintains any worldly desires will be forced by his karmic reactions to take birth again and again in various circumstances.\u201d Philosophers and yog\u012bs work hard to become free from birth and death, but because they are unwilling to surrender their proud independence, their meditations are devoid of devotion to the Supreme Lord, and thus they fall short of the perfection of renunciation \u2014 pure love of God. This pure love is the only goal of a sincere Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, and therefore he must vigilantly resist the natural temptations of profit, adoration and distinction, and also the impulse to merge into an all consuming impersonal oblivion. As \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b states in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.1.11): \u201cWhen first-class devotional service develops, one must be devoid of all material desires, knowledge obtained by monistic philosophy, and fruitive action. The devotee must constantly serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desires. For those who undergo rigorous yoga discipline only to please their senses, prolonged suffering is inevitable. Hunger, disease, the degeneration of old age, injury from accident, violence from others \u2014 these are a few of the limitless varieties of suffering one can experience to varying degrees in this world. And ultimately, death awaits, followed by painful punishment for sinful activities. Especially those who have freely indulged in sensual enjoyments at the cost of others\u2019 lives can expect punishment so severe it is unimaginable. But the greatest pain of material existence is not misfortune in this life or being sent to hell after death: it is the emptiness of having forgotten one\u2019s eternal relationship with the Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cThe hypocrite who cheats himself by a pretense of renunciation thinks only of sense enjoyment and thus suffers constantly. Bewildered day and night, he is overwhelmed by the exhausting endeavors he contrives for himself. This fool disobeys Your laws and is corrupted by greed for respect from other fools. O protector of the fallen, O bestower of mercy, O supremely blissful master, please save that person, myself.\u201d"

Every day he fills his ears with Your glories, which are recited in each age by the unbroken succession of Manu\u2019s descendants, and thus You become his ultimate salvation.",
        "purport": " Text 39 clearly states that impersonalistic renunciants will continue to suffer birth after birth. One may ask if this suffering is justified, since a renunciant\u2019s status should exempt him from suffering, whether or not he has a devotional attitude. As the \u015bruti-mantra states, e\u1e63a nityo mahim\u0101 br\u0101hma\u1e47asya na karma\u1e47\u0101 vardhate no kan\u012by\u0101n: \u201cThe perpetual glory of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is never increased or diminished as a result of any of his activities.\u201d (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 4.4.28) To counter the objection thus raised, the personified Vedas offer this prayer. Impersonalistic j\u00f1an\u012bs and yog\u012bs do not qualify for full relief from the reactions of karma \u2014 a privilege reserved only for those who are tvad-avagam\u012b, pure devotees constantly engaged in hearing and chanting topics concerning the Personality of Godhead. The devotees hold firm to the Supreme Lord\u2019s lotus feet by their unrelenting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and so they need not strictly adhere to the ritual commands and prohibitions of the Vedas. They can fearlessly ignore the apparent good and bad reactions of the work they do only for the Supreme Lord\u2019s pleasure, and they can equally ignore whatever others may say about them, whether praise or condemnation. A humble Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava absorbed in the pleasure of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, glorification of the Lord, pays little heed to praise of himself, which he assumes mistaken, and happily accepts all criticism, which he deems appropriate. One receives the authorized chanting of the Supreme Lord\u2019s glories by faithfully hearing from \u201cthe sons of Manu,\u201d the disciplic succession of saintly Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas coming down through the ages. These sages emulate well the example of Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, the forefather of mankind: \u201cAlthough Sv\u0101yambhuva\u2019s life gradually came to an end, his long life, consisting of a manvantara era, was not spent in vain, since he always engaged in hearing, contemplating, writing down and chanting the pastimes of the Lord.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.22.35) Even if a neophyte devotee falls from the standards of proper behavior by the force of his past bad habits, the all-merciful Lord will not reject him. As Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states: \u201cFor those who live in Bhadrak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a [the district of Mathur\u0101], I am the object of all worship. Even if the residents of that place fail to properly cultivate the religious principles that one should observe in the holy land, they still become devoted to Me just by virtue of living there. Even if Kali [the present age of quarrel] has them in his grip, they still get credit for living in this place. My devotee who lives in Mathur\u0101 is just as dear to Me as you [Brahm\u0101] and your sons \u2014 Rudra and his followers \u2014 and Goddess \u015ar\u012b and My own self.\u201d (Gop\u0101la T\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad, Uttara 16) \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cO M\u0101dhava, please let Me understand You so that I will no longer experience the entanglement of material pleasure and pain. Or else, just as good, please give me a taste for hearing and chanting about You. In that way I will no longer be a slave to ritual injunctions.\u201d"

Although we can never fully describe the truth about You, we perfect our existence by declaring that You are the true topic of the Vedas.\u201d \u201cBut why do you seem dissatisfied?\u201d \u201cBecause in the Vedas \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva has described the transcendental existence of Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n only briefly. When he saw the need to elaborate on his description of the Supreme, he chose to concentrate on the subject of Brahman, the impersonal aspect of the Supreme known as tat (\u2018that\u2019) explaining Brahman by negating whatever is different from it. Just as in a field where a chest of jewels has been accidentally spilled the jewels can be recovered by removing unwanted stones, twigs and refuse, so within the visible realm of M\u0101y\u0101 and her creations the Absolute Truth can be found by a process of elimination. Since we Vedas cannot possibly enumerate every material category, individual entity, quality and motion in the universe from the beginning to the end of time and since the truth concerning Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n would still remain untouched even if we described all these things and then discarded them, by this means of investigation we never expect to reach a final definition of You. Only by Your mercy can we make some attempt to approach You, the supremely inaccessible Absolute Truth.\u201d There are many statements of \u015bruti that carry on the work of atan-nirasanam, the process of distinguishing the Supreme from everything inferior. The B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (3.8.8), for example, states, asth\u016blam ana\u1e47u ahrasvam ad\u012brgham alohitam asneham acch\u0101yam atamo\u00a0\u2019v\u0101yv an\u0101k\u0101\u015bam asa\u1e45gam arasam agandham acak\u1e63u\u1e63kam a\u015brotram agamano\u00a0\u2019tejaskam apr\u0101\u1e47am asukham am\u0101tram anantaram ab\u0101hyam. \u201cIt is neither big nor small, short nor long, hot nor cool, in shadow nor in darkness. Nor is it the wind or the ether. It is not in contact with anything, and it has no taste, smell, eyes, ears, motion, potency, life air, pleasure, measurement, inside or outside.\u201d The Kena Upani\u1e63ad (3) declares, anyad eva tad vidit\u0101d atho avidit\u0101d adhi: \u201cBrahman is distinct from what is known and also from what is yet to be known.\u201d And the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (2.14) says, anyatra dharm\u0101d anyatr\u0101dharm\u0101d anyatr\u0101sm\u0101t k\u1e5bt\u0101k\u1e5bt\u0101t: \u201cBrahman is outside the scope of religion and irreligion, pious and impious action.\u201d According to the rules of linguistics and logic, a negation cannot be unbounded: there must be some positive counterpart of which it is the negation. In the case of the Vedas\u2019 exhaustive atan-nirasanam, their denial that anything material is absolutely real, the counterpart is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b prays: \u201cThe gods of heaven do not know Your limit, O endless Lord, and even You do not know it. Because the transcendental words of the topmost \u015brutis become fruitful by revealing You, I offer You my obeisances. Thus I worship You as the Absolute Truth, saying \u2018All glories to You! All glories to You!\u2019\u201d"

        "translation": "He is the Lord who eternally watches over this universe, who exists before, during and after its manifestation. He is the master of both the unmanifest material energy and the spirit soul. After sending forth the creation He enters within it, accompanying each living entity. There He creates the material bodies and then remains as their regulator. By surrendering to Him one can escape the embrace of illusion, just as a dreaming person forgets his own body. One who wants liberation from fear should constantly meditate upon Him, Lord Hari, who is always on the platform of perfection and thus never subject to material birth.",
        "purport": " By glancing upon the dormant universe at the time of sending forth the j\u012bva souls into creation, the Supreme Lord provides all their necessities: For those living entities who are fruitive workers, He provides the intelligence and senses needed to achieve success in material work. For those who seek transcendental knowledge, He provides the intelligence by which they can merge into the spiritual effulgence of God, thus attaining liberation. And for the devotees He provides the understanding that leads them to His pure devotional service. To arrange for these varied facilities, the Lord impels material nature to begin the process of universal evolution. Thus the Lord is the nimitta-k\u0101ra\u1e47am, or effective cause, of creation. He is also the up\u0101d\u0101na-k\u0101ra\u1e47am, the ingredient cause, inasmuch as everything emanates from Him and He alone is constantly present before, during and after the manifestation of the created cosmos. Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a Himself states this in the Catu\u1e25-\u015blok\u012b Bh\u0101gavatam: \u201cIt is I, the Personality of Godhead, who was existing before the creation, when there was nothing but Myself. Nor was there the material nature, the cause of this creation. That which you see now is also I, the Personality of Godhead and after annihilation what remains will also be I, the Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.9.33) Primeval M\u0101y\u0101 and the j\u012bva soul may deserve the respective titles of up\u0101d\u0101na and nimitta causes of creation in a relative sense, but the Lord, after all, is the origin of both of them. Until he chooses to accept the mercy of the Personality of Godhead, the j\u012bva soul is anu\u015bay\u012b, helplessly bound up in the embrace of illusion. When he turns to the Lord\u2019s worship, he becomes anu\u015bay\u012b in a different sense: fallen like a rod to pay obeisances at the Lord\u2019s feet. By that surrender the soul easily casts illusion aside. Even though the liberated soul may still seem to be living in a material body, the connection he has with it is only an external appearance; he pays no more regard to it than a sleeping man pays to his body while busily engaged far, far away in his dream-world. One gives up ignorance by abandoning false identification with one\u2019s material body. Sometimes one can achieve this state only by a severe effort that takes many lifetimes, but in some cases the Lord may show special consideration for one He favors, regardless of how little credit that soul may have earned by regulated practice. In the words of \u015ar\u012b Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva, yam iha nir\u012bk\u1e63ya hat\u0101 gat\u0101\u1e25 svar\u016bpam: \u201cThose who simply saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra attained their original forms after being killed.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.9.39) That even demons like Agha, Baka and Ke\u015b\u012b were liberated by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without having performed any spiritual practices is an indication of His unique position as the original Personality of Godhead. Knowing this, we should put aside all fear and doubt and give ourselves fully to the process of devotional service. As his final words of commentary on this chapter, \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b writes: \u201cWith their effulgence, the crest jewels among all the \u015brutis offer \u0101rat\u012b to the lotus feet of Lord M\u0101dhava. I pay homage to Him, who bestows the material enjoyment honored by material workers, and who also grants the divine connection with Him prized by those who bow down to Him with reverence.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also takes this opportunity to offer this humble prayer: \u201cO devotees, this poor creature is standing at your doorway, waving his tail and barking. Please let him have a little pras\u0101dam so that he may become exceptional among dogs and get the best of masters as his owner.\u201d Here the \u0101c\u0101rya makes a pun on his own name: vi\u015b(i\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25), \u201cexceptional\u201d; \u015bva(iva), \u201clike a dog\u201d; n\u0101tha(ati), \u201chaving a master.\u201d Such is the perfection of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava humility."
