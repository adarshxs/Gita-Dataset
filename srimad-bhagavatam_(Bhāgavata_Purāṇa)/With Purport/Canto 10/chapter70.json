Of course, the soul is never created, but our material, conditioned existence is created by the interaction of the Lord\u2019s energies. One who is favored by the Lord\u2019s internal potency can understand the nature of the Absolute Truth; this understanding is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains that His energies are divided into inferior and superior, or material and spiritual, potencies. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 further explains that the material potency acts like a shadow, following the movements of the spiritual reality, which is the Lord Himself and His spiritual potency. When one is favored by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He reveals Himself to the surrendered soul, and thus the same creation that formerly covered the soul becomes an impetus for spiritual enlightenment."

The self-possessed Lord would then carefully worship His elders and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. To those well-attired br\u0101hma\u1e47as He would offer herds of tame and peaceful cows with gold-plated horns and pearl necklaces. These cows were also dressed in fine cloth, and the fronts of their hooves were plated with silver. Providers of abundant milk, they had each given birth only once and were accompanied by their calves. Daily the Lord gave many groups of 13,084 cows to the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as, together with linen, deerskins and sesame seeds.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b quotes several Vedic scriptures to show that in the context of Vedic ritual, a badva here refers to 13,084 cows. The words badva\u1e41 badva\u1e41 dine dine indicate that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would give the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as many such groups of cows on a daily basis. \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b further gives evidence that the usual practice for great saintly kings in previous ages was to give 107 such badva, or groups of 13,084 cows. Thus the total number of cows given in this sacrifice, known as Ma\u00f1c\u0101ra, is 14 lakhs, or 1,400,000. The words ala\u1e45k\u1e5btebhyo viprebhya\u1e25 indicate that in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s kingdom the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were given nice clothes and ornaments and were thus well attired. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da writes with striking and profound insight on these pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The reader is strongly urged to study this book, which contains an invaluable wealth of information and commentary on the pastimes described in the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Our humble attempt here can never equal the consummate purity and skill of our great master. Still, as a service offered at his lotus feet, we are simply presenting the original Sanskrit text of the Tenth Canto, word-for-word meanings, a clear translation and essential commentary, for the most part based on the statements of the great spiritual masters in our line."

The kings here imply that Jar\u0101sandha is especially harassing them because they are souls surrendered to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore they beg the Lord, \u201cO You who hold the cakra weapon high, please make the proper arrangement.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da expresses the kings\u2019 feelings as follows: \u201cMy dear Lord, You have already fought with Jar\u0101sandha eighteen times consecutively, out of which You have defeated him seventeen times by surpassing his extraordinary powerful position. But in Your eighteenth fight You exhibited Your human behavior, and thus it appeared that You were defeated. My dear Lord, we know very well that Jar\u0101sandha cannot defeat You at any time, because Your power, strength, resources and authority are all unlimited. No one can equal You or surpass You. The appearance of defeat by Jar\u0101sandha in the eighteenth engagement is nothing but an exhibition of human behavior. Unfortunately, foolish Jar\u0101sandha could not understand Your tricks, and he has since then become puffed up over his material power and prestige. Specifically, he has arrested us and imprisoned us, knowing fully that as Your devotees, we are subordinate to Your sovereignty.\u201d"
