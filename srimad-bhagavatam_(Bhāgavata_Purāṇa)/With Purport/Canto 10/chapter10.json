Taking advantage of this, they used to drink a kind of liquor called V\u0101ru\u1e47\u012b.

Apart from Lord \u015aiva, if one is a devotee of any other demigod, one receives some material advantages. Foolish people, therefore, become devotees of demigods. This has been pointed out and criticized by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20): k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante\u00a0\u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25. Those who are not devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a have a taste for women, wine and so forth, and therefore they have been described as h\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101na, bereft of sense. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement can very easily point out such foolish persons, for they have been indicated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.15), where Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cThose miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.\u201d Anyone who is not a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and does not surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must be considered nar\u0101dhama, the lowest of men, and du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b, one who always commits sinful activities. Thus there is no difficulty in finding out who is a third-class or fourth-class man, for one\u2019s position can be understood simply by this crucial test: is he or is he not a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? Why are devotees of the demigods greater in number than the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas? The answer is given herein. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are not interested in such fourth-class pleasures as wine and women, nor does K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a allow them such facilities."

Therefore human life is meant for subduing the modes of passion and ignorance and advancing in the mode of goodness. This is culture: one must subdue the modes of passion and ignorance. In the mode of passion, when one is falsely proud of wealth, one engages his wealth only for three things, namely wine, women and gambling. We can actually see, especially in this age, that those who have unnecessary riches simply try to enjoy these three things. In Western civilization, these three things are very prominent because of an unnecessary increase of wealth. N\u0101rada Muni considered all this in the case of Ma\u1e47igr\u012bva and Nalak\u016bvara because he found in them so much pride in the wealth of their father, Kuvera."

Sometimes they kill animals merely to enjoy an excursion.",
        "purport": " When the modes of passion and ignorance increase in human society, giving rise to unnecessary economic development, the result is that people become involved with wine, women and gambling. Then, being mad, they maintain big slaughterhouses or occasionally go on pleasure excursions to kill animals. Forgetting that however one may try to maintain the body, the body is subject to birth, death, old age and disease, such foolish rascals engage in sinful activities, one after another. Being du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012bs, they completely forget the existence of the supreme controller, who is sitting within the core of everyone\u2019s heart (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be\u00a0\u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati). That supreme controller is observing every bit of one\u2019s activity, and He rewards or punishes everyone by giving one a suitable body made by material nature (bhr\u0101mayan sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni yantr\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101ni m\u0101yay\u0101). In this way, sinful persons automatically receive punishment in different types of bodies. The root cause of this punishment is that when one unnecessarily accumulates wealth, one becomes more and more degraded, not knowing that his wealth will be finished with his next birth. Animal killing is prohibited. Every living being, of course, has to eat something (j\u012bvo j\u012bvasya j\u012bvanam). But one should be taught what kind of food one should take. Therefore the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad instructs, tena tyaktena bhu\u00f1j\u012bth\u0101\u1e25: one should eat whatever is allotted for human beings. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26): \u201cIf one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.\u201d A devotee, therefore, does not eat anything that would require slaughterhouses for poor animals. Rather, devotees take pras\u0101da of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (tena tyaktena bhu\u00f1j\u012bth\u0101\u1e25). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends that one give Him patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toyam \u2014 a leaf, a flower, fruit or water. Animal food is never recommended for human beings; instead, a human being is recommended to take pras\u0101da, remnants of food left by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Yaj\u00f1a-\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u015bina\u1e25 santo mucyante sarva-kilbi\u1e63ai\u1e25 (Bg. 3.13). If one practices eating pras\u0101da, even if there is some little sinful activity involved, one becomes free from the results of sinful acts."

Those who are more civilized burn the dead body, and thus it becomes ashes (bhasma-sa\u1e41j\u00f1itam). Yet although the body will be turned into worms, stool or ashes, foolish persons, just to maintain it, commit many sinful activities. This is certainly regrettable. The human form of body is actually meant for j\u012bvasya tattva jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101, enlightenment in knowledge of spiritual values.

The only business of a saintly person or sanny\u0101s\u012b, a person in the renounced order, is to preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. S\u0101dhus, saintly persons, want to preach to both the poor and the rich, but the poor take more advantage of the s\u0101dhus\u2019 preaching than the rich do. A poor man receives s\u0101dhus very quickly, offers them obeisances, and tries to take advantage of their presence, whereas a rich man keeps a big greyhound dog at his door so that no one can enter his house. He posts a sign saying \u201cBeware of Dog\u201d and avoids the association of saintly persons, whereas a poor man keeps his door open for them and thus benefits by their association more than a rich man does. Because N\u0101rada Muni, in his previous life, was the poverty-stricken son of a maidservant, he got the association of saintly persons and later became the exalted N\u0101rada Muni. This was his actual experience. Therefore, he is now comparing the position of a poor man with that of a rich man. If one gets the advantage of association with saintly persons, by their instructions one becomes more and more purified of material desires. Material life means that one forgets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that one increases in one\u2019s desires for sense gratification.

Why should people neglect the association of such exalted spiritual personalities and try to associate with materialists, taking shelter of nondevotees, most of whom are proud and rich?",
        "purport": " A s\u0101dhu is one who is engaged in devotional service to the Lord without deviation (bhajate m\u0101m ananya-bh\u0101k). \u201cThe symptoms of a s\u0101dhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities. He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.25.21) A s\u0101dhu is suh\u1e5bda\u1e25 sarva-dehin\u0101m, the friend of everyone. Why then should the rich, instead of associating with s\u0101dhus, waste their valuable time in association with other rich men who are averse to spiritual life? Both the poor man and the rich man can take advantage of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, and here it is advised that everyone do so. There is no profit in avoiding the association of the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has said: If we give up the association of s\u0101dhus, saintly persons engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and associate with persons seeking sense gratification and accumulating wealth for this purpose, our life is spoiled. The word asat refers to an avai\u1e63\u1e47ava, one who is not a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and sat refers to a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotee. One should always seek the association of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and not spoil one\u2019s life by mixing with avai\u1e63\u1e47avas. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.15), the distinction between Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and avai\u1e63\u1e47ava is enunciated: Anyone who is not surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a most sinful person (du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b), a rascal (m\u016b\u1e0dha), and the lowest of men (nar\u0101dhama). Therefore one should not avoid the association of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, which is now available all over the world in the form of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement."

Therefore, because they are living like trees (for trees are naked but are not conscious), these two young men should receive the bodies of trees. This will be proper punishment. Nonetheless, after they become trees and until they are released, by my mercy they will have remembrance of their past sinful activities. Moreover, by my special favor, after the expiry of one hundred years by the measurement of the demigods, they will be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva, face to face, and thus revive their real position as devotees.",
        "purport": " A tree has no consciousness: when cut, it feels no pain. But N\u0101rada Muni wanted the consciousness of Nalak\u016bvara and Ma\u1e47igr\u012bva to continue, so that even after being released from the life of trees, they would not forget the circumstances under which they had been punished. Therefore, to bestow upon them special favor, N\u0101rada Muni arranged things in such a way that after being released, they would be able to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and thus revive their dormant bhakti. Each day of the demigods in the upper planetary system equals six months of our measurement. Although the demigods in the upper planetary system are attached to material enjoyment, they are all devotees, and therefore they are called demigods. There are two kinds of persons, namely the devas and the asuras. Asuras forget their relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u0101sura\u1e41 bh\u0101vam \u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25), whereas the devas do not forget. The distinction between a pure devotee and a karma-mi\u015bra devotee is this: a pure devotee does not desire anything for material enjoyment, whereas a mixed devotee becomes a devotee to become a first-class enjoyer of this material world. One who is in direct touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service remains pure, uncontaminated by material desires (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam). By karma-mi\u015bra-bhakti one is elevated to the celestial kingdom, by j\u00f1\u0101na-mi\u015bra-bhakti one is able to merge in the Brahman effulgence, and by yoga-mi\u015bra-bhakti one is able to realize the omnipotency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But pure bhakti does not depend on karma, j\u00f1\u0101na or yoga, for it simply consists of loving affairs. The liberation of the bhakta, therefore, which is called not just mukti but vimukti, surpasses the five other kinds of liberation \u2014 s\u0101yujya, s\u0101r\u016bpya, s\u0101lokya, s\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6di and s\u0101m\u012bpya. A pure devotee always engages in pure service (\u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu\u015b\u012blana\u1e41 bhaktir uttam\u0101). Taking birth in the upper planetary system as a demigod is a chance to become a further purified devotee and go back home, back to Godhead. N\u0101rada Muni indirectly gave Ma\u1e47igr\u012bva and Nalak\u016bvara the greatest opportunity by his so-called curse."

But in this case, because N\u0101rada Muni desired that Nalak\u016bvara and Ma\u1e47igr\u012bva see V\u0101sudeva face to face, the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted to fulfill the words of His very dear devotee N\u0101rada Muni.

        "purport": " As stated by Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu (Cc. Madhya 22.54): If by chance one meets a s\u0101dhu, a devotee, one\u2019s life is immediately successful, and one is freed from material bondage. It may be argued that whereas someone may receive a s\u0101dhu with great respect, someone else may not receive a s\u0101dhu with such respect. A s\u0101dhu, however, is always equipoised toward everyone. Because of being a pure devotee, a s\u0101dhu is always ready to deliver K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness without discrimination. As soon as one sees a s\u0101dhu, one naturally becomes free. Nonetheless, persons who are too much offensive, who commit vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dhas, or offenses to a s\u0101dhu, will have to take some time before being rectified. This is also indicated herein."
