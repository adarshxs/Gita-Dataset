Engaging thus in the company of Their friends, the two boys rendered the land of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana most auspicious by imprinting upon it the marks of Their lotus feet.",
        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to encourage His cowherd boyfriends, who had been swallowed by Agh\u0101sura and then stolen by Lord Brahm\u0101. Therefore the Lord decided to bring them into the palm-tree forest called T\u0101lavana, where there were many delicious ripe fruits. Since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s spiritual body had apparently grown slightly in age and strength, the senior men of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, headed by Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, decided to promote K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the task of herding calves to the status of a regular cowherd boy. He would now take care of the full-grown cows, bulls and oxen. Out of great affection, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had previously considered K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a too small and immature to take care of full-grown cows and bulls. It is stated in the K\u0101rttika-m\u0101h\u0101tmya section of the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cThe eighth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the month of K\u0101rttika is known by authorities as Gop\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b. From that day, Lord V\u0101sudeva served as a cowherd, whereas previously He had tended the calves.\u201d The word padai\u1e25 indicates that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a blessed the earth by walking on her surface with His lotus feet. The Lord wore no shoes or other footgear but walked barefoot in the forest, giving great anxiety to the girls of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, who feared that His soft lotus feet would be injured."

Since the spring season is also known as M\u0101dhava, it is understood that as soon as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a entered the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana forest, it automatically exhibited all the opulences of spring, becoming filled with flowers, breezes and a celestial atmosphere. Another reason Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as M\u0101dhava is that He enjoys His pastimes in madhu, the taste of conjugal love. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would loudly sound His flute as He entered the forest of \u015ar\u012b V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, thus giving inconceivable bliss to all the residents of His hometown, Vraja-dh\u0101ma. These simple pastimes of playfully entering the forest, playing on the flute and so forth were performed daily in the spiritual land of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana."

        "purport": " The word g\u016b\u1e0dham is significant in this verse. It indicates that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Balar\u0101ma appears like an ordinary human being within the material world, great sages always recognize the Lord as the Supreme Absolute Truth. All the transcendental forms of Godhead are eternal and full of bliss and knowledge, exactly the opposite of our material bodies, which are temporary and full of misery and ignorance. One meaning of the word t\u012brtha is \u201cthe means for crossing beyond material existence.\u201d Simply by hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord or by chanting them, one immediately comes to the spiritual platform, beyond material existence. Thus the Lord\u2019s transcendental glories are here described as a t\u012brtha for everyone in the world. The word g\u0101yanta\u1e25 indicates that great sages give up their vows of silence and other selfish processes to glorify the activities of the Supreme Lord. Real silence means to not speak nonsense, to limit one\u2019s verbal activities to those sounds, statements and discussions relevant to the loving service of the Supreme Lord. The word anagha indicates that the Supreme Lord never performs sinful or offensive activities. The word also indicates that the Lord immediately excuses a sin or offense committed by a sincere loving devotee who may accidentally deviate from the Lord\u2019s service. In the specific context of this verse, the word anagha indicates that Lord Balar\u0101ma was not disturbed by the bees who were constantly following Him (anupatham). The Lord blessed them by saying, \u201cO bees, come into My confidential grove and feel free to taste its fragrance.\u201d"

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statement that \u201cthis earth has now become most fortunate\u201d (dhanyeyam adya dhara\u1e47\u012b) indicates that nothing can equal the blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His personal form as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appearing simultaneously with His plenary expansion, Balar\u0101ma. The compound word karaj\u0101bhim\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25, \u201ctouched by Your fingernails,\u201d indicates that as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma would move through the forest They would pick fruits and flowers from the trees, bushes and creepers and use this paraphernalia in Their pleasure pastimes. Sometimes They would break leaves off the plants and use them with the flowers to decorate Their bodies. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma would glance lovingly and mercifully at all the rivers, hills and creatures in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. But the blessing received by the gop\u012bs \u2014 being embraced directly between the Lord\u2019s arms \u2014 was the supreme benediction, desired even by the goddess of fortune herself. The goddess of fortune, who lives in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha on the chest of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, once desired to be embraced on the chest of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus she performed severe austerities to achieve this blessing. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a informed her that her actual place was in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and that it was not possible for her to dwell upon His chest in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Therefore she begged K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to allow her to remain on His chest in the form of a golden line, and He granted her this benediction. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura recounts this incident from the Pur\u0101\u1e47as."

When the beloved accepts her offering of love by receiving her glance and is thus satisfied with her, the loving young girl\u2019s heart becomes filled with happiness. These were exactly the romantic exchanges taking place between beautiful young K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the loving cowherd girls of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana."
