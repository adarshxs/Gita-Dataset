In fact, the Lord is truly reciprocating. After all, a sincere devotee always prays to the Lord, \u201cPlease help me to love You purely.\u201d Therefore the Lord\u2019s so-called neglect is actually the fulfillment of the devotee\u2019s prayer. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a intensifies our love for Him by apparently separating Himself from us, and the result is that we achieve what we really wanted and prayed for: intense love for the Absolute Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s apparent negligence is actually His thoughtful reciprocation and the fulfillment of our deepest and purest desire. According to the \u0101c\u0101ryas, as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a began to speak this verse the gop\u012bs looked at one another with squinting eyes, trying to hide the smiles breaking out on their faces. Even as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was speaking, the gop\u012bs had begun to realize that He was bringing them to the highest perfection of loving service."
