        "purport": " Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is situated in His own transcendental position, beyond the material energy. Why, therefore, should His worship bear the fruit of material opulence? The real fruit of worshiping Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is transcendental knowledge. Thus Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s worshiper gains the eye of transcendental knowledge instead of being blinded by mundane assets. The Lord being the detached witness of the material creation, His devotee also becomes aloof from the interaction of the Lord\u2019s inferior energies. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b cites the following passage from the Vedic literature: \u201cWhen the absolute reality associates with the modes of nature, He assumes two different kinds of form in this world, according to whether His spiritual qualities are manifest or not. Thus He acts just like a reflection and its further, secondary reflection.\u201d \u201cThe modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, whose individual natures are peaceful, violent and foolish, are personally regulated by Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, respectively.\u201d \u201cLord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s peaceful mode of goodness does not differ substantially from His original, spiritual qualities, although it is only a partial manifestation of them within this world. Thus Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s mode of goodness is never tainted by agitation [in passion] or delusion [in ignorance].\u201d \u201cBy the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, the original, spiritual qualities of Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord Rudra are obscured. Thus these spiritual qualities appear only partially, as separated, material qualities.\u201d \u201cTherefore focusing one\u2019s consciousness upon Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the embodiment of all goodness, leads one to liberation. Such God consciousness also generates material success as a by-product, but its proper nature is pure spiritual ecstasy.\u201d \u201cAccording to their mode of worship, devotees of Brahm\u0101, Rudra and other demigods obtain the limited success of material opulences. Eventually they may possibly become qualified for full liberation.\u201d This same idea is echoed in the following statement of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.23): \u015brey\u0101\u1e41si tatra khalu sattva-tanor n\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101m syu\u1e25. \u201cOf these three [Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u015aiva], all human beings can derive ultimate benefit from Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the form of the quality of goodness.\u201d"

        "purport": " Devotees of the Supreme Lord experience both happiness and distress \u2014 not as consequences of material work but as incidental effects of their loving reciprocation with the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, in \u015ar\u012b Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu, his definitive treatise on the process of devotional service, explains how a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is relieved of all karmic reactions, including those that have not yet begun to manifest (apr\u0101rabdha), those that are just about to manifest (k\u016b\u1e6da), those that are barely manifesting (b\u012bja) and those that have manifested fully (pr\u0101rabdha). As a lotus gradually loses its many petals, so a person who takes shelter of devotional service has all his karmic reactions destroyed. That devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a eradicates all karmic reactions is confirmed in this passage of the Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b \u015bruti (P\u016brva 15): bhaktir asya bhajana\u1e41 tad ih\u0101mutrop\u0101dhi-nair\u0101syen\u0101mu\u1e63min mana\u1e25-kalpanam etad eva nai\u1e63karmyam. \u201cDevotional service is the process of worshiping the Supreme Lord. It consists of fixing the mind upon Him by becoming disinterested in all material designations, both in this life and the next. It results in the dissolution of all karma.\u201d While it is certainly true that those who practice devotional service remain in material bodies and apparently material situations for some time, this is simply an expression of the inconceivable mercy of the Lord, who bestows the fruits of devotion only when it has become pure. In every stage of devotion, however, the Lord watches over His devotee and sees to the gradual elimination of his karma. Thus despite the fact that the happiness and distress devotees experience resemble ordinary karmic reactions, they are in fact given by the Lord Himself. As the Bh\u0101gavatam (10.87.40) states, bhavad-uttha-\u015bubh\u0101\u015bubhayo\u1e25: A mature devotee recognizes the superficially good and bad conditions he encounters as signs of the direct guidance of his ever well-wishing Lord. But if the Lord is so compassionate to His devotees, why does He expose them to special suffering? This is answered by an analogy: A very affectionate father takes the responsibility of restricting his children\u2019s play and making them go to school. He knows that this is a genuine expression of his love for them, even if the children fail to understand. Similarly, the Supreme Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is mercifully strict with all His dependents, not only with immature devotees struggling to become qualified. Even perfect saints like Prahl\u0101da, Dhruva and Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira were subjected to great tribulations, all for their glorification. After the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, \u015ar\u012b Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva described to King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira his wonder at this: \u201cOh, how wonderful is the influence of inevitable time! It is irreversible \u2014 otherwise, how can there be reverses in the presence of King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, the son of the demigod controlling religion; Bh\u012bma, the great fighter with a club; the great bowman Arjuna with his mighty weapon G\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bva; and above all, the Lord, the direct well-wisher of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas? O King, no one can know the plan of the Lord [\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a]. Even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.9.15-16) Although a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u2019s happiness and distress are felt as pleasure and pain, just like ordinary karmic reactions, they are different in a significant sense. Material happiness and distress, arising from karma, leave a subtle residue \u2014 the seed of future entanglement. Such enjoyment and suffering tend toward degradation and increase the danger of falling into hellish oblivion. Happiness and distress generated from the Supreme Lord\u2019s desires, however, leave no trace after their immediate purpose has been served. Moreover, the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava who enjoys such reciprocation with the Lord is in no danger of falling down into nescience. As Yamar\u0101ja, the lord of death and the judge of all departed souls, declares: \u201cMy dear servants, please bring to me only those sinful persons who do not use their tongues to chant the holy name and qualities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whose hearts do not remember the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a even once, and whose heads do not bow down even once before Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Send me those who do not perform their duties toward Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, which are the only duties in human life. Please bring me all such fools and rascals.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 6.3.29) The beloved devotees of the Lord do not regard as very troublesome the suffering He imposes on them. Indeed, they find that in the end it gives rise to unlimited pleasure, just as a stinging ointment applied by a physician cures his patient\u2019s infected eye. In addition, suffering helps protect the confidentiality of devotional service by discouraging intrusions by the faithless, and it also increases the eagerness with which the devotees call upon the Lord to appear. If the devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u were complacently happy all the time, He would never have a reason to appear in this world as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, R\u0101macandra, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha and so on. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.8): \u201cTo deliver the pious and annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium.\u201d And without the Lord\u2019s showing Himself on earth in His original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and in the forms of various incarnations, His faithful servants in this world would have no opportunity to enjoy His r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101 and other pastimes. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b here counters a possible objection: \u201cWhat fault would there be in God\u2019s incarnating for some other reason than to deliver saintly persons from suffering?\u201d The learned \u0101c\u0101rya responds, \u201cYes, my dear brother, this makes good sense, but you are not expert in understanding spiritual moods. Please listen: It is at night that the sunrise becomes attractive, during the hot summer that cold water gives comfort, and during the cold winter months that warm water is pleasing. Lamplight appears attractive in darkness, not in the glaring light of day, and when one is distressed by hunger, food tastes especially good.\u201d In other words, to strengthen his devotees\u2019 mood of dependence on Him and longing for Him, the Lord arranges for His devotees to go through some suffering, and when He appears in order to deliver them, their gratitude and transcendental pleasure are boundless."
