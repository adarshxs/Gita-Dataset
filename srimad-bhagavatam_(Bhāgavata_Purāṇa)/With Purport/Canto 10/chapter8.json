        "purport": " As factually stated by Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Garga Muni, being a devotee, had no needs. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes He has no needs, for He is p\u016br\u1e47a, \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma. Nonetheless, He descends to this material world to protect the devotees and vanquish miscreants (paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m). This is the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and devotees also have the same mission. One who executes this mission of para-upak\u0101ra, performing welfare activities for people in general, is recognized by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as being very, very dear to Him (na ca tasm\u0101n manu\u1e63ye\u1e63u ka\u015bcin me priya-k\u1e5bttama\u1e25). Similarly, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has advised this para-upak\u0101ra, and He has especially advised the inhabitants of India: \u201cOne who has taken his birth as a human being in the land of India [Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a] should make his life successful and work for the benefit of all other people.\u201d (Cc. \u0100di 9.41) On the whole, the duty of a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotee is to act for the welfare of others. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja could understand that Garga Muni had come for this purpose and that his own duty now was to act according to Garga Muni\u2019s advice. Thus he said, \u201cPlease tell me what is my duty.\u201d This should be the attitude of everyone, especially the householder. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama society is organized into eight divisions: br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, \u015b\u016bdra, brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja represented himself as g\u1e5bhi\u1e47\u0101m, a householder. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b factually has no needs, but g\u1e5bh\u012bs, householders, are engaged in sense gratification. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.44), bhogai\u015bvarya-prasakt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 tay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-cetas\u0101m. Everyone has come to this material world for sense gratification, and the position of those who are too attached to sense gratification and who therefore accept the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama is very precarious. Since everyone in this material world is searching for sense gratification, g\u1e5bhasthas are required to be trained as mahat, great mah\u0101tm\u0101s. Therefore Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja specifically used the word mahad-vicalanam. Garga Muni had no interest to serve by going to Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, but Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, as a g\u1e5bhastha, was always perfectly ready to receive instructions from a mah\u0101tm\u0101 to gain the real benefit in life. Thus he was ready to execute Garga Muni\u2019s order."

By the strength of this knowledge, any human being can understand what he has done in his past life and how it affects his present life. This is known to you.",
        "purport": " The word \u201cdestiny\u201d is now defined. Unintelligent persons who do not understand the meaning of life are just like animals. Animals do not know the past, present and future of life, nor are they able to understand it. But a human being can understand this, if he is sober. Therefore, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.13), dh\u012bras tatra na muhyati: a sober person is not bewildered. The simple truth is that although life is eternal, in this material world one changes from one body to another. Foolish people, especially in this age, do not understand this simple truth. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cAs the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d (Bg. 2.13) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the greatest authority, says that the body will change. And as soon as the body changes, one\u2019s whole program of work changes also. Today I am a human being or a great personality, but with a little deviation from nature\u2019s law, I shall have to accept a different type of body. Today I am a human being, but tomorrow I may become a dog, and then whatever activities I have performed in this life will be a failure. This simple truth is now rarely understood, but one who is a dh\u012bra can understand this. Those in this material world for material enjoyment should know that because their present position will cease to exist, they must be careful in how they act. This is also stated by \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva. Na s\u0101dhu manye yata \u0101tmano\u00a0\u2019yam asann api kle\u015bada \u0101sa deha\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 5.5.4). Although this body is temporary, as long as we have to live in this body we must suffer. Whether one has a short life or a long life, one must suffer the threefold miseries of material life. Therefore any gentleman, dh\u012bra, must be interested in jyoti\u1e63a, astrology. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was trying to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by Garga Muni\u2019s presence, for Garga Muni was a great authority in this knowledge of astrology, by which one can see the unseen events of past, present and future. It is the duty of a father to understand the astrological position of his children and do what is needed for their happiness. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the presence of Garga Muni, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja suggested that Garga Muni prepare a horoscope for Nanda\u2019s two sons, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma."

        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13), c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25: the four var\u1e47as \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra \u2014 must be present in society. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as are required for the guidance of the whole society. If there is no such institution as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma and if human society has no such guide as the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, human society will be hellish. In Kali-yuga, especially at the present moment, there is no such thing as a real br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and therefore society is in a chaotic condition. Formerly there were qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but at present, although there are certainly persons who think themselves br\u0101hma\u1e47as, they actually have no ability to guide society. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore very much eager to reintroduce the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system into human society so that those who are bewildered or less intelligent will be able to take guidance from qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Br\u0101hma\u1e47a means Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. After one becomes a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the next stage of development in human society is to become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. People in general must be guided to the destination or goal of life, and therefore they must understand Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The whole system of Vedic knowledge is based on this principle, but people have lost the clue (na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um), and they are simply pursuing sense gratification, with the risk of gliding down to a lower grade of life (m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani). It doesn\u2019t matter whether one is born a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or not. No one is born a br\u0101hma\u1e47a; everyone is born a \u015b\u016bdra. But by the guidance of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and by sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, one can become dvija, twice-born, and then gradually become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism is not a system meant to create a monopoly for a particular class of men. Everyone should be educated so as to become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. At least there must be an opportunity to allow everyone to attain the destination of life. Regardless of whether one is born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family, a k\u1e63atriya family or a \u015b\u016bdra family, one may be guided by a proper br\u0101hma\u1e47a and be promoted to the highest platform of being a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Thus the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement affords an opportunity to develop the right destiny for human society. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja took advantage of the opportunity of Garga Muni\u2019s presence by requesting him to perform the necessary reformatory activities for his sons to guide Them toward the destination of life."

Therefore, since Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja presented himself as a vai\u015bya, this process of purification was essential. Formerly, such institutional activities were compulsory.

How degraded society has become within five thousand years. Mand\u0101\u1e25 sumanda-matayo manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101\u1e25. The human life is obtained after many, many millions of births, and it is intended for purification.

In the past, He assumed three different colors \u2014 white, red and yellow \u2014 and now He has appeared in a blackish color. [In another Dv\u0101para-yuga, He appeared (as Lord R\u0101macandra) in the color of \u015buka, a parrot. All such incarnations have now assembled in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.]",
        "purport": " Partially explaining the position of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and partially covering the facts, Garga Muni indicated, \u201cYour son is a great personality, and He can change the color of His body in different ages.\u201d The word g\u1e5bh\u1e47ata\u1e25 indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is free to make His choice. In other words, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and may therefore do whatever He desires. In Vedic literature the different colors assumed by the Personality of Godhead in different millenniums are stated, and therefore when Garga Muni said, \u201cYour son has assumed these colors,\u201d he indirectly said, \u201cHe is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d Because of Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s atrocities, Garga Muni tried to avoid disclosing this fact, but he indirectly informed Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his son, was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It may be noted that \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, in his book Krama-sandarbha, has enunciated the purport of this verse. In every millennium, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in a different form, either as white, red or yellow, but this time He personally appeared in His original, blackish form and, as predicted by Garga Muni, exhibited the power of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Because in this form the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibits Himself fully, His name is \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the all-attractive. Factually, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of all avat\u0101ras, and therefore all the different features of the different avat\u0101ras are present in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a incarnates, all the features of other incarnations are already present within Him. Other incarnations are partial representations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the full-fledged incarnation of the Supreme Being. It is to be understood that the Supreme Being, whether appearing as \u015bukla, rakta or p\u012bta (white, red or yellow), is the same person. When He appears in different incarnations, He appears in different colors, just like the sunshine, which contains seven colors. Sometimes the colors of sunshine are represented separately; otherwise the sunshine is observed mainly as bright light. The different avat\u0101ras, such as the manvantara-avat\u0101ras, l\u012bl\u0101-avat\u0101ras and da\u015ba-avat\u0101ras, are all included in the k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-avat\u0101ra. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears, all the avat\u0101ras appear with Him. As described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.3.26): The avat\u0101ras incessantly appear, like incessantly flowing water. No one can count how many waves there are in flowing water, and similarly there is no limitation of the avat\u0101ras. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the full representation of all avat\u0101ras because He is the source of all avat\u0101ras. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a\u1e41\u015b\u012b, whereas others are a\u1e41\u015ba, part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All living entities, including us, are a\u1e41\u015bas (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25). These a\u1e41\u015bas are of different magnitude. Human beings (who are minute a\u1e41\u015bas) and the demigods, vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva and all other living beings are all part of the Supreme. Nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the full representation of all living entities, and when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present, all avat\u0101ras are included in Him. The Eleventh Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam describes the incarnations for each yuga in chronological order. The Bh\u0101gavatam says, k\u1e5bte \u015bukla\u015b catur-b\u0101hu\u1e25, tret\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 rakta-var\u1e47o\u2019sau, dv\u0101pare bhagav\u0101n \u015by\u0101ma\u1e25 and k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tvi\u1e63\u0101k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47am. We actually see that in Kali-yuga, Bhagav\u0101n has appeared in p\u012bta-var\u1e47a, or a yellow color, as Gaurasundara, although the Bh\u0101gavatam speaks of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47am. To adjust all these statements, one should understand that although in some yugas some of the colors are prominent, in every yuga, whenever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears, all the colors are present. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tvi\u1e63\u0101k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47am: although Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu appears without k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or a blackish color, He is understood to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Id\u0101n\u012b\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47at\u0101\u1e41 gata\u1e25. The same original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who appears in different var\u1e47as has now appeared. The word \u0101san indicates that He is always present. Whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in His full feature, He is understood to be k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47am, although He appears in different colors. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja states that Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is channa; that is, although He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He is covered by a yellow color. Thus the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas accept the conclusion that although Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu appeared in p\u012bta color, He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.33), the Lord is one, but He has many forms and many names. It was not that because Garga Muni gave the child the name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that was His only name. He has other names, such as Bhaktavatsala, Giridh\u0101r\u012b, Govinda and Gop\u0101la. If we analyze the nirukti, or semantic derivation, of the word \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d we find that na signifies that He stops the repetition of birth and death, and k\u1e5b\u1e63 means satt\u0101rtha, or \u201cexistence.\u201d (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the whole of existence.) Also, k\u1e5b\u1e63 means \u201cattraction,\u201d and na means \u0101nanda, or \u201cbliss.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as Mukunda because He wants to give everyone spiritual, eternal, blissful life. Unfortunately, because of the living entity\u2019s little independence, the living entity wants to \u201cdeprogram\u201d the program of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the material disease. Nonetheless, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants to give transcendental bliss to the living entities, He appears in various forms. Therefore He is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Because Garga Muni was an astrologer, he knew what others did not know. Yet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has so many names that even Garga Muni did not know them all. It is to be concluded that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, according to His transcendental activities, has many names and many forms."

He is asamordhva: no one is equal to Him, and no one is greater than He is.

But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would simply smile, and they would forget everything. Sometimes, in their presence, He would begin eating the curd and butter. There was no need for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to eat butter, since His belly was always full, but He would try to eat it, or else He would break the pots and distribute the contents to the monkeys. In this way, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was always engaged in mischief-making. If in any house He could not find any butter or curd to steal, He would go into a room and agitate the small children sleeping there by pinching them, and when they cried He would go away."

Let me simply offer my obeisances, for He is beyond my contemplation, speculation and meditation. He is beyond all of my material activities.",
        "purport": " One simply has to realize the greatness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should not try to understand Him by any material means, subtle or gross. Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, being a simple woman, could not find out the real cause of the vision; therefore, out of maternal affection, she simply offered obeisances unto the Supreme Lord to protect her child. She could do nothing but offer obeisances to the Lord. It is said, acinty\u0101\u1e25 khalu ye bh\u0101v\u0101 na t\u0101\u1e41s tarke\u1e47a yojayet (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma parva 5.22). One should not try to understand the supreme cause by argument or reasoning. When we are beset by some problem for which we can find no reason, there is no alternative than to surrender to the Supreme Lord and offer Him our respectful obeisances. Then our position will be secure. This was the means adopted in this instance also by mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. Whatever happens, the original cause is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am). When the immediate cause cannot be ascertained, let us simply offer our obeisances at the lotus feet of the Lord. Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 concluded that the wonderful things she saw within the mouth of her child were due to Him, although she could not clearly ascertain the cause. Therefore when a devotee cannot ascertain the cause of suffering, he concludes: The devotee accepts that it is due to his own past misdeeds that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has caused him some small amount of suffering. Thus he offers obeisances to the Lord again and again. Such a devotee is called mukti-pade sa d\u0101ya-bh\u0101k; that is, he is guaranteed his liberation from this material world. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14): We should know that material suffering due to the material body will come and go. Therefore we must tolerate the suffering and proceed with discharging our duty as ordained by our spiritual master."

        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15) by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the purpose of studying the Vedas is to understand Him (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu explained to San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b that there are three purposes in the Vedas. One is to understand our relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (sambandha), another is to act according to that relationship (abhidheya), and the third is to reach the ultimate goal (prayojana). The word prayojana means \u201cnecessities,\u201d and the ultimate necessity is explained by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Prem\u0101 pum-artho mah\u0101n: the greatest necessity for a human being is the achievement of love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here we see that mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 is on the highest stage of necessity, for she is completely absorbed in love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the beginning, the Vedic purpose is pursued in three ways (tray\u012b) \u2014 by karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da and up\u0101san\u0101-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. When one reaches the complete, perfect stage of up\u0101san\u0101-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, one comes to worship N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. When P\u0101rvat\u012b asked Lord Mah\u0101deva, Lord \u015aiva, what is the best method of up\u0101san\u0101, or worship, Lord \u015aiva answered, \u0101r\u0101dhan\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47or \u0101r\u0101dhana\u1e41 param. Vi\u1e63\u1e47\u016bp\u0101san\u0101, or vi\u1e63\u1e47v-\u0101r\u0101dhana, worship of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is the highest stage of perfection, as realized by Devak\u012b. But here mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 performs no up\u0101san\u0101, for she has developed transcendental ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore her position is better than that of Devak\u012b. In order to show this, \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva enunciates this verse, trayy\u0101 copani\u1e63adbhi\u1e25 etc. When a human being enters into the study of the Vedas to obtain vidy\u0101, knowledge, he begins to take part in human civilization. Then he advances further to study the Upani\u1e63ads and gain brahma-j\u00f1\u0101na, impersonal realization of the Absolute Truth, and then he advances still further, to s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga, in order to understand the supreme controller, who is indicated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n/ puru\u1e63a\u1e41 \u015b\u0101\u015bvatam). When one understands that puru\u1e63a, the supreme controller, to be Param\u0101tm\u0101, one is engaged in the method of yoga (dhy\u0101n\u0101vasthita-tad-gatena manas\u0101 pa\u015byanti ya\u1e41 yogina\u1e25). But mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 has surpassed all these stages. She has come to the platform of loving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as her beloved child, and therefore she is accepted to be on the highest stage of spiritual realization. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features (brahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate), but she is in such ecstasy that she does not care to understand what is Brahman, what is Param\u0101tm\u0101 or what is Bhagav\u0101n. Bhagav\u0101n has personally descended to become her beloved child. Therefore there is no comparison to mother Ya\u015bod\u0101\u2019s good fortune, as declared by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu (ramy\u0101 k\u0101cid up\u0101san\u0101 vrajavadh\u016b-varge\u1e47a y\u0101 kalpit\u0101). The Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, may be realized in different stages. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.11): \u201cAs men surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101.\u201d One may be a karm\u012b, a j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, a yog\u012b and then a bhakta or prema-bhakta. But the ultimate stage of realization is prema-bhakti, as actually demonstrated by mother Ya\u015bod\u0101."

This means that whenever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends, Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101, as well as Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, also descend as the Lord\u2019s father and mother. Their personalities are expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal body; they are not ordinary living beings. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it knew this, but he was curious to know from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b whether it is possible for an ordinary human being to come to this stage by s\u0101dhana-siddhi. There are two kinds of perfection \u2014 nitya-siddhi and s\u0101dhana-siddhi. A nitya-siddha is one who is eternally K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s associate, an expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal body, whereas a s\u0101dhana-siddha is an ordinary human being who, by executing pious activities and following regulative principles of devotional service, also comes to that stage. Thus the purpose of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it\u2019s inquiry was to determine whether an ordinary human being can attain the position of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b answered this question as follows."

        "translation": "Dro\u1e47a and Dhar\u0101 said: Please permit us to be born on the planet earth so that after our appearance, the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller and master of all planets, will also appear and spread devotional service, the ultimate goal of life, so that those born in this material world may very easily be delivered from the miserable condition of materialistic life by accepting this devotional service.",
        "purport": " This statement by Dro\u1e47a clearly indicates that Dro\u1e47a and Dhar\u0101 are the eternal father and mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Whenever there is a necessity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance, Dro\u1e47a and Dhar\u0101 appear first, and then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that His birth is not ordinary (janma karma ca me divyam). \u201cAlthough I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.\u201d (Bg. 4.6) Before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance, Dro\u1e47a and Dhar\u0101 appear in order to become His father and mother. It is they who appear as Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and his wife, Ya\u015bod\u0101. In other words, it is not possible for a s\u0101dhana-siddha living being to become the father or mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s father and mother are already designated. But by following the principles exhibited by Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Ya\u015bod\u0101 and their associates, the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, ordinary living beings may attain such affection as exhibited by Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101. When Dro\u1e47a and Dhar\u0101 were requested to beget children, they chose to come to this world to have the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance means paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m \u2014 the devotees are protected, and the miscreants are vanquished. Whenever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes, He distributes the highest goal of life, devotional service. He appears as Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu for the same purpose because unless one comes to devotional service, one cannot be delivered from the miseries of the material world (du\u1e25kh\u0101layam a\u015b\u0101\u015bvatam), where the living beings struggle for existence. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7): \u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Because of conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\u201d The living entities are struggling to become happy, but unless they take to the bhakti cult, their happiness is not possible. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says: \u201cThose who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world.\u201d (Bg. 9.3) Foolish persons do not know how risky life is here if one does not follow the instructions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, therefore, has been started so that by practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one can avoid the risky life of this material existence. There is no question of accepting or not accepting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is not optional; it is compulsory. If we do not take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, our life is very risky. Everything is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Therefore, to learn how to become free from the miserable condition of material existence, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is is the preliminary study. Then, if one understands Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one can proceed to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and if one advances further, one may study Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta. We are therefore presenting these invaluable books to the whole world so that people may study them and be happy, being delivered from miserable conditional life."
