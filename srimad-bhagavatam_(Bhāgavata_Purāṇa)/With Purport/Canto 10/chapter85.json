        "purport": " To casual observers the known world appears to be produced by many different agents. A good indication of this conception is language itself, which traditional Sanskrit grammarians explain as reflecting the visible diversity of nature. In the standard Sanskrit grammar taught by the sage P\u0101\u1e47ini, the verb, expressing action, is taken to be the essential core of a sentence, and all the other words function in relation to it. Nouns, for example, are put into any of several cases to show their particular relationship to the verb in a sentence. These relationships of noun to verb are called k\u0101rakas, namely the relations of subject (kart\u0101, \u201cwho does\u201d), object (karma, \u201cwhat is done\u201d), instrument (kara\u1e47a, \u201cby which\u201d), recipient (samprad\u0101na, \u201cfor or toward which\u201d), source (apad\u0101na, \u201cfrom or because of which\u201d) and location (adhikara\u1e47a, \u201cin which\u201d). Apart from these k\u0101rakas, nouns may also sometimes point to other nouns in a possessive sense, and there are also various kinds of adverbs of time, place and manner. But although language thus seems to indicate the activity of many separate agents in the manifest creation, the deeper truth is that all grammatical forms refer first of all to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse Vasudeva makes this point by glorifying his two exalted sons in terms of the different grammatical forms."

        "purport": " Pr\u0101\u1e47a is the vital air of life, a more subtle element than the ordinary air we can touch. And because pr\u0101\u1e47a is so subtle \u2014 finer than the tangible manifestations of creation \u2014 it is sometimes considered the ultimate source of everything. But even subtle energies such as pr\u0101\u1e47a depend for their functional capacity on the supremely subtle Param\u0101tm\u0101. That is the idea Vasudeva expresses here by the word p\u0101ratantry\u0101t, \u201cbecause of dependence.\u201d Just as the velocity of an arrow is derived from the strength of the bowman who shoots it, so all subordinate energies depend on the power of the Supreme Lord. Furthermore, even when various subtle causes have been empowered with their capacity to act, they cannot act in concert without the Supersoul\u2019s coordinating direction. As Lord Brahm\u0101 states in his description of creation in the Second Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: \u201cO N\u0101rada, best of the transcendentalists, the forms of the body cannot manifest as long as these created parts, namely the elements, senses, mind and modes of nature, are not assembled. Thus when all these became assembled by the force of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this universe certainly came into being by accepting both the primary and secondary causes of creation.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.5.32-33)"

Vasudeva had been reminded of his sons\u2019 greatness by hearing the sages gathered at Kuruk\u1e63etra. But his sense of awe was ruining his intimate parental relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to dispel it. We should not misunderstand the \u201coneness\u201d Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speaks of here. The subtle words of the Upani\u1e63ads often mislead impersonalists into believing that all existence is ineffably one, without any variety in the ultimate issue. Some Upani\u1e63adic mantras emphasize the sameness of God and His creation, while others speak about their difference. Tat tvam asi \u015bvetaketo (\u201cYou are that, O \u015avetaketu\u201d), for example, is an abheda-v\u0101kya, a mantra affirming that all things are one with God, being His dependent expansions. But the Upani\u1e63ads also contain many bheda-v\u0101kyas, statements that affirm the unique, distinguishing qualities of the Supreme, such as this statement: ka ev\u0101ny\u0101t ka\u1e25 pr\u0101\u1e47y\u0101d yady e\u1e63a \u0101k\u0101\u015ba \u0101nando na sy\u0101t, e\u1e63a ev\u0101nandayati. \u201cWho would there be to activate the creation and give life to all beings if this infinite Supreme were not the original enjoyer? Indeed, He alone is the source of all pleasure.\u201d (Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad. 2.7.1) By the influence of the Supreme Lord\u2019s bewildering M\u0101y\u0101, envious impersonalists read the abheda-v\u0101kyas literally and accept the bheda-v\u0101kyas only in a figurative way. Authoritative Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava commentators, on the other hand, carefully reconcile the apparent contradictions in accordance with the interpretive principles of Vedic M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 and the logically established conclusions of Ved\u0101nta."

Previously she had heard with astonishment that They had brought Their spiritual master\u2019s son back from death. Now, thinking of her own sons who had been murdered by Ka\u1e41sa, she felt great sorrow, and thus with tear-filled eyes she beseeched K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma.",

In a different way, Devak\u012b\u2019s love was somewhat distracted by her lamentation for her dead sons. So K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a arranged to relieve her of the mistaken idea that anyone else but Him was actually her son. Since Devak\u012b is known to be worshiped by all great souls, her show of maternal affection must actually have been an effect of the Lord\u2019s Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, who increases the pleasure of His pastimes.

There are nine standard processes of devotional service, and the last, \u0101tma-samarpa\u1e47am, as taught by Bali Daityar\u0101ja, is the culmination toward which every endeavor should aim. If one tries to impress the Lord with wealth, power, intelligence and so on but fails to humbly understand oneself to be His servant, one\u2019s so-called devotion is only a presumptuous show."

The Yak\u1e63as, R\u0101k\u1e63asas, Pi\u015b\u0101cas and so on tend to be inimical because they are generally covered by ignorance. There are some rascals in the pure mode of ignorance, like \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la and Pau\u1e47\u1e0draka, who are totally absorbed in meditation on the Lord as their enemy, and this fixed consciousness earns them liberation. Others, in a mixed condition of passion and ignorance, associate with the Lord with a desire for position and prestige; Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bali sees himself as belonging to this category. Yet Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u favored Bali by becoming his doorkeeper in the subterranean region of Sutala, just as He favored the demons by killing and liberating them, and the Gandharvas by engaging them in singing His glories. On the other hand, the Lord awards sense gratification to those demigods who are proud of their being situated in the mode of goodness; thus they become deluded and forget Him."
