        "purport": " At the end of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b summarized the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He spoke of how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had personally appeared to reduce the burden on the earth, how He had manifested His pastimes as a householder, and how, soon after His birth, He had transferred Himself to His Vrajabh\u016bmi-l\u012bl\u0101. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, being naturally a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, wanted to hear more about Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, to encourage \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b to continue speaking about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and give further details, he thanked \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b for having described the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in brief. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b had said: \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, known as l\u012bl\u0101-puru\u1e63ottama, appeared as the son of Vasudeva but immediately left His father\u2019s home and went to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to expand His loving relationships with His confidential devotees. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana the Lord killed many demons, and afterward He returned to Dv\u0101rak\u0101, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 9.24.66) The Yadu dynasty belonged to the family descending from Soma, the moon-god. Although the planetary systems are so arranged that the sun comes first, before the moon, Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja gave more respect to the dynasty of the moon-god, the soma-va\u1e41\u015ba, because in the Y\u0101dava dynasty, descending from the moon, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had appeared. There are two different k\u1e63atriya families of the royal order, one descending from the king of the moon planet and the other descending from the king of the sun. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He generally appears in a k\u1e63atriya family because He comes to establish religious principles and the life of righteousness. According to the Vedic system, the k\u1e63atriya family is the protector of the human race. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as Lord R\u0101macandra, He appeared in the s\u016brya-va\u1e41\u015ba, the family descending from the sun-god, and when He appeared as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He did so in the Yadu dynasty, or yadu-va\u1e41\u015ba, whose descent was from the moon-god. In the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, there is a long list of the kings of the yadu-va\u1e41\u015ba. All the kings in both the soma-va\u1e41\u015ba and s\u016brya-va\u1e41\u015ba were great and powerful, and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it praised them very highly (r\u0101j\u00f1\u0101\u1e41 cobhaya-va\u1e41\u015by\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 carita\u1e41 param\u0101dbhutam). Nonetheless, he wanted to hear more about the soma-va\u1e41\u015ba because that was the dynasty in which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had appeared. The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is described in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as the abode of cint\u0101ma\u1e47i: cint\u0101ma\u1e47i-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-v\u1e5bk\u1e63a-lak\u1e63\u0101v\u1e5bte\u1e63u surabh\u012br abhip\u0101layantam. The V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana-dh\u0101ma on this earth is a replica of that same abode. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.20), in the spiritual sky there is another, eternal nature, transcendental to manifested and unmanifested matter. The manifested world can be seen in the form of many stars and planets such as the sun and moon, but beyond this is the unmanifested, which is imperceptible to those who are embodied. And beyond this unmanifested matter is the spiritual kingdom, which is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as supreme and eternal. That kingdom is never annihilated. Although material nature is subject to repeated creation and annihilation, that spiritual nature remains as it is eternally. In the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, that spiritual nature, the spiritual world, is described as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or Vraja-dh\u0101ma. The elaborate description of the above-mentioned \u015bloka from the Ninth Canto \u2014 j\u0101to gata\u1e25 pit\u1e5b-g\u1e5bh\u0101d (Bh\u0101g. 9.24.66) \u2014 will be found here, in the Tenth Canto."

        "purport": " The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.1) explains that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva. \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes.\u201d \u201cThe Brahm\u0101s, the heads of the innumerable universes, live only for the duration of one breath of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. I worship Govinda, the original Lord, of whom Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is but a portion of a plenary portion.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.48) Govinda, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the original Personality of Godhead. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam. Even Lord Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who by His breathing creates many millions upon millions of universes, is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s kal\u0101-vi\u015be\u1e63a, or plenary portion of a plenary portion. Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is a plenary expansion of Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, who is a plenary expansion of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is a plenary expansion of the catur-vy\u016bha, and the catur-vy\u016bha are plenary expansions of Baladeva, the first manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared with Baladeva, all the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattvas appeared with Him. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it requested \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b to describe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His glorious activities. Another meaning may be derived from this verse as follows, Although \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b was the greatest muni, he could describe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only partially (a\u1e41\u015bena), for no one can describe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fully. It is said that Anantadeva has thousands of heads, but although He tries to describe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with thousands of tongues, His descriptions are still incomplete."

        "purport": " In India it is the practice among the general populace to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, either from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, in order to gain relief from the disease of repeated birth and death. Although India is now fallen, when there is a message that someone will speak about Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, thousands of people still gather to hear. This verse indicates, however, that such recitation of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam must be done by persons completely freed from material desires (niv\u1e5btta-tar\u1e63ai\u1e25). Everyone within this material world, beginning from Brahm\u0101 down to the insignificant ant, is full of material desires for sense enjoyment, and everyone is busy in sense gratification, but when thus engaged one cannot fully understand the value of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, either in the form of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. If we hear the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from liberated persons, this hearing will certainly free us from the bondage of material activities, but hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam spoken by a professional reciter cannot actually help us achieve liberation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 is very simple. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As He Himself explains, matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat ki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1jaya: \u201cO Arjuna, there is no truth superior to Me.\u201d (Bg. 7.7) Simply by understanding this fact \u2014 that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 one can become a liberated person. But, especially in this age, because people are interested in hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from unscrupulous persons who depart from the simple presentation of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and distort it for their personal satisfaction, they fail to derive the real benefit. There are big scholars, politicians, philosophers and scientists who speak on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in their own polluted way, and people in general hear from them, being uninterested in hearing the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from a devotee. A devotee is one who has no other motive for reciting Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam than to serve the Lord. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has therefore advised us to hear the glories of the Lord from a realized person (bh\u0101gavata paro diya bh\u0101gavata sthane). Unless one is personally a realized soul in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, a neophyte should not approach him to hear about the Lord, for this is strictly forbidden by \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who quotes from the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: One should avoid hearing from a person not situated in Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava behavior. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is niv\u1e5btta-t\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that is, he has no material purpose, for his only purpose is to preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. So-called scholars, philosophers and politicians exploit the importance of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by distorting its meaning for their own purposes. Therefore this verse warns that k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 should be recited by a person who is niv\u1e5btta-t\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b epitomizes the proper reciter for \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who purposefully left his kingdom and family prior to meeting death, epitomizes the person fit to hear it. A qualified reciter of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam gives the right medicine (bhavau\u1e63adhi) for the conditioned souls. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore trying to train qualified preachers to recite \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 throughout the entire world, so that people in general in all parts of the world may take advantage of this movement and thus be relieved of the threefold miseries of material existence. The instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and the descriptions of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam are so pleasing that almost anyone suffering from the threefold miseries of material existence will desire to hear the glories of the Lord from these books and thus benefit on the path of liberation. Two classes of men, however, will never be interested in hearing the message of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam \u2014 those who are determined to commit suicide and those determined to kill cows and other animals for the satisfaction of their own tongues. Although such persons may make a show of hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam at a Bh\u0101gavata-sapt\u0101ha, this is but another creation of the karm\u012bs, who cannot derive any benefit from such a performance. The word pa\u015bu-ghn\u0101t is important in this connection. Pa\u015bu-ghna means \u201cbutcher.\u201d Persons fond of performing ritualistic ceremonies for elevation to the higher planetary systems must offer sacrifices (yaj\u00f1as) by killing animals. Lord Buddhadeva therefore rejected the authority of the Vedas because his mission was to stop animal sacrifices, which are recommended in Vedic ritualistic ceremonies Even though animal sacrifices are sanctioned in Vedic ceremonies, men who kill animals for such ceremonies are considered butchers. Butchers cannot be interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for they are already materially allured. Their only interest lies in developing comforts for the temporary body. \u201cIn the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination of devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place.\u201d (Bg. 2.44) \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says: Anyone who is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and who therefore does not engage in the service of the Lord is also pa\u015bu-ghna, for he is willingly drinking poison. Such a person cannot be interested in k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 because he still has a desire for material sense gratification; he is not niv\u1e5btta-t\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As it is said, traivargik\u0101s te puru\u1e63\u0101 vimukh\u0101 hari-medhasa\u1e25. Those interested in trivarga \u2014 that is, in dharma, artha and k\u0101ma \u2014 are religious for the sake of achieving a material position with which to gain better facilities for sense gratification. Such persons are killing themselves by willingly keeping themselves in the cycle of birth and death. They cannot be interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, topics about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there must be a speaker and a hearer, both of whom can be interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness if they are no longer interested in material topics. One can actually see how this attitude automatically develops in persons who are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Although the devotees of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement are quite young men, they no longer read materialistic newspapers, magazines and so on, for they are no longer interested in such topics (niv\u1e5btta-tar\u1e63ai\u1e25). They completely give up the bodily understanding of life. For topics concerning Uttama\u015bloka, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual master speaks, and the disciple hears with attention. Unless both of them are free from material desires, they cannot be interested in topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The spiritual master and disciple do not need to understand anything more than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because simply by understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and talking about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one becomes a perfectly learned person (yasmin vij\u00f1\u0101te sarvam eva\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 bhavati, Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.3). The Lord sits within everyone\u2019s heart, and by the grace of the Lord the devotee receives instructions directly from the Lord Himself, who says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): \u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, I am to be known; indeed, I am the compiler of Ved\u0101nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so exalted that one who is perfectly situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, under the direction of the spiritual master, is fully satisfied by reading k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 as found in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and similar Vedic literatures. Since merely talking about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so pleasing, we can simply imagine how pleasing it is to render service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When discourses on k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 take place between a liberated spiritual master and his disciple, others also sometimes take advantage of hearing these topics and also benefit. These topics are the medicine to stop the repetition of birth and death. The cycle of repeated birth and death, by which one takes on different bodies again and again, is called bhava or bhava-roga. If anyone, willingly or unwillingly, hears k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, his bhava-roga, the disease of birth and death, will certainly stop. Therefore k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 is called bhavau\u1e63adha, the remedy to stop the repetition of birth and death. Karm\u012bs, or persons attached to material sense enjoyment, generally cannot give up their material desires, but k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 is such a potent medicine that if one is induced to hear k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-k\u012brtana, he will certainly be freed from this disease. A practical example is Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who at the end of his tapasya was fully satisfied. When the Lord wanted to give Dhruva a benediction, Dhruva refused it. Sv\u0101min k\u1e5bt\u0101rtho \u2019smi vara\u1e41 na y\u0101ce. \u201cMy dear Lord,\u201d he said, \u201cI am fully satisfied. I do not ask for any benediction for material sense gratification.\u201d We actually see that even young boys and girls in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement have given up their long practice of bad habits like illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so potent that it gives them full satisfaction, they are no longer interested in material sense gratification."

By the mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, my grandfathers crossed this ocean, which was very difficult to cross, as easily as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf. Because my mother surrendered unto Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet, the Lord, Sudar\u015bana-cakra in hand, entered her womb and saved my body, the body of the last remaining descendant of the Kurus and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, which was almost destroyed by the fiery weapon of A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appearing within and outside of all materially embodied living beings by His own potency in the forms of eternal time \u2014 that is, as Param\u0101tm\u0101 and as vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa \u2014 gave liberation to everyone, either as cruel death or as life. Kindly enlighten me by describing His transcendental characteristics.",
        "purport": " As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.58): \u201cFor one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mur\u0101ri, or the enemy of the Mura demon, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf\u2019s hoofprint. His goal is para\u1e41 padam, or Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, the place where there are no material miseries, not the place where there is danger at every step.\u201d One who seeks shelter at the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is immediately protected by the Lord. As the Lord promises in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66), aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25: \u201cI shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.\u201d By taking shelter of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one comes under the safest protection. Thus when the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas took shelter at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all of them were on the safe side of the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, therefore, felt obliged to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the last days of his life. This is the ideal result of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness: ante n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-sm\u1e5bti\u1e25. If at the time of death one can remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one\u2019s life is successful. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, therefore, because of his many obligations to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, intelligently decided to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constantly during the last days of his life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had saved the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it\u2019s grandfathers, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had saved Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it himself when he was attacked by the brahm\u0101stra of A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a acted as the friend and worshipable Deity of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava family. Moreover, apart from Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal contact with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supersoul of all living entities, and He gives everyone liberation, even if one is not a pure devotee. Ka\u1e41sa, for example, was not at all a devotee, yet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, after killing him, gave him salvation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is beneficial to everyone, whether one is a pure devotee or a nondevotee. This is the glory of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Considering this, who will not take shelter at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described in this verse as m\u0101y\u0101-manu\u1e63ya because He descends exactly like a human being. He is not obliged to come here, like karm\u012bs, or ordinary living beings; rather, He appears by His own internal energy (sambhav\u0101my \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101) just to show favor to the fallen conditioned souls. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always situated in His original position as sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, and anyone who renders service to Him is also situated in his original, spiritual identity (svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25). This is the highest perfection of human life."

        "purport": " To prepare to meet death in seven days, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it gave up all food and drink. As a human being, he was certainly both hungry and thirsty, and therefore \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b might have wanted to stop narrating the transcendental topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; but despite his fast, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was not at all fatigued. \u201cThe hunger and thirst from my fast do not disturb me,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce when I felt very thirsty, I went to the \u0101\u015brama of \u015aam\u012bka Muni to drink water, but the muni did not supply it. I therefore wrapped a dead snake over his shoulder, and that is why I was cursed by the br\u0101hma\u1e47a boy. Now, however, I am quite fit. I am not at all disturbed by my hunger and thirst.\u201d This indicates that although on the material platform there are disturbances from hunger and thirst, on the spiritual platform there is no such thing as fatigue. The entire world is suffering because of spiritual thirst. Every living being is Brahman, or spirit soul, and needs spiritual food to satisfy his hunger and thirst. Unfortunately, however, the world is completely unaware of the nectar of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore a boon to philosophers, religionists and people in general. There is certainly a charming attraction in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101. Therefore the Absolute Truth is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the most attractive. The word am\u1e5bta is also an important reference to the moon, and the word ambuja means \u201clotus.\u201d The pleasing moonshine and pleasing fragrance of the lotus combined to bring pleasure to everyone hearing k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 from the mouth of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. As it is said: \u201cBecause of their uncontrolled senses, persons too addicted to materialistic life make progress toward hellish conditions and repeatedly chew that which has already been chewed. Their inclinations toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are never aroused, either by the instructions of others, by their own efforts, or by a combination of both.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 7.5.30) At the present moment, all of human society is engaged in the business of chewing the chewed (puna\u1e25 puna\u015b carvita-carva\u1e47\u0101n\u0101m). People are prepared to undergo m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani, taking birth in one form, dying, accepting another form and dying again. To stop this repetition of birth and death, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is absolutely necessary. But unless one hears k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 from a realized soul like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, one cannot relish the nectar of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101, which puts an end to all material fatigue, and enjoy the blissful life of transcendental existence. In relation to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, we actually see that those who have tasted the nectar of k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 lose all material desires, whereas those who cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 regard the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious life as \u201cbrainwashing\u201d and \u201cmind control.\u201d While the devotees enjoy spiritual bliss, the nondevotees are surprised that the devotees have forgotten material hankerings."

It is said that in Kali-yuga people have only short lives, and they have no culture of spiritual consciousness.

Herein, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it has surrendered to the right personality, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, for enlightenment in v\u0101sudeva-kath\u0101. V\u0101sudeva is the original Personality of Godhead, who has unlimited spiritual activities. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is a record of such activities, and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the record of V\u0101sudeva speaking personally. Therefore, since the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is full of v\u0101sudeva-kath\u0101, anyone who hears, anyone who joins the movement and anyone who preaches will be purified."

        "translation": "Once when mother earth was overburdened by hundreds of thousands of military phalanxes of various conceited demons dressed like kings, she approached Lord Brahm\u0101 for relief.",
        "purport": " When the world is overburdened by unnecessary military arrangements and when various demoniac kings are the executive heads of state, this burden causes the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.7): \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I appear Myself.\u201d When the residents of this earth become atheistic and godless, they descend to the status of animals like dogs and hogs, and thus their only business is to bark among themselves. This is dharmasya gl\u0101ni, deviation from the goal of life. Human life is meant for attaining the highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but when people are godless and the presidents or kings are unnecessarily puffed up with military power, their business is to fight and increase the military strength of their different states. Nowadays, therefore, it appears that every state is busy manufacturing atomic weapons to prepare for a third world war. Such preparations are certainly unnecessary; they reflect the false pride of the heads of state. The real business of a chief executive is to see to the happiness of the mass of people by training them in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in different divisions of life. C\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25 (Bg. 4.13). A leader should train the people as br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras and engage them in various occupational duties, thus helping them progress toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Instead, however, rogues and thieves in the guise of protectors arrange for a voting system, and in the name of democracy they come to power by hook or crook and exploit the citizens. Even long, long ago, asuras, persons devoid of God consciousness, became the heads of state, and now this is happening again. The various states of the world are preoccupied with arranging for military strength. Sometimes they spend sixty-five percent of the government\u2019s revenue for this purpose. But why should people\u2019s hard-earned money be spent in this way? Because of the present world situation, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has descended in the form of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. This is quite natural, for without the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement the world cannot be peaceful and happy."

Modern science gives us telephones, by which one can hear sound vibrations from a distant place. Similarly, although other persons cannot hear the words of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lord Brahm\u0101 is able to hear the Lord\u2019s words within himself.

In the beginning of the creation, Lord Brahm\u0101 received the instructions of Vedic knowledge from Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u through the medium of the heart (h\u1e5bd\u0101).

Similarly, in the beginning, Brahm\u0101 first received the Vedic knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the core of the heart. In both instances the same process was used in transmitting the message to Lord Brahm\u0101. In other words, although Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u was invisible even to Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord Brahm\u0101 could hear Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s words through the heart.

This is certainly an act of His causeless mercy, but fools and nondevotees think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary historical person. Because they think that the Lord is an ordinary person like them, they are described as m\u016b\u1e0dha (avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25). The causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is neglected by such demoniac persons, who cannot understand the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and who therefore misinterpret them."

Without reference to the supreme power of the Personality of Godhead, demons assert themselves to be independent kings and presidents, and thus they create a disturbance by increasing their military power. When such disturbances are very prominent, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears. At present also, various demoniac states all over the world are increasing their military power in many ways, and the whole situation has become distressful. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has appeared by His name, in the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement, which will certainly diminish the burden of the world. Philosophers, religionists, and people in general must take to this movement very seriously, for man-made plans and devices will not help bring peace on earth. The transcendental sound Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not different from the person K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9) the Lord says, tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti: after giving up the material body, the devotee of the Lord returns home, back to Godhead. This means that the devotee is first transferred to the particular universe where the Lord is at that time staying to exhibit His pastimes. There are innumerable universes, and the Lord is appearing in one of these universes at every moment. Therefore His pastimes are called nitya-l\u012bl\u0101, eternal pastimes. The Lord\u2019s appearance as a child in the house of Devak\u012b takes place continuously in one universe after another. Therefore, the devotee is first transferred to that particular universe where the pastimes of the Lord are current. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, even if a devotee does not complete the course of devotional service, he enjoys the happiness of the heavenly planets, where the most pious people dwell, and then takes birth in the house of a \u015buci or \u015br\u012bm\u0101n, a pious br\u0101hma\u1e47a or a wealthy vai\u015bya (\u015buc\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 \u015br\u012bmat\u0101\u1e41 gehe yoga-bhra\u1e63\u1e6do\u00a0\u2019bhij\u0101yate). Thus a pure devotee, even if unable to execute devotional service completely, is transferred to the upper planetary system, where pious people reside. From there, if his devotional service is complete, such a devotee is transferred to the place where the Lord\u2019s pastimes are going on. Herein it is said, sambhavantu sura-striya\u1e25. Sura-str\u012b, the women of the heavenly planets, were thus ordered to appear in the Yadu dynasty in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to enrich the pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These sura-str\u012b, when further trained to live with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, would be transferred to the original Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. During Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes within this world, the sura-str\u012b were to appear in different ways in different families to give pleasure to the Lord, just so that they would be fully trained before going to the eternal Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. With the association of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, either at Dv\u0101rak\u0101-pur\u012b, Mathur\u0101-pur\u012b or V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, they would certainly return home, back to Godhead. Among the sura-str\u012b, the women of the heavenly planets, there are many devotees, such as the mother of the Upendra incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It was such devoted women who were called for in this connection."

In the Vedas it is said that the potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are called by different names, such as yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 and mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101. Ultimately, however, the Lord\u2019s potency is one, exactly as electric potency is one although it can act both to cool and to heat. The Lord\u2019s potency acts in both the spiritual and material worlds. In the spiritual world the Lord\u2019s potency works as yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, and in the material world the same potency works as mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, exactly as electricity works in both a heater and a cooler. In the material world, this potency, working as mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, acts upon the conditioned souls to deprive them more and more of devotional service. It is said, yay\u0101 sammohito j\u012bva \u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 tri-gu\u1e47\u0101tmakam. In the material world the conditioned soul thinks of himself as a product of tri-gu\u1e47a, the three modes of material nature. This is the bodily conception of life. Because of associating with the three gu\u1e47as of the material potency, everyone identifies himself with his body. Someone is thinking he is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, someone a k\u1e63atriya, and someone a vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra. Actually, however, one is neither a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a k\u1e63atriya, a vai\u015bya nor a \u015b\u016bdra; one is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25), but because of being covered by the material energy, mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, one identifies himself in these different ways. When the conditioned soul becomes liberated, however, he thinks himself an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. J\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa.\u2019 When he comes to that position, the same potency, acting as yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, increasingly helps him become purified and devote his energy to the service of the Lord. In either case, whether the soul is conditioned or liberated, the Lord is supreme. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10), may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram: it is by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the material energy, mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, works upon the conditioned soul. \u201cThe bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities which are in actuality carried out by nature.\u201d (Bg. 3.27) Within conditioned life, no one has freedom, but because one is bewildered, being subject to the rule of mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, one foolishly thinks himself independent (aha\u1e45k\u0101ra-vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101tm\u0101 kart\u0101ham iti manyate). But when the conditioned soul becomes liberated by executing devotional service, he is given a greater and greater chance to relish a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in different transcendental statuses, such as d\u0101sya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, v\u0101tsalya-rasa and m\u0101dhurya-rasa. Thus the Lord\u2019s potency, vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u0101y\u0101, has two features: \u0101vara\u1e47ik\u0101 and unmukha. When the Lord appeared, His potency came with Him and acted in different ways. She acted as Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 with Ya\u015bod\u0101, Devak\u012b and other intimate relations of the Lord, and she acted in a different way with Ka\u1e41sa, \u015a\u0101lva and other asuras. By the order of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, His potency Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 came with Him and exhibited different activities according to the time and circumstances (k\u0101ry\u0101rthe sambhavi\u1e63yati). Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 acted differently to execute different purposes desired by the Lord. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.13), mah\u0101tm\u0101nas tu m\u0101\u1e41 p\u0101rtha daiv\u012b\u1e41 prak\u1e5btim \u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25. The mah\u0101tm\u0101s, who fully surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, are directed by Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, whereas the dur\u0101tm\u0101s, those who are devoid of devotional service, are directed by Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101."

        "purport": " It is understood that Mathur\u0101 City is the transcendental abode of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; it is not an ordinary material city, for it is eternally connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is within the jurisdiction of Mathur\u0101, and it still continues to exist. Because Mathur\u0101 and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are intimately connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a eternally, it is said that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never leaves V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana (v\u1e5bnd\u0101vana\u1e41 parityajya padam eka\u1e41 na gacchati). At present, the place known as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, in the district of Mathur\u0101, continues its position as a transcendental place, and certainly anyone who goes there becomes transcendentally purified. Navadv\u012bpa-dh\u0101ma is also intimately connected with Vrajabh\u016bmi. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore says: \u201cVrajabh\u016bmi\u201d refers to Mathur\u0101-V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and Gau\u1e0da-ma\u1e47\u1e0dala-bh\u016bmi includes Navadv\u012bpa. These two places are nondifferent. Therefore, anyone living in Navadv\u012bpa-dh\u0101ma, knowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu to be the same personality, lives in Vrajabh\u016bmi, Mathur\u0101-V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. The Lord has made it convenient for the conditioned soul to live in Mathur\u0101, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and Navadv\u012bpa and thus be directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Simply by living in these places, one can immediately come in contact with the Lord. There are many devotees who vow never to leave V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and Mathur\u0101. This is undoubtedly a good vow, but if one leaves V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Mathur\u0101 or Navadv\u012bpa-dh\u0101ma for the service of the Lord, he is not disconnected from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At any rate, we must understand the transcendental importance of Mathur\u0101-V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and Navadv\u012bpa-dh\u0101ma. Anyone who executes devotional service in these places certainly goes back home, back to Godhead, after giving up his body. Thus the words mathur\u0101 bhagav\u0101n yatra nitya\u1e41 sannihito hari\u1e25 are particularly important. A devotee should fully utilize this instruction to the best of his ability. Whenever the Supreme Lord personally appears, He appears in Mathur\u0101 because of His intimate connection with this place. Therefore although Mathur\u0101 and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are situated on this planet earth, they are transcendental abodes of the Lord."

Therefore, while she and her husband were leaving home, he gave her a dowry of four hundred elephants nicely decorated with golden garlands. He also gave ten thousand horses, eighteen hundred chariots, and two hundred very beautiful young maidservants, fully decorated with ornaments.",
        "purport": " The system of giving a dowry to one\u2019s daughter has existed in Vedic civilization for a very long time. Even today, following the same system, a father who has money will give his daughter an opulent dowry. A daughter would never inherit the property of her father, and therefore an affectionate father, during the marriage of his daughter, would give her as much as possible. A dowry, therefore, is never illegal according to the Vedic system. Here, of course, the gift offered as a dowry by Devaka to Devak\u012b was not ordinary. Because Devaka was a king, he gave a dowry quite suitable to his royal position. Even an ordinary man, especially a high-class br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya or vai\u015bya, is supposed to give his daughter a liberal dowry. Immediately after the marriage, the daughter goes to her husband\u2019s house, and it is also a custom for the brother of the bride to accompany his sister and brother-in-law to exhibit affection for her. This system was followed by Ka\u1e41sa. These are all old customs in the society of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, which is now wrongly designated as Hindu. These long-standing customs are nicely described here."

According to the Vi\u015bva-ko\u015ba dictionary, the word garbha means \u201cembryo\u201d and also arbhaka, or \u201cchild.\u201d Ka\u1e41sa was affectionate toward his sister, and therefore he had become the chariot driver to carry her and his brother-in-law to their home. The demigods, however, did not want Ka\u1e41sa to be affectionate toward Devak\u012b, and therefore, from an unseen position, they encouraged Ka\u1e41sa to offend her. Moreover, the six sons of Mar\u012bci had been cursed to take birth from the womb of Devak\u012b, and upon being killed by Ka\u1e41sa they would be delivered. When Devak\u012b understood that Ka\u1e41sa would be killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who would appear from her womb, she felt great joy. The word vahase is also significant because it indicates that the ominous vibration condemned Ka\u1e41sa for acting just like a beast of burden by carrying his enemy\u2019s mother."

Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament.\u201d One should not fear death. Rather, one should prepare oneself for the next birth. One should utilize one\u2019s time in this human form to end the process of birth and death. It is not that to save oneself from death one should entangle oneself in sinful activities.

When the next body is obtained, he gives up the present body.",
        "purport": " This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which presents the beginning of spiritual understanding. \u201cAs the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d (Bg. 2.13) A person or an animal is not the material body; rather, the material body is the covering of the living being. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 compares the body to a dress and elaborately explains how one changes dresses one after another. The same Vedic knowledge is confirmed here. The living being, the soul, is constantly changing bodies one after another. Even in the present life, the body changes from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youth, and from youth to old age; similarly, when the body is too old to continue, the living being gives up this body and, by the laws of nature, automatically gets another body according to his fruitive activities, desires and ambitions. The laws of nature control this sequence, and therefore as long as the living entity is under the control of the external, material energy, the process of bodily change takes place automatically, according to one\u2019s fruitive activities. Vasudeva therefore wanted to impress upon Ka\u1e41sa that if he committed this sinful act of killing a woman, in his next life he would certainly get a material body still more conditioned to the sufferings of material existence. Thus Vasudeva advised Ka\u1e41sa not to commit sinful activities. One who commits sinful activities because of ignorance, tamo-gu\u1e47a, obtains a lower body. K\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go\u00a0\u2019sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu (Bg. 13.22). There are hundreds and thousands of different species of life. Why are there higher and lower bodies? One receives these bodies according to the contaminations of material nature. If in this life one is contaminated by the mode of ignorance and sinful activities (du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b), in the next life, by the laws of nature, one will certainly get a body full of suffering. The laws of nature are not subservient to the whimsical desires of the conditioned soul. Our endeavor, therefore, should be to associate always with sattva-gu\u1e47a and not indulge in rajo-gu\u1e47a or tamo-gu\u1e47a (rajas-tamo-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25). Lusty desires and greed keep the living entity perpetually in ignorance and prevent him from being elevated to the platform of sattva-gu\u1e47a or \u015buddha-sattva-gu\u1e47a. One is advised to be situated in \u015buddha-sattva-gu\u1e47a, devotional service, for thus one is immune to the reactions of the three modes of material nature."

Dull-minded persons who do not have the intelligence to understand this process of transmigration take for granted that when the gross body is finished, one\u2019s life is finished forever. Such persons have no brains with which to understand the process of transmigration. At the present moment there is great opposition to the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement, which is being called a \u201cbrainwashing\u201d movement. But actually the so-called scientists, philosophers and other leaders in the Western countries have no brains at all. The Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement is trying to elevate such foolish persons by enlightening their intelligence so that they will take advantage of the human body. Unfortunately, because of gross ignorance, they regard the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement as a brainwashing movement. They do not know that without God consciousness one is forced to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Because of their devilish brains, they will next be forced to accept an abominable life and practically never be able to liberate themselves from the conditional life of material existence.

        "translation": "Having experienced a situation by seeing or hearing about it, one contemplates and speculates about that situation, and thus one surrenders to it, not considering his present body. Similarly, by mental adjustments one dreams at night of living under different circumstances, in different bodies, and forgets his actual position. Under this same process, one gives up his present body and accepts another [tath\u0101 deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101pti\u1e25].",
        "purport": " Transmigration of the soul is very clearly explained in this verse. One sometimes forgets his present body and thinks of his childhood body, a body of the past, and of how one was playing, jumping, talking and so on. When the material body is no longer workable, it becomes dust: \u201cFor dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\u201d But when the body again mixes with the five material elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air and ether \u2014 the mind continues to work. The mind is the subtle substance in which the body is created, as we actually experience in our dreams and also when we are awake in contemplation. One must understand that the process of mental speculation develops a new type of body that does not actually exist. If one can understand the nature of the mind (manorathena) and its thinking, feeling and willing, one can very easily understand how from the mind different types of bodies develop. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, therefore, offers a process of transcendental activities wherein the mind is fully absorbed in affairs pertaining to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The presence of the soul is perceived by consciousness, and one must purify his consciousness from material to spiritual, or, in other words, to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That which is spiritual is eternal, and that which is material is temporary. Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one\u2019s consciousness is always absorbed in temporary things. For everyone, therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.34), man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru. One should always be absorbed in thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one should become His devotee, one should always engage in His service and worship Him as the supreme great, and one should always offer Him obeisances. In the material world one is always a servant of a greater person, and in the spiritual world our constitutional position is to serve the Supreme, the greatest, para\u1e41 brahma. This is the instruction of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. J\u012bvera \u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa\u2019 (Cc. Madhya 20.108). To act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the perfection of life and the highest perfection of yoga. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.47): \u201cOf all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\u201d The condition of the mind, which flickers between sa\u1e45kalpa and vikalpa, accepting something and rejecting it, is very important in transferring the soul to another material body at the time of death. \u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.\u201d (Bg. 8.6) Therefore one must train the mind in the system of bhakti-yoga, as did Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, who kept himself always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25. One must fix the mind at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day. If the mind is fixed upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet, the activities of the other senses will be engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate: to serve H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the master of the senses, with purified senses is called bhakti. Those who constantly engage in devotional service are situated in a transcendental state, above the material modes of nature. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d One must learn the secret of success from the Vedic literatures, especially when the cream of Vedic knowledge is presented by Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is. Because the mind is ultimately controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the word apasm\u1e5bti\u1e25 is significant. Forgetfulness of one\u2019s own identity is called apasm\u1e5bti\u1e25. This apasm\u1e5bti\u1e25 can be controlled by the Supreme Lord, for the Lord says, matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca: \u201cFrom Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\u201d Instead of allowing one to forget one\u2019s real position, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can revive one\u2019s original identity at the time of one\u2019s death, even though the mind may be flickering. Although the mind may work imperfectly at the time of death, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives a devotee shelter at His lotus feet. Therefore when a devotee gives up his body, the mind does not take him to another material body (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti); rather, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a takes the devotee to that place where He is engaged in His pastimes (m\u0101m eti), as we have already discussed in previous verses. One\u2019s consciousness, therefore, must always be absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and then one\u2019s life will be successful. Otherwise the mind will carry the soul to another material body. The soul will be placed in the semen of a father and discharged into the womb of a mother. The semen and ovum create a particular type of body according to the form of the father and mother, and when the body is mature, the soul emerges in that body and begins a new life. This is the process of transmigration of the soul from one body to another (tath\u0101 deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101pti\u1e25). Unfortunately, those who are less intelligent think that when the body disappears, everything is finished. The entire world is being misled by such fools and rascals. But as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.20), na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre. The soul does not die when the body is destroyed. Rather, the soul takes on another body."

        "translation": "At the time of death, according to the thinking, feeling and willing of the mind, which is involved in fruitive activities, one receives a particular body. In other words, the body develops according to the activities of the mind. Changes of body are due to the flickering of the mind, for otherwise the soul could remain in its original, spiritual body.",
        "purport": " One can very easily understand that the mind is constantly flickering, changing in the quality of its thinking, feeling and willing. This is explained by Arjuna in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.34): The mind is ca\u00f1cala, flickering, and it changes very strongly. Therefore Arjuna admitted that controlling the mind is not at all possible; this would be as difficult as controlling the wind. For example, if one were in a boat moving according to the wind on a river or the sea, and the wind were uncontrollable, the tilting boat would be very much disturbed and extremely difficult to control. It might even capsize. Therefore, in the bhava-samudra, the ocean of mental speculation and transmigration to different types of bodies, one must first control the mind. By regulative practice one can control the mind, and this is the purpose of the yoga system (abhy\u0101sa-yoga-yuktena). But there is a chance of failure with the yoga system, especially in this Age of Kali, because the yoga system uses artificial means. If the mind is engaged in bhakti-yoga, however, by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one can very easily control it. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has recommended, harer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101maiva kevalam. One should chant the holy name of the Lord constantly, for the holy name of the Lord is nondifferent from Hari, the Supreme Person. By chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra constantly, one can fix the mind on the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25) and in this way achieve the perfection of yoga. Otherwise, the flickering mind will hover on the platform of mental speculation for sense enjoyment, and one will have to transmigrate from one type of body to another because the mind is trained only in relation to the material elements, or, in other words, to sense gratification, which is false. M\u0101y\u0101-sukh\u0101ya bharam udvahato vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101n (Bh\u0101g. 7.9.43). Rascals (vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101n), being controlled by mental speculation, make huge arrangements by which to enjoy life temporarily, but they must give up the body at the time of death, when everything is taken away by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s external energy (m\u1e5btyu\u1e25 sarva-hara\u015b c\u0101ham). At that time, whatever one has created in this life is lost, and one must automatically accept a new body by the force of material nature. In this life one may have constructed a very tall skyscraper, but in the next life, because of one\u2019s mentality, one may have to accept a body like that of a cat, a dog, a tree or perhaps a demigod. Thus the body is offered by the laws of material nature. K\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go\u00a0\u2019sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu (Bg. 13.22). The spirit soul takes birth in higher and lower species of life only because of his association with the three qualities of material nature. \u201cThose situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.\u201d (Bg. 14.18) In conclusion, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement offers the topmost welfare activity for human society. The saner section of human society must therefore take this movement very seriously for the benefit of all humanity. To save oneself from the repetition of birth and death, one must purify his consciousness. Sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41 tat-paratvena nirmalam. One must be freed from all designations \u2014 \u201cI am American,\u201d \u201cI am Indian,\u201d \u201cI am this,\u201d \u201cI am that\u201d \u2014 and come to the platform of understanding that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original master and we are His eternal servants. When the senses are purified and engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, one achieves the highest perfection. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is a movement of bhakti-yoga. Vair\u0101gya-vidy\u0101-nija-bhakti-yoga. By following the principles of this movement, one becomes disassociated from material mental concoctions and is established on the original platform of the eternal relationship between the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead as servant and master. This, in summary, is the purpose of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement."

        "translation": "When the luminaries in the sky, such as the moon, the sun and the stars, are reflected in liquids like oil or water, they appear to be of different shapes \u2014 sometimes round, sometimes long, and so on \u2014 because of the movements of the wind. Similarly, when the living entity, the soul, is absorbed in materialistic thoughts, he accepts various manifestations as his own identity because of ignorance. In other words, one is bewildered by mental concoctions because of agitation from the material modes of nature.",
        "purport": " This verse gives a very good example by which to understand the different positions of the eternal spiritual soul in the material world and how the soul takes on different bodies (deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101pti\u1e25). The moon is stationary and is one, but when it is reflected in water or oil, it appears to take different shapes because of the movements of the wind. Similarly, the soul is the eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when put into the material modes of nature, it takes different bodies, sometimes as a demigod, sometimes a man, a dog, a tree and so on. By the influence of m\u0101y\u0101, the illusory potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity thinks that he is this person, that person, American, Indian, cat, dog, tree or whatever. This is called m\u0101y\u0101. When one is freed from this bewilderment and understands that the soul does not belong to any shape of this material world, one is situated on the spiritual platform (brahma-bh\u016bta). This realization is sometimes explained as nir\u0101k\u0101ra, or formlessness. This formlessness, however, does not mean that the soul has no form. The soul has form, but the external, agitating form he has acquired because of material contamination is false. Similarly, God is also described as nir\u0101k\u0101ra, which means that God has no material form but is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. The living entity is part and parcel of the supreme sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, but his material forms are temporary, or illusory. Both the living entity and the Supreme Lord have original, spiritual forms (sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha), but the Lord, the Supreme, does not change His form. The Lord appears as He is, whereas the living entity appears because material nature forces him to accept different forms. When the living entity receives these different forms, he identifies with them, and not with his original, spiritual form. As soon as the living entity returns to his original, spiritual form and understanding, he immediately surrenders to the supreme form, the Personality of Godhead. This is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19). Bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate. When the living entity, after many, many births in different forms, returns to his original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he immediately surrenders unto the lotus feet of the supreme form, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is liberation. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): \u201cOne who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\u201d Surrender unto the supreme form is the result of bhakti. This bhakti, or understanding of one\u2019s own position, is the complete liberation. As long as one is under an impersonal understanding of the Absolute Truth, he is not in pure knowledge, but must still struggle for pure knowledge. Kle\u015bo\u00a0\u2019dhikataras te\u1e63\u0101m avyakt\u0101sakta-cetas\u0101m (Bg. 12.5). Although one may be spiritually advanced, if one is attached to the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth one must still work very hard, as indicated by the words kle\u015bo\u00a0\u2019dhikatara\u1e25, which mean \u201cgreater suffering.\u201d A devotee, however, easily attains his original position as a spiritual form and understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself explains the forms of the living entities in the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, where He clearly says to Arjuna that He, Arjuna and all other living entities, who were previously in their original forms, are separate individual identities. They were individuals in the past, they are now situated in individuality, and in the future they will all continue to maintain their individual forms. The only difference is that the conditioned living entity appears in various material forms, whereas K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in His original, spiritual form. Unfortunately, those who are not advanced in spiritual knowledge think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is like one of them and that His form is like their material forms. Avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam (Bg. 9.11). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is never puffed up by material knowledge and is therefore called acyuta, whereas the living entities fall down and are agitated by material nature. This is the difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entities. In this connection it is to be noted that Vasudeva, who was situated in a transcendental position, advised Ka\u1e41sa not to commit further sinful activities. Ka\u1e41sa, a representative of the demons, was always ready to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God, whereas Vasudeva represents a transcendentally situated person to whom K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is born (V\u0101sudeva is the son of Vasudeva). Vasudeva wanted his brother-in-law Ka\u1e41sa to refrain from the sinful act of killing his sister, since the result of being agitated by material nature would be that Ka\u1e41sa would have to accept a body in which to suffer again and again. Elsewhere in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.4), \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva also says: As long as the living entity is entangled in the fruitive activities of so-called happiness and distress, he will receive a particular type of body in which to endure the three kinds of suffering due to material nature (tri-t\u0101pa-yantra\u1e47\u0101). An intelligent person, therefore, must free himself from the influence of the three modes of material nature and revive his original, spiritual body by engaging in the service of the Supreme Person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As long as one is materially attached, one must accept the process of birth, death, old age and disease. One is therefore advised that an intelligent person, instead of being entangled in so-called good and bad fruitive activities, should engage his life in advancing in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that instead of accepting another material body (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti), he will return home, back to Godhead."

Although all the events were prearranged by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, a devotee must try his best to serve the purpose of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself is all-powerful, but it is not that a devotee should therefore sit idly and leave everything to Him. This instruction is also found in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was doing everything for Arjuna, Arjuna never sat down idly as a nonviolent gentleman. Rather, he tried his best to fight the battle and be victorious."

By the grace of the guru, the spiritual master, one can understand the different kinds of devas. The word deva refers to God, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the original source of all the demigods, who are also called devas. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.2) the Lord says, aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m: \u201cI am the source of all the devas.\u201d The Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Original Person, expands in different forms. Tad aik\u1e63ata bahu sy\u0101m (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 6.2.3). He alone has expanded into many. Advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.33). There are different grades of forms, known as sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba and vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba. The sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba expansions, or vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba are j\u012bva-tattva, who are part and parcel of the Lord (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25).

By worshiping Acyuta, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one automatically worships all the demigods. There is no need of separately worshiping either the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva or j\u012bva-tattva. If one concentrates upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one worships everyone. Therefore, because mother Devak\u012b gave birth to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, she is described here as sarva-devat\u0101."

The answer is that Vasudeva had promised Ka\u1e41sa that he would deliver all the children born of Devak\u012b. Ka\u1e41sa, being an asura, did not believe that the eighth child would kill him; he took it for granted that he might be killed by any of the children of Devak\u012b. Vasudeva, therefore, to save Devak\u012b, promised to give Ka\u1e41sa every child, whether male or female. From another point of view, Vasudeva and Devak\u012b were very pleased when they understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, would come as their eighth son. Vasudeva, a pure devotee of the Lord, was eager to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appear as his child from the eighth pregnancy of Devak\u012b. Therefore he wanted to deliver all the children quickly so that the eighth turn would come and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would appear. He begot one child every year so that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s turn to appear would come as soon as possible."

        "purport": " The word samatvam is very significant in this verse. Samatvam refers to one who is always equipoised, unaffected by either happiness or distress. Vasudeva was so steadily equipoised that he did not seem in the least agitated when delivering his first-born child into the hands of Ka\u1e41sa to be killed. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.56) it is said, du\u1e25khe\u1e63v anudvigna-man\u0101\u1e25 sukhe\u1e63u vigata-sp\u1e5bha\u1e25. In the material world, one should not be very eager to be happy, nor should one be very much disturbed by material distress. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advised Arjuna: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\u201d (Bg. 2.14) The self-realized soul is never disturbed by so-called distress or happiness, and this is especially true of an exalted devotee like Vasudeva, who showed this by his practical example. Vasudeva was not at all disturbed when delivering his first child to Ka\u1e41sa to be killed."

The Lord ordered all the denizens of the heavenly planets to take birth in different families of the Yadu and V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i dynasties and in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Now this verse informs us that all the family and friends of the Yadu dynasty, the V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i dynasty, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and the gopas descended from the heavenly planets to see the pastimes of the Lord. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.8), the Lord\u2019s pastimes consist of paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m \u2014 saving the devotees and killing the demons. To demonstrate these activities, the Lord called for devotees from different parts of the universe. There are many devotees who are elevated to the higher planetary systems. \u201cThe unsuccessful yog\u012b, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a family of rich aristocracy.\u201d (Bg. 6.41) Some devotees, having failed to complete the process of devotional service, are promoted to the heavenly planets, to which the pious are elevated, and after enjoying there they may be directly promoted to the place where the Lord\u2019s pastimes are going on. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was to appear, the denizens of the heavenly planets were invited to see the pastimes of the Lord, and thus it is stated here that the members of the Yadu and V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i dynasties and the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana were demigods or almost as good as demigods. Even those who externally helped the activities of Ka\u1e41sa belonged to the higher planetary systems. The imprisonment and release of Vasudeva and the killing of various demons were all manifestations of the pastimes of the Lord, and because the devotees would be pleased to see these activities personally, they were all invited to take birth as friends and relatives of these families. As confirmed in the prayers of Kunt\u012b (Bh\u0101g. 1.8.19), nato n\u0101\u1e6dya-dharo yath\u0101. The Lord was to play the part of a demon-killer, and a friend, son and brother to His devotees, and thus these devotees were all summoned."

        "purport": " It has already been discussed that mother earth implored Lord Brahm\u0101 to give her relief from the distress created by the burdensome demons and that Lord Brahm\u0101 informed her that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself was going to appear. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.8): Whenever there is a burden created by the demons and whenever the innocent devotees are distressed by demoniac rulers, the Lord appears in due course of time to kill the demons with the assistance of His real representatives, who are technically called demigods. In the Upani\u1e63ads it is stated that the demigods are different parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is the duty of the parts of the body to serve the whole, it is the duty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He wants. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s business is to kill the demons, and therefore this should be a devotee\u2019s business also. Because the people of Kali-yuga are fallen, however, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, out of kindness for them, did not bring any weapon to kill them. Rather, by spreading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He wanted to kill their nefarious, demoniac activities. This is the purpose of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Unless the demoniac activities on the surface of the world are diminished or vanquished, no one can be happy. The program for the conditioned soul is fully described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and one simply has to follow these instructions to become happy. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has therefore prescribed: Let people chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra constantly. Then their demoniac tendencies will be killed, and they will become first-class devotees, happy in this life and in the next."

Fearing his death, Ka\u1e41sa arrested Vasudeva and Devak\u012b and chained them with iron shackles. Suspecting each of the children to be Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Ka\u1e41sa killed them one after another because of the prophecy that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u would kill him.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, in his notes on this verse, has mentioned how N\u0101rada Muni gave Ka\u1e41sa this information. This incident is described in the Hari-va\u1e41\u015ba. N\u0101rada Muni went to see Ka\u1e41sa by providence, and Ka\u1e41sa received him very well. N\u0101rada, therefore, informed him that any one of the sons of Devak\u012b might be Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Because Vi\u1e63\u1e47u was to kill him, Ka\u1e41sa should not spare any of Devak\u012b\u2019s children, N\u0101rada Muni advised. N\u0101rada\u2019s intention was that Ka\u1e41sa, by killing the children, would increase his sinful activities so that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would soon appear to kill him. Upon receiving the instructions of N\u0101rada Muni, Ka\u1e41sa killed all the children of Devak\u012b one after another. The word ajana-\u015ba\u1e45kay\u0101 indicates that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u never takes birth (ajana) and that He therefore appeared as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, taking birth just like a human being (m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam). Ka\u1e41sa attempted to kill all the babies born of Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, although he knew that if Vi\u1e63\u1e47u were born, He would not be killed. Actually it came to pass that when Vi\u1e63\u1e47u appeared as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Ka\u1e41sa could not kill Him; rather, as foretold, it was He who killed Ka\u1e41sa. One should know in truth how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who takes His birth transcendentally, acts to kill the demons but is never killed. When one perfectly understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this way, through the medium of \u015b\u0101stra, one becomes immortal. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d"

For demons to do such things is not astonishing. Nonetheless, although Ka\u1e41sa was a demon, he was aware that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u cannot be killed, and thus he attained salvation. Even partial understanding of the activities of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u makes one eligible for salvation. Ka\u1e41sa knew a little about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 that He could not be killed \u2014 and therefore he attained salvation although he thought of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as an enemy.

Regarding transmigration of the soul, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya gives the following notes. When one is awake, whatever one sees or hears is impressed upon the mind, which later works in dreams to show one different experiences, although in dreams one appears to accept a different body. For example, when one is awake one does business and talks with customers, and similarly in dreams one meets various customers, talks about business and gives quotations. Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says, therefore, that dreams take place according to what one sees, hears and remembers. When one reawakens, of course, one forgets the body of the dream. This forgetfulness is called apasm\u1e5bti. Thus we are changing bodies because we are sometimes dreaming, sometimes awake and sometimes forgetful. Forgetfulness of our previously created body is called death, and our work in the present body is called life. After death, one cannot remember the activities of one\u2019s previous body, whether imaginary or factual. The agitated mind is compared to agitated water reflecting the sun and the moon. Actually the sun and moon reflected on the water do not exist there; nonetheless, they are reflected according to the movements of the water. Similarly, when our minds are agitated, we wander in different material atmospheres and receive different types of bodies. This is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45ga. K\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go\u00a0\u2019sya. Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says, gu\u1e47a-nubaddha\u1e25 san. And \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says, brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da bhramite kona bh\u0101gyav\u0101n j\u012bva (Cc. Madhya 19.151). The living entity rotates up and down throughout the universe, sometimes in the upper planetary system, sometimes in the middle and lower planetary systems, sometimes as a man, sometimes a god, a dog, a tree and so on. This is all due to the agitation of the mind. The mind must therefore be steadily fixed. As it is said, sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25. One should fix one\u2019s mind at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and then one will become free from agitation. This is the instruction of the Garu\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a, and in the N\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a the same process is described. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n. The agitated mind goes to different planetary systems because it is attached to different kinds of demigods, but one does not go to the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by worshiping the demigods, for this is not supported by any Vedic literature. Man is the architect of his own fortune. In this human life one has the facility with which to understand one\u2019s real situation, and one can decide whether to wander around the universe forever or return home, back to Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (apr\u0101pya m\u0101\u1e41 nivartante m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani). There is no such thing as chance. When a tree is burning in a forest fire and although the nearest tree is spared a distant tree catches fire, this may appear to be chance. Similarly, one may seem to get different types of bodies by chance, but actually one receives these bodies because of the mind. The mind flickers between accepting and rejecting, and according to the acceptance and rejection of the mind, we receive different types of bodies, although we superficially seem to obtain these bodies by chance. Even if we accept the theory of chance, the immediate cause for the change of body is the agitation of the mind. Notes on a\u1e41\u015ba. This chapter describes that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared a\u1e41\u015bena, with His parts and parcels or His partial manifestation. In this connection, \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b says that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is one hundred percent Bhagav\u0101n (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam). Because of our imperfections, however, we cannot appreciate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in fullness, and therefore whatever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibited when present on earth was but a partial manifestation of His opulence. Again, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared with His plenary expansion Baladeva. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, is full; there is no question of His appearing partially. In the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b, \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that to accept that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was partially manifested would contradict the statement k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that the word a\u1e41\u015bena means that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared with all His plenary expansions. The words a\u1e41\u015bena vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 do not mean that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a partial representative of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Rather, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared in fullness, and He manifests Himself partially in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas. In other words, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is a partial representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not a partial representation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101, Chapter Four, this subject matter is explained very clearly. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also notes that no one can describe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in fullness. Whatever descriptions we find in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam are partial explanations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In conclusion, therefore, the word a\u1e41\u015bena indicates that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is a partial representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a partial representation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b has explained the word dharma-\u015b\u012blasya. The exact meaning of dharma-\u015b\u012bla is \u201can unadulterated devotee.\u201d Real dharma consists of full surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). One who has fully surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually religious. One such religious person was Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it. Anyone who accepts the principle of surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, giving up all other systems of religion, is actually dharma-\u015b\u012bla, perfectly religious. The word niv\u1e5btta-tar\u1e63ai\u1e25 refers to one who no longer has any material desires (sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmuktam). One may have many material desires because of contamination in this material world, but when one is completely free from all material desires, he is called niv\u1e5btta-t\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which indicates that he no longer has any thirst for material enjoyment. Sv\u0101min k\u1e5bt\u0101rtho\u00a0\u2019smi vara\u1e41 na y\u0101ce (Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya). Materialistic persons want some material profit from executing devotional service, but this is not the purpose of service. The perfection of devotional service lies in complete surrender unto the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, with no material desires. One who surrenders in this way is already liberated. J\u012bvan-mukta\u1e25 sa ucyate. One who is always busy serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in whatever condition he may live, is understood to be liberated even in this life. Such a person, who is a pure devotee, does not need to change his body; indeed, he does not possess a material body, for his body has already been spiritualized. An iron rod kept constantly within a fire will ultimately become fire, and whatever it touches will burn. Similarly, the pure devotee is in the fire of spiritual existence, and therefore his body is cin-maya; that is, it is spiritual, not material, because the pure devotee has no desire but the transcendental desire to serve the Lord. In text four the word upag\u012byam\u0101n\u0101t is used: niv\u1e5btta-tar\u1e63air upag\u012byam\u0101n\u0101t. Who will chant the glories of the Lord unless he is a devotee? Therefore the word niv\u1e5btta-tar\u1e63ai\u1e25 indicates the devotee, and no one else. These are the remarks of \u0101c\u0101ryas like V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya and Vijayadhvaja. To desire anything other than devotional service will diminish one\u2019s freedom from material desires, but when one is free from all such desires one is called niv\u1e5btta-tar\u1e63ai\u1e25. Vin\u0101 pa\u015bu-ghn\u0101t. The word pa\u015bu means \u201canimal.\u201d An animal killer, pa\u015bu-ghna, cannot enter into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, therefore, animal killing is completely prohibited. Uttama\u015bloka-gu\u1e47\u0101nuv\u0101d\u0101t. The word uttama\u015bloka means \u201cone who is famous as the best of those who are good.\u201d The Lord is good in all circumstances. That is His natural reputation. His goodness is unlimited, and He uses it unlimitedly. A devotee is also sometimes described as uttama\u015bloka, meaning that he is eager to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the Lord\u2019s devotees. Glorifying the Lord and glorifying the Lord\u2019s devotees are the same. Or, rather, glorifying the devotee is more important than glorifying the Lord directly. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains this fact: ch\u0101\u1e0diy\u0101 vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-sev\u0101, nist\u0101ra p\u0101yeche keb\u0101. One cannot be liberated from material contamination without sincerely serving a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Bhavau\u1e63adh\u0101t means \u201cfrom the universal remedy.\u201d Chanting the holy name and glorifying the Supreme Lord are the universal remedy for all the miseries of materialistic life. Persons who desire to be freed from this material world are called mumuk\u1e63u. Such persons can understand the miseries of materialistic life, and by glorifying the activities of the Lord they can be released from all these miseries. The transcendental sound vibrations concerning the Lord\u2019s name, fame, form, qualities and paraphernalia are all nondifferent from the Lord. Therefore the very sound vibration of the Lord\u2019s glorification and name are pleasing to the ears, and by understanding the absolute nature of the Lord\u2019s name, form and qualities the devotee becomes joyful. Even those who are not devotees, however, enjoy the pleasing narrations of the Lord\u2019s transcendental activities. Even ordinary persons not very much advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness take pleasure in describing the narrations depicted in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. When a materialistic person is purified in this way, he engages in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. Because glorification of the Lord\u2019s pastimes is very pleasing to the ear and heart of the devotee, it is simultaneously his subject and object. In this world there are three kinds of men: those who are liberated, those trying to be liberated, and those entangled in sense enjoyment. Of these three, those who are already liberated chant and hear the holy name of the Lord, knowing perfectly that to glorify the Lord is the only way to keep oneself in a transcendental position. Those who are trying to be liberated, the second class, may regard the chanting and hearing of the Lord\u2019s holy name as a process of liberation, and they too will feel the transcendental pleasure of this chanting. As for karm\u012bs and persons engaged in sense gratification, they also may take pleasure in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, like His fighting on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra and His dancing in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana with the gop\u012bs. The word uttama\u015bloka-gu\u1e47\u0101nuv\u0101da refers to the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord, such as His affection for mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and His friends the cowherd boys and His loving attitude toward the gop\u012bs. The Lord\u2019s devotees like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira are also described by the qualification uttama\u015bloka-gu\u1e47\u0101nuv\u0101da. The word anuv\u0101da refers to describing the qualities of the Supreme Lord or His devotees. When these qualities are described, other devotees are interested in hearing them. The more one is interested in hearing about these transcendental qualities, the more one transcendentally enjoys. Everyone, therefore, including the mumuk\u1e63us, the vimuktas and the karm\u012bs, should chant and hear the glories of the Lord, and in this way everyone will benefit. Although the sound vibration of the transcendental qualities of the Lord is equally beneficial to all, for those who are muktas, liberated, it is especially pleasing. As described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Eighth Canto, Third Chapter, verse 20, because pure devotees, who no longer have any material desires, surrender fully to the lotus feet of the Lord, they always merge in the ocean of bliss by chanting and hearing the Lord\u2019s holy name. According to this verse, devotees like N\u0101rada and other residents of \u015avetadv\u012bpa are seen always engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord because by such chanting they are always externally and internally blissful. The mumuk\u1e63us, persons desiring to be liberated, do not depend on the pleasures of the senses; instead, they concentrate fully on becoming liberated by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Karm\u012bs like to create something pleasing to their ears and hearts, and although they sometimes like to chant or hear the glories of the Lord, they do not do it openly. Devotees, however, always spontaneously hear, chant about and remember the activities of the Lord, and by this process they are fully satisfied, even though these may seem like topics of sense gratification. Simply by hearing the transcendental narrations of the Lord\u2019s activities, Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was liberated. He was therefore \u015brotramano-\u2019bhir\u0101ma; that is, he glorified the process of hearing. This process should be accepted by all living entities. To distinguish persons who are bereft of these transcendental pleasures, Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja has used the words virajyeta pum\u0101n. The word pum\u0101n refers to any person, whether man, woman or in-between. Because of the bodily conception of life, we are subject to lamentation, but one who has no such bodily conceptions can take pleasure in transcendental hearing and chanting. Therefore a person fully absorbed in the bodily concept of life is surely killing himself by not making spiritual progress. Such a person is called pa\u015bu-ghna. Especially excluded from spiritual life are the animal hunters, who are not interested in hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord. Such hunters are always unhappy, both in this life and in the next. It is therefore said that a hunter should neither die nor live because for such persons both living and dying are troublesome. Animal hunters are completely different from ordinary karm\u012bs, and thus they have been excluded from the process of hearing and chanting. Vin\u0101 pa\u015bu-ghn\u0101t. They cannot enter into the transcendental pleasure of chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord. The word mah\u0101-ratha refers to a great hero who can fight alone against eleven thousand other heroes, and the word atiratha, as found in text five, refers to one who can fight against an unlimited number. This is mentioned in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata as follows: This is the description given in the B\u1e5bhad-vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b by \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b. M\u0101y\u0101-manu\u1e63yasya (10.1.17). Because of being covered by yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 (n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sarvasya yoga-m\u0101y\u0101-sam\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25), K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sometimes called m\u0101y\u0101-manu\u1e63ya, indicating that although He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He appears like an ordinary person. A misunderstanding arises because yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 covers the vision of the general public. The Lord\u2019s position is actually different from that of an ordinary person, for although He appears to act like an ordinary man, He is always transcendental. The word m\u0101y\u0101 also indicates \u201cmercy,\u201d and sometimes it also means \u201cknowledge.\u201d The Lord is always full of all transcendental knowledge, and therefore although He acts like a human being, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, full of knowledge. In His original identity, the Lord is the controller of m\u0101y\u0101 (may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram). Therefore the Lord may be called m\u0101y\u0101-manu\u1e63ya, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing like an ordinary human being, although He is the controller of both the material and spiritual energies. The Lord is the Supreme Person, Puru\u1e63ottama, but because we are deluded by yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, He appears to be an ordinary person. Ultimately, however, yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 induces even a nondevotee to understand the Lord as the Supreme Person, Puru\u1e63ottama. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we find two statements given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the devotees, the Lord says: \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d (Bg. 10.10) Thus for the willing devotee the Lord gives intelligence by which to understand Him and return home, back to Godhead. For others, for nondevotees, the Lord says, m\u1e5btyu\u1e25 sarva-hara\u015b c\u0101ham: \u201cI am all-plundering, inevitable death.\u201d A devotee like Prahl\u0101da enjoys the activities of Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, whereas nondevotees like Prahl\u0101da\u2019s father, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, meet death before Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva. The Lord therefore acts in two ways, by sending some onto the path of repeated birth and death and sending others back home, back to Godhead. The word k\u0101la, meaning \u201cblack,\u201d indicates the color of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord R\u0101macandra, who both look blackish, give liberation and transcendental bliss to Their devotees. Among persons possessing material bodies, sometimes someone is able to subject death to his own will. For such a person, death is almost impossible because no one wants to die. But although Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva possessed this power, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, by the supreme will of the Lord, died very easily in the Lord\u2019s presence. There have also been many demons who had no hope of salvation, yet Ka\u1e41sa attained salvation by the supreme will of the Lord. Not to speak of Ka\u1e41sa, even P\u016btan\u0101 attained salvation and reached the level of the Lord\u2019s mother. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, therefore, was very eager to hear about the Lord, who has inconceivable qualities by which to give liberation to anyone. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, at the point of his death, was certainly interested in his liberation. When such a great and exalted personality as the Lord behaves like an ordinary human being although possessing inconceivable qualities, His behavior is called m\u0101y\u0101. Therefore the Lord is described as m\u0101y\u0101-manu\u1e63ya. This is the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. Mu refers to mukti, or salvation, and ku refers to that which is bad or very obnoxious. Thus muku refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who saves one from the bad condition of material existence. The Lord is called mukunda because He not only saves the devotee from material existence but offers him transcendental bliss in love and service. As for Ke\u015bava, ka means Brahm\u0101, and \u012b\u015ba means Lord \u015aiva. The Personality of Godhead captivates both Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord Mah\u0101deva, or \u015aiva, by His transcendental qualities. Therefore He is called Ke\u015bava. This opinion is given by San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b commentary. It is said that all the demigods, accompanied by Tri-nayana, Lord \u015aiva, went to the shore of the Ocean of Milk and offered their prayers through the mantra known as Puru\u1e63a-s\u016bkta. From this statement it is understood that the demigods cannot directly approach Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who lies on the Ocean of Milk, or enter His abode. This is also clearly stated in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Mok\u1e63a-dharma, and the next chapter of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has His abode in Goloka (goloka-n\u0101mni nija-dh\u0101mni tale ca tasya). From Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a come the catur-vy\u016bha, the quadruple expansions Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and V\u0101sudeva. There are innumerable brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0das, all of which emanate from the pores of K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and in every brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da there is a Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is a partial expansion of Aniruddha. This Aniruddha is a partial expansion of Pradyumna, who is partially represented as K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supersoul of all living entities. These Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions are different from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who resides in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. When it is said that the demigods offered prayers to the Lord by chanting the Puru\u1e63a-s\u016bkta, this indicates that they pleased the Lord by enunciating prayers of bhakti. The word v\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101kapi refers to one who satisfies His devotee in every way and frees His devotee from all material anxieties. V\u1e5b\u1e63a refers to religious performances like sacrifices. Even without the execution of sacrifices, the Lord can still enjoy the supermost comforts of the heavenly planets. The statement that Puru\u1e63ottama, Jagann\u0101tha, would appear in the house of Vasudeva distinguishes the Supreme Personality of Godhead from ordinary persons. The statement that He personally appeared indicates that He did not send His plenary expansion. The word priy\u0101rtham indicates that the Lord appeared to please Rukmi\u1e47\u012b and R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. Priy\u0101 means \u201cthe most beloved.\u201d In the commentary of \u015ar\u012b V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya, the following extra verse is accepted after text twenty-three: \u201cO demigods, even great sages, following the order of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, appeared in the forms of cows and calves to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead by delivering milk.\u201d R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya sometimes accepts Baladeva as a \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba-avat\u0101ra, but \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has explained that Baladeva is an expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that a part of Baladeva is Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. Although Baladeva is identical with Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, He is the origin of Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. Therefore the word svar\u0101\u1e6d has been used to indicate that Baladeva always exists in His own independence. The word svar\u0101\u1e6d also indicates that Baladeva is beyond the material conception of existence. M\u0101y\u0101 cannot attract Him, but because He is fully independent, He can appear by His spiritual potency wherever He likes. M\u0101y\u0101 is fully under the control of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Because the material potency and Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 mingle in the Lord\u2019s appearance, they are described as ek\u0101na\u1e41\u015b\u0101. Sometimes ek\u0101na\u1e41\u015b\u0101 is interpreted to mean \u201cwithout differentiation.\u201d Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a and \u015ae\u1e63a-n\u0101ga are identical. As stated by Yamun\u0101dev\u012b, \u201cO R\u0101ma, O great-armed master of the world, who have extended Yourself throughout the entire universe by one plenary expansion, it is not possible to understand You fully.\u201d Therefore ek\u0101\u1e41\u015b\u0101 refers to \u015ae\u1e63a-n\u0101ga. In other words, Baladeva, merely by His partial expansion, sustains the entire universe. The word k\u0101ry\u0101rthe refers to one who attracted the pregnancy of Devak\u012b and bewildered mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. These pastimes are very confidential. The Supreme Personality of Godhead ordered Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 to bewilder His associates in His pastimes and bewilder demons like Ka\u1e41sa. As stated previously, yoga-m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 sam\u0101di\u015bat. To give service to the Lord, Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 appeared along with Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101. Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 refers to yay\u0101 sammohita\u1e41 jagat, \u201cone who bewilders the entire material world.\u201d From this statement it is to be understood that Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, in her partial expansion, becomes Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 and bewilders the conditioned souls. In other words, the entire creation has two divisions \u2014 transcendental, or spiritual, and material. Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 manages the spiritual world, and by her partial expansion as Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 she manages the material world. As stated in the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 is a partial expansion of Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. The N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra clearly states that the Supreme Personality has one potency, which is sometimes described as Durg\u0101. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 says, ch\u0101yeva yasya bhuvan\u0101ni bibharti durg\u0101. Durg\u0101 is not different from Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. When one understands Durg\u0101 properly, he is immediately liberated, for Durg\u0101 is originally the spiritual potency, hl\u0101din\u012b-\u015bakti, by whose mercy one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. R\u0101dh\u0101 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pra\u1e47aya-vik\u1e5btir hl\u0101din\u012b-\u015baktir asm\u0101d. The mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101-\u015bakti, however, is a covering of Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, and she is therefore called the covering potency. By this covering potency, the entire material world is bewildered (yay\u0101 sammohita\u1e41 jagat). In conclusion, bewildering the conditioned souls and liberating the devotees are both functions belonging to Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Transferring the pregnancy of Devak\u012b and keeping mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 in deep sleep were both done by Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 cannot act upon such devotees, for they are always liberated. But although it is not possible for Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 to control liberated souls or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, she did bewilder Ka\u1e41sa. The action of Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 in presenting herself before Ka\u1e41sa was the action of Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, not Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 cannot even see or touch such polluted persons as Ka\u1e41sa. In Ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b, in the M\u0101rka\u1e47\u1e0deya Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Eleventh Chapter, Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 says, \u201cDuring the twenty-eighth yuga in the period of Vaivasvata Manu, I shall take birth as the daughter of Ya\u015bod\u0101 and be known as Vindhy\u0101cala-v\u0101sin\u012b.\u201d The distinction between the two m\u0101y\u0101s \u2014 Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 and Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 \u2014 is described as follows. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101 with the gop\u012bs and the gop\u012bs\u2019 bewilderment in respect to their husbands, fathers-in-law and other such relatives were arrangements of Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 in which Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 had no influence. The Bh\u0101gavatam gives sufficient evidence of this when it clearly says, yoga-m\u0101y\u0101m up\u0101\u015brita\u1e25. On the other hand, there were asuras headed by \u015a\u0101lva and k\u1e63atriyas like Duryodhana who were bereft of devotional service in spite of seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s carrier Garu\u1e0da and the universal form, and who could not understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This was also bewilderment, but this bewilderment was due to mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101. Therefore it is to be concluded that the m\u0101y\u0101 which drags a person from the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called ja\u1e0da-m\u0101y\u0101, and the m\u0101y\u0101 which acts on the transcendental platform is called yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. When Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was taken away by Varu\u1e47a, he saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s opulence, but nonetheless he thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his son. Such feelings of parental love in the spiritual world are acts of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, not of ja\u1e0da-m\u0101y\u0101, or mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101. This is the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura. \u015a\u016brasen\u0101\u1e41\u015b ca. The son of K\u0101rtav\u012bry\u0101rjuna was \u015a\u016brasena, and the countries he ruled were also called \u015a\u016brasena. This is noted by San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b commentary. In regard to Mathur\u0101, we find this quotation: When a self-realized soul acts in his transcendental position, his situation is called Mathur\u0101. In other words, when one acts in the process of bhakti-yoga, he may live anywhere, but actually he lives in Mathur\u0101, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Devotion to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, is the essence of all knowledge, and wherever such knowledge is manifested is called Mathur\u0101. Also, when one establishes bhakti-yoga, excluding all other methods, one\u2019s situation is called Mathur\u0101. Yatra nitya\u1e41 sannihito hari\u1e25: the place where Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, lives eternally is called Mathur\u0101. The word nitya indicates eternality. The Supreme Lord is eternal, and His abode is also eternal. Goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25. Although the Lord is always stationed in His abode, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, He is present everywhere in fullness. This means that when the Supreme Lord descends to the surface of the world, His original abode is not vacant, for He can remain in His original abode and simultaneously descend upon Mathur\u0101, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Ayodhy\u0101 and other places. He does not need to descend, since He is already present there; He simply manifests Himself. \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has addressed Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it as t\u0101ta, or \u201cbeloved son.\u201d This is due to parental love in the heart of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was soon coming as the son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, out of parental affection \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b addressed Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it as t\u0101ta, \u201cmy dear son.\u201d In the Vi\u015bva-ko\u015ba dictionary, the word garbha is explained: garbho bhr\u016b\u1e47e arbhake kuk\u1e63\u0101v ity \u0101di. When Ka\u1e41sa was about to kill Devak\u012b, Vasudeva wanted to dissuade him by the diplomacy of s\u0101ma and bheda. S\u0101ma means \u201cpacifying.\u201d Vasudeva wanted to pacify Ka\u1e41sa by indicating relations, gain, welfare, identity and glorification. Reference to these five concerns constitutes s\u0101ma, and Vasudeva\u2019s presentation of fear in two situations \u2014 in this life and the next \u2014 is called bheda. Thus Vasudeva used both s\u0101ma and bheda to pacify Ka\u1e41sa. Praising Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s qualifications was glorification, and praising him as a descendant of the bhoja-va\u1e41\u015ba appealed to sambandha, relationship. Speaking of \u201cyour sister\u201d was an appeal to identity. Speaking about killing a woman raises questions about fame and welfare, and arousing fear of the sinful act of killing one\u2019s sister during her marriage ceremony is an aspect of bheda. The Bhoja dynasty refers to those who were simply interested in sense gratification and were therefore not very aristocratic. Another meaning of bhoja is \u201cfighting.\u201d These were indications of defamation for Ka\u1e41sa. When Vasudeva addressed Ka\u1e41sa as d\u012bna-vatsala, this was excessive praise. Ka\u1e41sa would accept calves as a form of revenue from his poor constituents, and therefore he was called d\u012bna-vatsala. Vasudeva knew very well that he could not by force rescue Devak\u012b from the imminent danger. Devak\u012b was actually the daughter of Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s uncle, and therefore she is described as suh\u1e5bt, meaning \u201crelative.\u201d It is stated that Ka\u1e41sa refrained from killing his close relation Devak\u012b because if he had killed her, a great fight would have ensued among the other members of the family. Ka\u1e41sa refrained from provoking this great danger of a family fight, for it would have caused many persons to lose their lives. Formerly an asura named K\u0101lanemi had six sons, named Ha\u1e41sa, Suvikrama, Kr\u0101tha, Damana, Ripurmardana and Krodhahant\u0101. They were known as the \u1e63a\u1e0d-garbhas, or six garbhas, and they were all equally powerful and expert in military affairs. These \u1e63a\u1e0d-garbhas gave up the association of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, their grandfather, and underwent great austerities to satisfy Lord Brahm\u0101, who, upon being satisfied, agreed to give them whatever benediction they might desire. When asked by Lord Brahm\u0101 to state what they wanted, the \u1e63\u0101\u1e0d-garbhas replied, \u201cDear Lord Brahm\u0101, if you want to give us a benediction, give us the blessing that we will not be killed by any demigod, mahoraga, Yak\u1e63a, Gandharva-pati, Siddha, C\u0101ra\u1e47a or human being, nor by great sages who are perfect in their penances and austerities.\u201d Brahm\u0101 understood their purpose and fulfilled their desire. But when Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu came to know of these events, he was very angry at his grandsons. \u201cYou have given up my association and have gone to worship Lord Brahm\u0101,\u201d he said, \u201cand therefore I no longer have any affection for you. You have tried to save yourselves from the hands of the demigods, but I curse you in this way: Your father will take birth as Ka\u1e41sa and kill all of you because you will take birth as sons of Devak\u012b.\u201d Because of this curse, the grandsons of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu had to take birth from the womb of Devak\u012b and be killed by Ka\u1e41sa, although he was previously their father. This description is mentioned in the Hari-va\u1e41\u015ba, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-parva, Second Chapter. According to the comments of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b, the son of Devak\u012b known as K\u012brtim\u0101n was the third incarnation. In his first incarnation he was known as Smara and was the son of Mar\u012bci, and later he became the son of K\u0101lanemi. This is mentioned in the histories. An additional verse in this chapter of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is accepted by the Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya samprad\u0101ya, represented by Vijayadhvaja T\u012brtha. The verse is as follows: atha \u2014 in this way; ka\u1e41sam \u2014 unto Ka\u1e41sa; up\u0101gamya \u2014 after going; n\u0101rada\u1e25 \u2014 the great sage N\u0101rada; brahma-nandana\u1e25 \u2014 who is the son of Brahm\u0101; ek\u0101ntam upasa\u1e45gamya \u2014 after going to a very solitary place; v\u0101kyam \u2014 the following instruction; etat \u2014 this; uv\u0101ca \u2014 said; ha \u2014 in the past. Translation: \u201cThereafter, N\u0101rada, the mental son of Lord Brahm\u0101, approached Ka\u1e41sa and, in a very solitary place, informed him of the following news.\u201d The great saint N\u0101rada descended from the heavenly planets to the forest of Mathur\u0101 and sent his messenger to Ka\u1e41sa. When the messenger approached Ka\u1e41sa and informed him of N\u0101rada\u2019s arrival, Ka\u1e41sa, the leader of the asuras, was very happy and immediately came out of his palace to receive N\u0101rada, who was as bright as the sun, as powerful as fire, and free from all tinges of sinful activities. Ka\u1e41sa accepted N\u0101rada as his guest, offered him respectful obeisances and gave him a golden seat, brilliant like the sun. N\u0101rada was a friend of the King of heaven, and thus he told Ka\u1e41sa, the son of Ugrasena, \u201cMy dear hero, you have satisfied me with a proper reception, and therefore I shall tell you something secret and confidential. While I was coming here from Nandak\u0101nana through the Caitraratha forest, I saw a great meeting of the demigods, who followed me to Sumeru Parvata. We traveled through many holy places, and finally we saw the holy Ganges. While Lord Brahm\u0101 was consulting the other demigods at the top of Sumeru Hill, I was also present with my stringed instrument, the v\u012b\u1e47\u0101. I shall tell you confidentially that the meeting was held just to plan to kill the asuras, headed by you. You have a younger sister named Devak\u012b, and it is a fact that her eighth son will kill you.\u201d (Hari-va\u1e41\u015ba, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-parva 1.2-16) No one can blame N\u0101radaj\u012b for encouraging Ka\u1e41sa to kill the sons of Devak\u012b. The saint N\u0101rada is always a well-wisher for human society, and he wanted the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, to descend to this world as soon as possible so that the society of demigods would be pleased and would see Ka\u1e41sa and his friends killed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Ka\u1e41sa would also attain salvation from his nefarious activities, and this too would very much please the demigods and their followers. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks in this connection that N\u0101rada Muni sometimes did things that were beneficial to the demigods and the demons simultaneously. \u015ar\u012b V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya, in his commentary, has included the following half-verse in this regard: asur\u0101\u1e25 sarva evaita lokopadrava-k\u0101ri\u1e47a\u1e25. Asuras are always disturbing elements for human society."
