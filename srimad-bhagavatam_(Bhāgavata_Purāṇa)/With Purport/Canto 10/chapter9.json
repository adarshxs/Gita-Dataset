While churning, she remembered the childish activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and in her own way she composed songs and enjoyed singing to herself about all those activities.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, quoting from the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b of \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, says that the incident of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s breaking the pot of yogurt and being bound by mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 took place on the D\u012bp\u0101val\u012b Day, or D\u012bpa-m\u0101lik\u0101. Even today in India, this festival is generally celebrated very gorgeously in the month of K\u0101rtika by fireworks and lights, especially in Bombay. It is to be understood that among all the cows of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, several of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101\u2019s cows ate only grasses so flavorful that the grasses would automatically flavor the milk. Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 wanted to collect the milk from these cows, make it into yogurt and churn it into butter personally, since she thought that this child K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was going to the houses of neighborhood gopas and gop\u012bs to steal butter because He did not like the milk and yogurt ordinarily prepared. While churning the butter, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was singing about the childhood activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It was formerly a custom that if one wanted to remember something constantly, he would transform it into poetry or have this done by a professional poet. It appears that mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 did not want to forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities at any time. Therefore she poeticized all of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s childhood activities, such as the killing of P\u016btan\u0101, Agh\u0101sura, \u015aaka\u1e6d\u0101sura and T\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101varta, and while churning the butter, she sang about these activities in poetical form. This should be the practice of persons eager to remain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious twenty-four hours a day. This incident shows how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 was. To stay in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we should follow such persons."

This is the difference between a yog\u012b and a bhakta. Yog\u012bs cannot enter even the effulgence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Yasya prabh\u0101 prabhavato jagad-a\u1e47\u1e0da-ko\u1e6di-ko\u1e6di\u1e63u (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.40). In that effulgence there are millions of universes, but yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs cannot enter that effulgence even after many, many years of austerities, whereas bhaktas can capture K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a simply by love and affection. This is the example shown here by mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore confirms that if one wants to capture Him, one must undertake devotional service. Bhaktas enter even the planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very easily, but the less intelligent yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, by their meditation, remain running after K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even if they enter K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s effulgence, they fall down."

Yog\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, karm\u012bs and Ved\u0101ntists cannot even approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; they must remain very, very far away from Him and try to enter His bodily effulgence, although this also they are unable to do. Great demigods like Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva always worship the Lord by meditation and by service. Even the most powerful Yamar\u0101ja fears K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, as we find in the history of Aj\u0101mila, Yamar\u0101ja instructed his followers not even to approach the devotees, what to speak of capturing them. In other words, Yamar\u0101ja also fears K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees. Yet this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a became so dependent on mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 that when she simply showed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the stick in her hand, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a admitted to being an offender and began to cry like an ordinary child. Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, of course, did not want to chastise her beloved child very much, and therefore she immediately threw her stick away and simply rebuked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, saying, \u201cNow I shall bind You so that You cannot commit any further offensive activities. Nor for the time being can You play with Your playmates.\u201d This shows the position of a pure devotee, in contrast with others, like j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, yog\u012bs and the followers of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, in regarding the transcendental nature of the Absolute Truth."

The word brahma means \u201cthe greatest.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is greater than the greatest, being unlimited and all-pervading.

We have measurements of time, but although we are limited by past, present and future, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a these do not exist. Every individual person can be measured, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has already shown that although He also is an individual, the entire cosmic manifestation is within His mouth. All these points considered, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be measured. How then did Ya\u015bod\u0101 want to measure Him and bind Him? We must conclude that this took place simply on the platform of pure transcendental love. This was the only cause. Everything is one because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme cause of everything. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be measured or calculated by Vedic knowledge (vede\u1e63u durlabham). He is available only to devotees (adurlabham \u0101tma-bhaktau).

Now K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibited another vibh\u016bti, or display of potency, to mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. \u201cUnless I agree,\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desired to show, \u201cyou cannot bind Me.\u201d Thus although mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, in her attempt to bind K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, added one rope after another, ultimately she was a failure. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a agreed, however, she was successful. In other words, one must be in transcendental love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but that does not mean that one can control K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is satisfied with one\u2019s devotional service, He does everything Himself. Sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau svayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25. He reveals more and more to the devotee as the devotee advances in service. Jihv\u0101dau: this service begins with the tongue, with chanting and with taking the pras\u0101da of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

Yet the Supreme Lord has one transcendental attribute: He comes under the control of His devotees. This was now exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this pastime.",
        "purport": " This pastime of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s is very difficult to understand, but devotees can understand it. It is therefore said, dar\u015baya\u1e41s tad-vid\u0101\u1e41 loka \u0101tmano bhakta-va\u015byat\u0101m (Bh\u0101g. 10.11.9): the Lord displays the transcendental attribute of coming under the control of His devotees. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.35): By His one plenary portion as Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Lord controls innumerable universes, with all their demigods; yet He agrees to be controlled by a devotee. In the Upani\u1e63ads it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can run with more speed than the mind, but here we see that although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to avoid being arrested by His mother, He was finally defeated, and mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 captured Him. Lak\u1e63m\u012b-sahasra-\u015bata-sambhrama-sevyam\u0101nam: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. Nonetheless, He steals butter like one who is poverty-stricken. Yamar\u0101ja, the controller of all living entities, fears the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, yet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is afraid of His mother\u2019s stick. These contradictions cannot be understood by one who is not a devotee, but a devotee can understand how powerful is unalloyed devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; it is so powerful that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be controlled by an unalloyed devotee. This bh\u1e5btya-va\u015byat\u0101 does not mean that He is under the control of the servant; rather, He is under the control of the servant\u2019s pure love. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (1.21) it is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a became the chariot driver of Arjuna. Arjuna ordered Him, senayor ubhayor madhye ratha\u1e41 sth\u0101paya me\u00a0\u2019cyuta: \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, You have agreed to be my charioteer and to execute my orders. Place my chariot between the two armies of soldiers.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately executed this order, and therefore one may argue that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also is not independent. But this is one\u2019s aj\u00f1\u0101na, ignorance. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always fully independent; when He becomes subordinate to His devotees, this is a display of \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa, the humor of transcendental qualities that increases His transcendental pleasure. Everyone worships K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He sometimes desires to be controlled by someone else. Such a controller can be no one else but a pure devotee."

As for Lord \u015aiva, he is the topmost Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava (vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 yath\u0101 \u015bambhu\u1e25). What to speak of Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b, is the Lord\u2019s constant companion in service, since she always associates with His body. But even she could not get such mercy. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was surprised, thinking, \u201cWhat did mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja do in their previous lives by which they got such a great opportunity, the opportunity to be the affectionate father and mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a?\u201d In this verse there are three negative pronouncements \u2014 na, na, na. When anything is uttered three times \u2014 \u201cdo it, do it, do it\u201d \u2014 one should understand that this is meant to indicate great stress on a fact. In this verse, we find na lebhire, na lebhire, na lebhire. Yet mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 is in the supermost exalted position, and thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has become completely subordinate to her. The word vimuktid\u0101t is also significant. There are different types of liberation, such as s\u0101yujya, s\u0101lokya, s\u0101r\u016bpya, s\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6di and s\u0101m\u012bpya, but vimukti means \u201cspecial mukti.\u201d When after liberation one is situated on the platform of prema-bhakti, one is said to have achieved vimukti, \u201cspecial mukti.\u201d Therefore the word na is mentioned. That exalted platform of prem\u0101 is described by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu as prem\u0101 pum-artho mah\u0101n, and mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 naturally acts in such an exalted position in loving affairs. She is therefore a nitya-siddha devotee, an expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hl\u0101din\u012b potency, His potency to enjoy transcendental bliss through expansions who are special devotees (\u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibh\u0101vit\u0101bhi\u1e25). Such devotees are not s\u0101dhana-siddha."

        "purport": " K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, is very easily available to devotees, but not to tapasv\u012bs, yog\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and others who have a bodily concept of life. Although they may sometimes be called \u015b\u0101nta-bhaktas, real bhakti begins with d\u0101sya-rasa. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.11): \u201cAs living entities surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101.\u201d Everyone is seeking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for He is the Supersoul of all individual souls. Everyone loves his body and wants to protect it because he is within the body as the soul, and everyone loves the soul because the soul is part and parcel of the Supersoul. Therefore, everyone is actually seeking to achieve happiness by reviving his relationship with the Supersoul. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: \u201cBy all the Vedas, it is I who am to be known.\u201d Therefore, the karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, yog\u012bs and saintly persons are all seeking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But by following in the footsteps of devotees who are in a direct relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, especially the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, one can reach the supreme position of associating with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As it is said, v\u1e5bnd\u0101vana\u1e41 parityajya padam eka\u1e41 na gacchati: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not leave V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana even for a moment. The v\u1e5bnd\u0101vana-v\u0101s\u012bs \u2014 mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s conjugal lovers, the younger gop\u012bs with whom He dances \u2014 have very intimate relationships with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and if one follows in the footsteps of these devotees, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is available. Although the nitya-siddha expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always remain with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, if those engaged in s\u0101dhana-siddhi follow in the footsteps of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s nitya-siddha associates, such s\u0101dhana-siddhas also can easily attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without difficulty. But there are those who are attached to bodily concepts of life. Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, for example, have very prestigious positions, and thus they have the sense of being very exalted \u012b\u015bvaras. In other words, because Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva are gu\u1e47a-avat\u0101ras and have exalted positions, they have some small sense of being like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But the pure devotees who inhabit V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana do not possess any bodily conception. They are fully dedicated to the service of the Lord in sublime affection, prem\u0101. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has therefore recommended, prem\u0101 pum-artho mah\u0101n: the highest perfection of life is prem\u0101, pure love in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 appears to be the topmost of devotees who have attained this perfection."
