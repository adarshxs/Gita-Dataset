The idea is that the Vedic mantras must be enunciated perfectly and chanted with the proper accent; if the priests who are engaged in this business commit any mistake, the checker, or referee priest, immediately corrects the procedure, and thus the ritualistic performances are perfectly executed. Unless it is perfectly executed, a sacrifice cannot yield the desired result. In this Age of Kali there is no such learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a or priest available; therefore, all such sacrifices are forbidden. The only sacrifice recommended in the \u015b\u0101stras is the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra.\u201d"

Agra means \u2018first,\u2019 and p\u016bj\u0101 means \u2018worship.\u2019 This agra-p\u016bj\u0101 is similar to the election of a president. In the sacrificial assembly, all the members were very exalted. Some proposed to elect one person as the perfect candidate for accepting agra-p\u016bj\u0101, and others proposed someone else. As the great \u0101c\u0101rya J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b points out, text 15 of this chapter states that the members of the assembly were not astonished at the opulence of the sacrifice, since they knew that King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Still, text 18 now states that the assembly could not select the most deserving candidate for being worshiped first. This indicates that many of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as present were not fully realized transcendentalists but rather conventional br\u0101hma\u1e47as uncertain of the supreme conclusion of Vedic wisdom. Similarly, \u0100c\u0101rya Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha comments that the undecided members of the assembly were the less intelligent ones, and not such exalted personalities as Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and Dvaip\u0101yana Vy\u0101sadeva, who thought, \u201cSince today no one is asking our opinion, why should we say anything? Furthermore, here is Sahadeva, who is renowned for his sharp skill in analyzing all sorts of circumstances. He can help appoint the person who is to be worshiped first. Only if he somehow fails to speak or cannot understand the situation will we speak up, despite no one\u2019s having inquired from us.\u201d Having made up their minds in this way, the greatest personalities remained silent. This is how Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b advises us to understand what occurred in the assembly."

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energies are like the heat and light of the fire; there is no difference between the qualities of heat and light and the fire itself.\u2026 He should therefore be offered the first worship of this great sacrifice, and no one should disagree.\u2026 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present as the Supersoul in every living being, and if we can satisfy Him, then automatically every living being becomes satisfied.\u2019\u201d"

Instead of being happy to hear the glories of the Lord, he became very angry.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b mentions that the reason \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la did not object when Sahadeva proposed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for the agra-p\u016bj\u0101 is that \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la wanted to ruin King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s sacrifice. If \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la had argued earlier against Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s receiving the first worship and another person had been selected, the sacrifice would have then proceeded normally. Therefore \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la allowed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be selected, waited until the worship was over, and then spoke up, hoping in this way to demonstrate that the sacrifice was now spoiled. Thus he would ruin the endeavor of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira.

But the word may also be analyzed as ku-lap\u0101m a\u1e41sana, giving a totally different meaning. Kulap\u0101m indicates those who prattle with crooked words contrary to the Vedas, and a\u1e41sana, derived from the verb a\u1e41sayati, means \u201cdestroyer.\u201d In other words, he was praising Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as \u201cHe who vanquishes all misguided and frivolous speculations about the nature of truth.\u201d Similarly, although \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la wanted to compare Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to a crow with the words yath\u0101 k\u0101ka\u1e25, these words may also be divided yath\u0101 a-k\u0101ka\u1e25. In that case, according to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, the word k\u0101ka is a combination of ka and \u0101ka, which indicate material happiness and misery. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ak\u0101ka in the sense that He is beyond all material misery and happiness, being on the pure, transcendental platform. Finally, \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la was right in saying the Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not deserve merely the puro\u1e0d\u0101\u015ba rice cake, offered to the lesser demigods as a substitute for the heavenly beverage soma. In fact, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a deserves to receive everything that we possess, since He is the ultimate proprietor of everything, including ourselves. Thus we should give Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a our life and soul, not merely a ritualistic offering of rice cakes."

Because of an offense, the four Kum\u0101ras cursed them to take three births in the material world as demons. The first birth was as Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, the second as R\u0101va\u1e47a and Kumbhakar\u1e47a, and the third as \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la and Dantavakra. In each birth they were completely absorbed in enmity toward the Lord and were slain by Him. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da explains the position of \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la as follows: \u201cAlthough \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la acted as the enemy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he was not for a single moment out of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He was always absorbed in thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus he got the salvation of s\u0101yujya-mukti, merging into the existence of the Supreme, and finally became reinstated in his original position of personal service. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 corroborates the fact that one who is absorbed in the thought of the Supreme Lord at the time of death immediately enters the kingdom of God after quitting his material body.\u201d The Third and Seventh cantos of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam elaborately describe the incident wherein the Lord\u2019s personal associates were cursed to come to the material world as His enemies. In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b quotes the following verse (Bh\u0101g. 7.1.47): \u201cThese two associates of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2014 Jaya and Vijaya \u2014 maintained a feeling of enmity for a very long time. Because of always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this way, they regained the shelter of the Lord, having returned home, back to Godhead.\u201d"
