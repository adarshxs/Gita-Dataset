He further explains that jana may also be translated as \u201cparents,\u201d since jana is derived from the verb jan, which in the causative form (janayate) means \u201cto generate or to give birth to.\u201d In this sense of the word (as in janan\u012b or janakau), the term jana-mohin\u012b indicates that the Lord was about to expand His internal illusory potency so that Vasudeva and Devak\u012b would again love Him as their dear child."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b discusses this verse as follows: \u201cOne may object that at this point Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had not actually passed the kai\u015bora stage [age ten to fifteen], since the women of Mathur\u0101 had stated, kva c\u0101ti-sukum\u0101r\u0101\u1e45gau ki\u015borau n\u0101pta-yauvanau: \u2018K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma have very tender limbs, being still at the ki\u015bora stage, not having reached adolescence.\u2019 (Bh\u0101g. 10.44.8) The definition of the different stages of growing up is given as follows: \u2018The kaum\u0101ra stage lasts until the age of five, pauga\u1e47\u1e0da up to age ten and kai\u015bora to age fifteen. From then on, one is known as yauvana.\u2019 According to this statement, the kai\u015bora period ends at the age of fifteen. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was only eleven years old when He killed Ka\u1e41sa, according to Uddhava\u2019s words: ek\u0101da\u015ba-sam\u0101s tatra g\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101rci\u1e25 sa-balo\u00a0\u2019vasat. \u2018Like a covered flame, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remained there incognito with Balar\u0101ma for eleven years.\u2019 (Bh\u0101g. 3.2.26) And since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma never took brahminical initiation in Vraja-bh\u016bmi, it was at the time [of Their going to Mathur\u0101] that Their kai\u015bora stage began rather than ended. \u201cThis objection to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statement in the present verse \u2014 that His parents could not enjoy His kai\u015bora stage \u2014 is based on ordinary measurement of age. Yet we should consider the following statement: \u2018O King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, within a short time R\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a began to walk very easily in Gokula on Their legs, by Their own strength, without the need to crawl.\u2019 Sometimes we see that the son of a king, even while in his pauga\u1e47\u1e0da stage of life, undergoes exceptional physical growth and exhibits activities appropriate to a kai\u015bora. Then what to speak of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whose exceptional growth is established in the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b, Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu, \u0100nanda-v\u1e5bndavana-camp\u016b and other works? \u201cThe three years and four months that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stayed in Mah\u0101vana were the equivalent of five years for an ordinary child, and thus in that period He completed His kaum\u0101ra stage of childhood. The period from then to the age of six years and eight months, during which He lived in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, constitutes His pauga\u1e47\u1e0da stage. And the period from the age of six years and eight months through His tenth year, during which time He lived in Nand\u012b\u015bvara [Nandagr\u0101ma], constitutes His kai\u015bora stage. Then, at the age of ten years and seven months, on the eleventh lunar day of the dark fortnight of the month of Caitra, He went to Mathur\u0101, and on the fourteenth day thereafter He killed Ka\u1e41sa. Thus He completed His kai\u015bora period at age ten, and He eternally remains at that age. In other words, we should understand that from this point on the Lord remains forever a ki\u015bora.\u201d Thus \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b analyzes the intricacies of this verse."

They sometimes say that primitive men think that the ocean is a god or that the sun and moon are gods. In fact, references such as the word sindhu in this verse, meaning \u201cthe ocean,\u201d indicate the person who governs that aspect of physical nature. We can give several modern examples. In the United Nations we may say, \u201cThe United States votes \u2018Yes,\u2019 the Soviet Union votes \u2018No.\u2019\u201d We hardly mean that the physical countries or the buildings in them have voted. We mean that a particular person, representing that political and geographical entity, has voted. Yet the newspapers will simply say, \u201cThe United States voted, decided, etc.\u201d and everyone knows what that means. Similarly, in business we may say, \u201cA large conglomerate has swallowed up a smaller firm.\u201d We hardly mean that the buildings, office equipment and the like have physically swallowed another building full of workers and office equipment. We mean that the empowered authorities have engaged in a particular act on behalf of their respective corporate entities. Unfortunately, modern scholars are eager to confirm their pet theories that ancient spiritual wisdom is primitive, mythic and largely supplanted by more modern ways of thinking, exemplified by their own eloquent remarks. However, much in modern scholarship must be rethought in the light of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

According to the \u0101c\u0101ryas, Pa\u00f1cajana had become a demon in a way similar to that of Jaya and Vijaya. In other words, though appearing in the form of a demon, he was actually a devotee of the Lord. The Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Avanti-kha\u1e47\u1e0da, describes the wonderful things that happened when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sounded His conchshell: \u201cThe hell known as Asipatra-vana lost the sharp, swordlike leaves on its trees, and the hell named Raurava became free of its ruru beasts. The Bhairava hell lost its fearfulness, and all cooking stopped in the Kumbh\u012bp\u0101ka hell.\u201d The Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a further states: \u201cTheir sinful reactions eradicated, all the inhabitants of hell attained liberation and approached the spiritual world.\u201d"
