To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear millennium after millennium.\u201d The Lord\u2019s purpose in maintaining this material world is to give everyone a chance to go back home, back to Godhead, but kings and political leaders unfortunately try to hinder the purpose of the Lord, and therefore the Lord appears, either personally or with His plenary portions, to set things right.

At that time, Jar\u0101sandha, who was Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s father-in-law, was extremely powerful, and therefore Ka\u1e41sa took advantage of his protection and the help of the demons in persecuting the kings of the Yadu dynasty. The demons naturally appeared more powerful than the demigods, but ultimately, because of help received from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demons were defeated and the demigods triumphant."

That plenary portion is celebrated by great sages as Ananta, who belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s second quadruple expansion.",
        "purport": " Some of the chief devotees, such as Akr\u016bra, stayed with Ka\u1e41sa to satisfy him. This they did for various purposes. They all expected the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear as the eighth child as soon as Devak\u012b\u2019s other children were killed by Ka\u1e41sa, and they were eagerly awaiting His appearance. By remaining in Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s association, they would be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead take birth and display His childhood pastimes, and Akr\u016bra would later go to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to bring K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma to Mathur\u0101. The word paryup\u0101sate is significant because it indicates that some devotees wanted to stay near Ka\u1e41sa in order to see all these pastimes of the Lord. The six children killed by Ka\u1e41sa had formerly been sons of Mar\u012bci, but because of having been cursed by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, they were obliged to take birth as grandsons of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. Ka\u1e41sa had taken birth as K\u0101lanemi, and now he was obliged to kill his own sons. This was a mystery. As soon as the sons of Devak\u012b were killed, they would return to their original place. The devotees wanted to see this also. Generally speaking, no one kills his own nephews, but Ka\u1e41sa was so cruel that he did so without hesitation. Ananta, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, belongs to the second catur-vy\u016bha, or quadruple expansion. This is the opinion of experienced commentators."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the k\u1e63etra j\u00f1a, or Supersoul, of all living entities. He is the original source of all expansions of the Personality of Godhead.

A pure devotee is always fearful of material existence. No one knows what will happen next, for one may have to change his body at any moment (tath\u0101 deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101pti\u1e25). Knowing this fact, a pure devotee acts in such a way that he will not have his life spoiled by being obliged to accept another body and undergo the tribulations of material existence. This is bhayam, or fear. Bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101t (Bh\u0101g. 11.2.37). This fear is due to material existence. Properly speaking, everyone should always be alert and fearful of material existence, but although everyone is prone to be affected by the ignorance of material existence, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is always alert to the protection of His devotees. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind and affectionate toward His devotees that He helps them by giving them the intelligence by which to exist in this material world without forgetting Him even for a moment. The Lord says: \u201cOut of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.\u201d (Bg. 10.11) The word yoga means \u201clink.\u201d Any system of yoga is an attempt to reconnect our broken relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are different types of yoga, of which bhakti-yoga is the best. In other yoga systems, one must undergo various processes before attaining perfection, but bhakti-yoga is direct. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.47): \u201cOf all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\u201d For the bhakti-yog\u012b, a human body is guaranteed in his next existence, as stated by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u015buc\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 \u015br\u012bmat\u0101\u1e41 gehe yoga-bhra\u1e63\u1e6do\u00a0\u2019bhij\u0101yate). Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 is the spiritual potency of the Lord. Out of affection for His devotees, the Lord always stays in spiritual touch with them, although otherwise His M\u0101y\u0101 potency is so strong that she bewilders even exalted demigods like Brahm\u0101. Therefore the Lord\u2019s potency is called Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Since the Lord is Vi\u015bv\u0101tm\u0101, He immediately ordered Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 to give protection to Devak\u012b."

        "purport": " The first plenary expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Baladeva, also known as \u015ae\u1e63a. The \u015ae\u1e63a incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead supports the entire universe, and the eternal mother of this incarnation is mother Rohi\u1e47\u012b. \u201cBecause I am going into the womb of Devak\u012b,\u201d the Lord told Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, \u201cthe \u015ae\u1e63a incarnation has already gone there and made suitable arrangements so that I may live there. Now He should enter the womb of Rohi\u1e47\u012b, His eternal mother.\u201d In this connection, one may ask how the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always situated transcendentally, could enter the womb of Devak\u012b, which had previously been entered by the six asuras, the \u1e63a\u1e0d-garbhas. Does this mean that the \u1e63a\u1e0d-garbh\u0101suras were equal to the transcendental body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The following answer is given by \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura. The entire creation, as well as its individual parts, is an expansion of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, even though the Lord enters the material world, He does not do so. This is explained by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.4-5): \u201cBy Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them. And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities, and although I am everywhere, My Self is the very source of creation.\u201d Sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma. Everything is an expansion of Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet everything is not the Supreme Godhead, and He is not everywhere. Everything rests upon Him and yet does not rest upon Him. This can be explained only through the acintya-bhed\u0101bheda philosophy. Such truths cannot be understood, however, unless one is a pure devotee, for the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55), bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25: \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.\u201d Even though the Lord cannot be understood by ordinary persons, this principle should be understood from the statement of the \u015b\u0101stras. A pure devotee is always transcendentally situated because of executing nine different processes of bhakti-yoga (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smarana\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam/ arcana\u1e41 vandana\u1e41 d\u0101sya\u1e41 sakhyam \u0101tma-nivedanam). Thus situated in devotional service, a devotee, although in the material world, is not in the material world. Yet a devotee always fears, \u201cBecause I am associated with the material world, so many contaminations affect me.\u201d Therefore he is always alert in fear, which gradually diminishes his material association. Symbolically, mother Devak\u012b\u2019s constant fear of Ka\u1e41sa was purifying her. A pure devotee should always fear material association, and in this way all the asuras of material association will be killed, as the \u1e63a\u1e0d-garbh\u0101suras were killed by Ka\u1e41sa. It is said that from the mind, Mar\u012bci appears. In other words, Mar\u012bci is an incarnation of the mind. Mar\u012bci has six sons: K\u0101ma, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and M\u0101tsarya (lust, anger, greed, illusion, madness and envy). The Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in pure devotional service. This is confirmed in the Vedas: bhaktir evaina\u1e41 dar\u015bayati. Only bhakti can bring one in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared from the womb of Devak\u012b, and therefore Devak\u012b symbolically represents bhakti, and Ka\u1e41sa symbolically represents material fear. When a pure devotee always fears material association, his real position of bhakti is manifested, and he naturally becomes uninterested in material enjoyment. When the six sons of Mar\u012bci are killed by such fear and one is freed from material contamination, within the womb of bhakti the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears. Thus the seventh pregnancy of Devak\u012b signifies the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After the six sons K\u0101ma, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and M\u0101tsarya are killed, the \u015ae\u1e63a incarnation creates a suitable situation for the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, when one awakens his natural K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears. This is the explanation given by \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura."

With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.\u201d Everything is situated as a part of the Supreme Lord\u2019s potency. In regard to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance in the womb of Devak\u012b, Brahm\u0101 played a part also because on the bank of the Milk Ocean he requested the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear. A part was also played by Baladeva, the first expansion of Godhead. Similarly, Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, who appeared as the daughter of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, also played a part. Thus j\u012bva-tattva, vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva and \u015bakti-tattva are all integrated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears, He appears with all His integrated parts. As explained in previous verses, Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 was requested to attract Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Baladeva, from the womb of Devak\u012b to the womb of Rohi\u1e47\u012b, and this was a very heavy task for her. Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 naturally could not see how it was possible for her to attract Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a addressed her as \u015bubhe, auspicious, and said, \u201cBe blessed. Take power from Me, and you will be able to do it.\u201d By the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, anyone can do anything, for the Lord is present in everything, all things being His parts and parcels (a\u1e41\u015ba-bh\u0101gena) and increasing or decreasing by His supreme will. Balar\u0101ma was only fifteen days older than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By the blessings of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 became the daughter of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, but by the supreme will she was not able to enjoy the parental love of her father and mother. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, although not actually born from the womb of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, enjoyed the parental love of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and Nanda. By the blessings of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 was able to achieve the reputation of being the daughter of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, who also became famous by the blessings of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Such a person wants to enjoy the material world by taking birth in a highly elevated family with the benefits of education, beauty and immense wealth, which in this material world are desirable. One who has forgotten the real aim of life may worship the goddess Durg\u0101, m\u0101y\u0101-\u015bakti, under various names, for different purposes, and in different places. As there are many holy places for the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there are also many holy places in India for the worship of Durg\u0101dev\u012b, or M\u0101y\u0101dev\u012b, who took birth as the daughter of Ya\u015bod\u0101. After cheating Ka\u1e41sa, M\u0101y\u0101dev\u012b dispersed herself to various places, especially in Vindhy\u0101cala, to accept regular worship from ordinary men. A human being should actually be interested in understanding \u0101tma-tattva, the truth of \u0101tm\u0101, the spirit soul, and Param\u0101tm\u0101, the supreme soul. Those who are interested in \u0101tma-tattva worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead (yasmin vij\u00f1\u0101te sarvam eva\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 bhavati) (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.3). However, as explained in the next verse of this chapter, those who cannot understand \u0101tma-tattva (apa\u015byat\u0101m \u0101tma-tattvam) worship Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 in her different features. Therefore \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.1.2) says: \u201cThose persons who are materially engrossed, being blind to the knowledge of ultimate truth, have many subject matters for hearing in human society, O Emperor.\u201d Those who are interested in remaining in this material world and are not interested in spiritual salvation have many duties, but for one who is interested in spiritual salvation, the only duty is to surrender fully unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). Such a person is not interested in material enjoyment."

Essentially, those who are interested in material enjoyment are \u015b\u0101ktas, and those interested in spiritual salvation and attaining the spiritual kingdom are Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Because people are generally interested in material enjoyment, they are interested in worshiping M\u0101y\u0101dev\u012b, the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, however, are \u015buddha-\u015b\u0101ktas, or pure bhaktas, because the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra indicates worship of the Supreme Lord\u2019s energy, Har\u0101. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava prays to the energy of the Lord for the opportunity to serve the Lord along with His spiritual energy. Thus Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas all worship such Deities as R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, S\u012bt\u0101-R\u0101ma, Lak\u1e63m\u012b-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and Rukmi\u1e47\u012b-Dv\u0101rak\u0101dh\u012b\u015ba, whereas durg\u0101-\u015b\u0101ktas worship the material energy under different names. The names by which M\u0101y\u0101dev\u012b is known in different places have been listed by Vallabh\u0101c\u0101rya as follows. In V\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b she is known as Durg\u0101, in Avant\u012b she is known as Bhadrak\u0101l\u012b, in Orissa she is known as Vijay\u0101, and in Kulah\u0101pura she is known as Vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u012b or Mah\u0101lak\u1e63m\u012b. (The representatives of Mah\u0101lak\u1e63m\u012b and Ambik\u0101 are present in Bombay.) In the country known as K\u0101mar\u016bpa she is known as Ca\u1e47\u1e0dik\u0101, in Northern India as \u015a\u0101rad\u0101, and in Cape Comorin as Kanyak\u0101. Thus she is distributed according to various names in various places. \u015ar\u012bla Vijayadhvaja T\u012brthap\u0101da, in his Pada-ratn\u0101val\u012b-\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101, has explained the meanings of the different representations. M\u0101y\u0101 is known as Durg\u0101 because she is approached with great difficulty, as Bhadr\u0101 because she is auspicious, and as K\u0101l\u012b because she is deep blue. Because she is the most powerful energy, she is known as Vijay\u0101; because she is one of the different energies of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, she is known as Vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u012b; and because she enjoys in this material world and gives facilities for material enjoyment, she is known as Kumud\u0101. Because she is very severe to her enemies, the asuras, she is known as Ca\u1e47\u1e0dik\u0101, and because she gives all sorts of material facilities, she is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101. In this way the material energy is differently named and situated in different places on the surface of the globe."

When everyone lamented, Ka\u1e41sa joined in compassion, thinking that perhaps because of drugs or some other external means, Devak\u012b had undergone this abortion. The real story of what happened after Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 attracted the child of Devak\u012b into the womb of Rohi\u1e47\u012b in the seventh month of Rohi\u1e47\u012b\u2019s pregnancy is described as follows in the Hari-va\u1e41\u015ba. At midnight, while Rohi\u1e47\u012b was deeply sleeping, she experienced, as if in a dream, that she had undergone a miscarriage. After some time, when she awoke, she saw that this had indeed happened, and she was in great anxiety. But Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 then informed her, \u201cO auspicious lady, your child is now being replaced. I am attracting a child from the womb of Devak\u012b, and therefore your child will be known as Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a.\u201d The word yoga-nidr\u0101 is significant. When one is spiritually reconnected through self-realization, one regards his material life as having been like a dream. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.69): \u201cWhat is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.\u201d The stage of self-realization is called yoga-nidr\u0101. All material activities appear to be a dream when one is spiritually awakened. Thus yoga-nidr\u0101 may be explained to be Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101."

        "translation": "Thereafter, accompanied by plenary expansions, the fully opulent Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is all-auspicious for the entire universe, was transferred from the mind of Vasudeva to the mind of Devak\u012b. Devak\u012b, having thus been initiated by Vasudeva, became beautiful by carrying Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the original consciousness for everyone, the cause of all causes, within the core of her heart, just as the east becomes beautiful by carrying the rising moon.",
        "purport": " As indicated here by the word manasta\u1e25, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was transferred from the core of Vasudeva\u2019s mind or heart to the core of the heart of Devak\u012b. We should note carefully that the Lord was transferred to Devak\u012b not by the ordinary way for a human being, but by d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101, initiation. Thus the importance of initiation is mentioned here. Unless one is initiated by the right person, who always carries within his heart the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot acquire the power to carry the Supreme Godhead within the core of one\u2019s own heart. The word acyut\u0101\u1e41\u015bam is used because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is \u1e63a\u1e0d-ai\u015bvarya-p\u016br\u1e47a, full in the opulences of wealth, strength, fame, knowledge, beauty and renunciation. The Supreme Godhead is never separated from His personal opulences. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.39), r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan: the Lord is always situated with all His plenary expansions, such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha and Var\u0101ha. Therefore the word acyut\u0101\u1e41\u015bam is specifically used here, signifying that the Lord is always present with His plenary expansions and opulences. There is no need to think of the Lord artificially as yog\u012bs do. Dhy\u0101n\u0101vasthita-tad-gatena manas\u0101 pa\u015byanti ya\u1e41 yogina\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 12.13.1). Yog\u012bs meditate upon the Supreme Person within the mind. For a devotee, however, the Lord is present, and His presence need only be awakened through initiation by a bona fide spiritual master. The Lord did not need to live within the womb of Devak\u012b, for His presence within the core of her heart was sufficient to carry Him. One is here forbidden to think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was begotten by Vasudeva within the womb of Devak\u012b and that she carried the child within her womb. When Vasudeva was sustaining the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, he appeared just like the glowing sun, whose shining rays are always unbearable and scorching to the common man. The form of the Lord situated in the pure, unalloyed heart of Vasudeva is not different from the original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The appearance of the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a anywhere, and specifically within the heart, is called dh\u0101ma. Dh\u0101ma refers not only to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form, but to His name, His form, His quality and His paraphernalia. Everything becomes manifest simultaneously. Thus the eternal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with full potencies was transferred from the mind of Vasudeva to the mind of Devak\u012b, exactly as the setting sun\u2019s rays are transferred to the full moon rising in the east. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, entered the body of Devak\u012b from the body of Vasudeva. He was beyond the conditions of the ordinary living entity. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is there, it is to be understood that all His plenary expansions, such as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and incarnations like Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha and Var\u0101ha, are with Him, and they are not subject to the conditions of material existence. In this way, Devak\u012b became the residence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is one without a second and the cause of all creation. Devak\u012b became the residence of the Absolute Truth, but because she was within the house of Ka\u1e41sa, she looked just like a suppressed fire, or like misused education. When fire is covered by the walls of a pot or is kept in a jug, the illuminating rays of the fire cannot be very much appreciated. Similarly, misused knowledge, which does not benefit the people in general, is not very much appreciated. So Devak\u012b was kept within the prison walls of Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s palace, and no one could see her transcendental beauty, which resulted from her conceiving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Commenting upon this verse, \u015ar\u012b V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya writes: vasudeva-devak\u012b ja\u1e6dharayor h\u1e5bdayayor bhagavata\u1e25 sambandha\u1e25. The Supreme Lord\u2019s entrance into the womb of Devak\u012b from the heart of Vasudeva was a heart-to-heart relationship."

        "translation": "Devak\u012b then kept within herself the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the foundation of the entire cosmos, but because she was under arrest in the house of Ka\u1e41sa, she was like the flames of a fire covered by the walls of a pot, or like a person who has knowledge but cannot distribute it to the world for the benefit of human society.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word j\u00f1\u0101na-khala is most significant. Knowledge is meant for distribution. Although there is already much scientific knowledge, whenever scientists or philosophers awaken to a particular type of knowledge, they try to distribute it throughout the world, for otherwise the knowledge gradually dries up and no one benefits from it. India has the knowledge of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but unfortunately, for some reason or other, this sublime knowledge of the science of God was not distributed throughout the world, although it is meant for all of human society. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself appeared as \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and ordered all Indians to take up the cause of distributing the knowledge of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 throughout the entire world. \u201cInstruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as they are given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land.\u201d (Cc. Madhya 7.128) Although India has the sublime knowledge of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Indians have not done their proper duty of distributing it. Now, therefore, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has been set up to distribute this knowledge as it is, without distortion. Although previously there were attempts to distribute the knowledge of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, these attempts involved distortion and compromise with mundane knowledge. But now the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, without mundane compromises, is distributing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is, and people are deriving the benefits of awakening to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and becoming devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore the proper distribution of knowledge has begun by which not only will the whole world benefit, but India\u2019s glory will be magnified in human society. Ka\u1e41sa tried to arrest K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness within his house (bhojendra-gehe), with the result that Ka\u1e41sa, with all his opulences, was later vanquished. Similarly, the real knowledge of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was being choked by unscrupulous Indian leaders, with the result that India\u2019s culture, and knowledge of the Supreme were being lost. Now, however, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is spreading, the proper use of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is being attempted."

Human life is meant for God-realization, but unfortunately the materialistic civilization is stressing only the senses of the body, not understanding the living force within the body. As clearly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (dehino\u00a0\u2019smin yath\u0101 dehe), within the body is the body\u2019s proprietor, the living force, which is more important. But human society has become so fallen that instead of understanding the living force within the body, people have become busy with external things. This is a discrepancy in human duties. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has taken birth or taken shelter within the womb of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Men of Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s class, therefore, are very much afraid and are busy trying to stop this movement, especially in the Western countries. One politician has remarked that the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is spreading like an epidemic and that if not checked immediately, within ten years it may capture governmental power. There is, of course, such potency in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. As stated by authorities (Cc. \u0100di 17.22), kali-k\u0101le n\u0101ma-r\u016bpe k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-avat\u0101ra: in this age, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has appeared in the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is spreading like wildfire all over the world, and it will go on doing so. Men who are like Ka\u1e41sa are very much afraid of the movement\u2019s progress and acceptance by the younger generation, but as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could not be killed by Ka\u1e41sa, this movement cannot be checked by men of Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s class. The movement will go on increasing more and more, provided the leaders of the movement remain firmly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious by following the regulative principles and the primary activities of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra regularly."

But what would be heroic about killing a woman who, while confined in his custody, was under his shelter? Therefore, he did not want to act drastically by killing Devak\u012b. Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s enemy was within Devak\u012b\u2019s womb, but killing an enemy in such a nescient state would not be an exhibition of prowess. According to k\u1e63atriya rules, an enemy should be fought face to face and with proper weapons. Then if the enemy is killed, the victor becomes famous.

        "purport": " Ka\u1e41sa considered that if he killed his sister, while living he would be condemned by everyone, and after death he would go to the darkest region of hellish life because of his cruelty. It is said that a cruel person like a butcher is advised not to live and not to die. While living, a cruel person creates a hellish condition for his next birth, and therefore he should not live; but he is also advised not to die, because after death he must go to the darkest region of hell. Thus in either circumstance he is condemned. Ka\u1e41sa, therefore, having good sense about the science of the soul\u2019s transmigration, deliberately refrained from killing Devak\u012b. In this verse the words gant\u0101 tamo\u00a0\u2019ndha\u1e41 tanu-m\u0101nino dhruvam are very important and require extensive understanding. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, in his Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b-\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101, says, tatra tanu-m\u0101nina\u1e25 p\u0101pina iti deh\u0101tma-buddhyaiva p\u0101p\u0101bhinive\u015bo bhavati: \u201cOne who lives in the bodily concept, thinking, \u2018I am this body,\u2019 involves himself, by the very nature of this conception, in a life of sinful activities. Anyone living in such a conception is to be considered a candidate for hell.\u201d One who is in a bodily concept of life has no control over sense gratification. Such a person can do anything sinful to eat, drink, be merry and enjoy a life of sense gratification, not knowing of the soul\u2019s transmigration from one body to another. Such a person does whatever he likes, whatever he imagines, and therefore, being subject to the laws of nature, he suffers miserably again and again in different material bodies. In the bodily concept of life, a person is karm\u0101nubandha, or conditioned by karma, and as long as the mind is absorbed in karma, one must accept a material body. \u015aar\u012bra-bandha, bondage to the material body, is a source of misery (kle\u015ba-da). Although the body is temporary, it always gives one trouble in many ways, but human civilization is now unfortunately based on tanu-m\u0101n\u012b, the bodily concept of life, by which one thinks, \u201cI belong to this nation,\u201d \u201cI belong to this group,\u201d \u201cI belong to that group,\u201d and so on. Each of us has his own ideas, and we are becoming increasingly involved, individually, socially, communally and nationally, in the complexities of karm\u0101nubandha, sinful activities. For the maintenance of the body, men are killing so many other bodies and becoming implicated in karm\u0101nubandha. Therefore \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that tanu-m\u0101n\u012b, those in the bodily concept of life, are p\u0101p\u012b, sinful persons. For such sinful persons, the ultimate destination is the darkest region of hellish life (gant\u0101 tamo\u00a0\u2019ndham). In particular, a person who wants to maintain his body by killing animals is most sinful and cannot understand the value of spiritual life. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.19-20) the Lord says: \u201cThose who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life. Attaining repeated birth among the species of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.\u201d A human being is meant to understand the value of human life, which is a boon obtained after many, many births. Therefore one must free oneself from tanu-m\u0101n\u012b, the bodily concept of life, and realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

In other words, by thinking of his all-pervading enemy, Ka\u1e41sa became unfavorably K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has described the finest pattern of devotional service as \u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu\u015b\u012blanam, or cultivating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness favorably. Ka\u1e41sa, of course, was also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, but because he regarded K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his enemy, even though he was fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness was not favorable for his existence. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, favorably cultivated, makes one completely happy, so much so that a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not consider kaivalya-sukham, or merging into the existence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, to be a great gain. Kaivalya\u1e41 narak\u0101yate. For a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, even merging into the existence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Brahman, as impersonalists aspire to do, is uncomfortable.

Karm\u012bs hanker to be promoted to the heavenly planets, but a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person considers such promotion a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, good for nothing. Durd\u0101ntendriya-k\u0101la-sarpa-pa\u1e6dal\u012b protkh\u0101ta-da\u1e41\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101yate. Yog\u012bs try to control their senses and thus become happy, but a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person neglects the methods of yoga. He is unconcerned with the greatest of enemies, the senses, which are compared to snakes. For a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person who is cultivating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness favorably, the happiness conceived by the karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs is treated as less than a fig. Ka\u1e41sa, however, because of cultivating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in a different way \u2014 that is, inimically \u2014 was uncomfortable in all the affairs of his life; whether sitting, sleeping, walking or eating, he was always in danger. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. A nondevotee or atheist also cultivates God consciousness \u2014 by trying to avoid God in everything. For example, so-called scientists who want to create life by a combination of chemicals regard the external, material elements as supreme. Such scientists do not like the idea that life is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. As clearly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25), the living entities do not arise from a combination of material elements, such as earth, water, air and fire, but are separated portions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one can understand the position of the living entity as a separated portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by studying the nature of the living entity one can understand the nature of the Supreme Godhead, since the living entity is a fragmental sample of the Godhead. But because atheists are not interested in God consciousness, they try to be happy by cultivating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in various unfavorable ways. Although Ka\u1e41sa was always absorbed in thoughts of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was not happy. A devotee, however, whether sitting on a throne or beneath a tree, is always happy. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b resigned from office as a government minister to sit beneath a tree, yet he was happy. Tyaktv\u0101 t\u016br\u1e47am a\u015be\u1e63a-ma\u1e47\u1e0dalapati-\u015bre\u1e47\u012b\u1e41 sad\u0101 tucchavat (\u1e62a\u1e0d-gosv\u0101my-a\u1e63\u1e6daka 4). He did not care for his comfortable position as minister; he was happy even beneath a tree in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, favorably serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. For a nondevotee, the world is full of problems, whereas for a devotee the entire world is full of happiness. This comfortable position of a devotee can be established by the mercy of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Yasmin sthito na du\u1e25khena guru\u1e47\u0101pi vic\u0101lyate (Bg. 6.22). Even when a devotee is superficially put into great difficulty, he is never disturbed."

V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the para\u1e41 satyam, the Supreme Truth. The Supreme Truth can be approached or understood by the supreme method, as declared by the Supreme Truth: bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25 (Bg. 18.55). Bhakti, devotional service, is the only way to understand the Absolute Truth. For protection, therefore, the demigods surrender to the Supreme Truth, not to the relative truth. There are persons who worship various demigods, but the Supreme Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, declares in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.23), antavat tu phala\u1e41 te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 tad bhavaty alpa-medhas\u0101m: \u201cMen of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary.\u201d Worship of demigods may be useful for a limited time, but the result is antavat, perishable. This material world is impermanent, the demigods are impermanent, and the benedictions derived from the demigods are also impermanent, whereas the living entity is eternal (nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13)). Every living entity, therefore, must search for eternal happiness, not temporary happiness. The words satya\u1e41 para\u1e41 dh\u012bmahi indicate that one should search for the Absolute Truth, not the relative truth. While offering prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said: Generally it is understood that the protectors for a child are his parents, but this is not actually the fact. The real protector is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If neglected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a child, despite the presence of his parents, will suffer, and a diseased person, despite all medical help, will die. In this material world, where there is a struggle for existence, men have invented many means for protection, but these are useless if the Supreme Personality of Godhead rejects them. Therefore the demigods purposefully say, saty\u0101tmaka\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 prapann\u0101\u1e25: \u201cReal protection can be obtained from You, O Lord, and therefore we surrender unto You.\u201d The Lord demands that one surrender unto Him (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja), and He further says: \u201cIf one surrenders unto Me sincerely, saying,\u00a0\u2018My Lord, from this day I am fully surrendered unto You,\u2019 I always give him protection. That is My vow.\u201d (R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, Yuddha-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da 18.33) The demigods offered their prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He had now appeared in the womb of His devotee Devak\u012b to protect all the devotees harassed by Ka\u1e41sa and his lieutenants. Thus the Lord acts as satyavrata. The protection given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be compared to the protection given by the demigods. It is said that R\u0101va\u1e47a was a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva, but when Lord R\u0101macandra went to kill him, Lord \u015aiva could not give him protection. Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, accompanied by great sages like N\u0101rada and followed by many other demigods, had now invisibly appeared in the house of Ka\u1e41sa. They began to pray for the Supreme Personality of Godhead in select prayers which are very pleasing to the devotees and which award fulfillment of devotional desires. The first words they spoke acclaimed that the Lord is true to His vow. As stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends upon this material world just to protect the pious and destroy the impious. That is His vow. The demigods could understand that the Lord had taken His residence within the womb of Devak\u012b to fulfill this vow. They were very glad that the Lord was appearing to fulfill His mission, and they addressed Him as satya\u1e41 param, or the Supreme Absolute Truth. Everyone is searching after the truth. That is the philosophical way of life. The demigods give information that the Supreme Absolute Truth is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who becomes fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious can attain the Absolute Truth. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Absolute Truth. Relative truth is not truth in all the three phases of eternal time. Time is divided into past, present and future. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Truth always, past, present and future. In the material world, everything is being controlled by supreme time, in the course of past, present and future. But before the creation, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was existing, and when there is creation, everything is resting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when this creation is finished, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will remain. Therefore, He is Absolute Truth in all circumstances. If there is any truth within this material world, it emanates from the Supreme Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If there is any opulence within this material world, the cause of the opulence is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If there is any reputation within this material world, the cause of the reputation is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If there is any strength within this material world, the cause of such strength is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If there is any wisdom and education within this material world, the cause of such wisdom and education is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of all relative truths. Devotees, therefore, following in the footsteps of Lord Brahm\u0101, pray, govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi, worshiping the \u0101di-puru\u1e63a, the supreme truth, Govinda. Everything, everywhere, is performed in terms of three principles, j\u00f1\u0101na-bala-kriy\u0101 \u2014 knowledge, strength and activity. In every field, if there is not full knowledge, full strength and full activity, an endeavor is never successful. Therefore, if one wants success in everything, one must be backed by these three principles. In the Vedas (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.8) there is this statement about the Supreme Personality of Godhead: The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not need to do anything personally, for He has such potencies that anything He wants done will be done perfectly well through the control of material nature (sv\u0101bh\u0101vik\u012b j\u00f1\u0101na-bala-kriy\u0101 ca). Similarly, those who are engaged in the service of the Lord are not meant to struggle for existence. The devotees who are fully engaged in spreading the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, more than ten thousand men and women all over the world, have no steady or permanent occupation, yet we actually see that they are maintained very opulently. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.22): \u201cFor those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form, I carry to them what they lack and preserve what they have.\u201d The devotees have no anxiety over what will happen next, where they will stay or what they will eat, for everything is maintained and supplied by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has promised, kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.\u201d (Bg. 9.31) From all angles of vision, therefore, in all circumstances, if one fully surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question of one\u2019s struggling for existence. In this connection, the commentary by \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, who quotes from the Tantra-bh\u0101gavata, is very meaningful: Explaining the words satyasya yonim, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the avat\u0101r\u012b, the origin of all incarnations. All incarnations are the Absolute Truth, yet the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all incarnations. D\u012bp\u0101rcir eva hi da\u015b\u0101ntaram abhyupetya d\u012bp\u0101yate (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.46). There may be many lamps, all equal in power, yet there is a first lamp, a second lamp, a third lamp and so on. Similarly, there are many incarnations, who are compared to lamps, but the first lamp, the original Personality of Godhead, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi. The demigods must offer worship in obedience to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but one might argue that since the Supreme Godhead was within the womb of Devak\u012b, He was also coming in a material body. Why then should He be worshiped? Why should one make a distinction between an ordinary living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead? These questions are answered in the following verses."

        "translation": "The body [the total body and the individual body are of the same composition] may figuratively be called \u201cthe original tree.\u201d From this tree, which fully depends on the ground of material nature, come two kinds of fruit \u2014 the enjoyment of happiness and the suffering of distress. The cause of the tree, forming its three roots, is association with the three modes of material nature \u2014 goodness, passion and ignorance. The fruits of bodily happiness have four tastes \u2014 religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation \u2014 which are experienced through five senses for acquiring knowledge in the midst of six circumstances: lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst. The seven layers of bark covering the tree are skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen, and the eight branches of the tree are the five gross and three subtle elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. The tree of the body has nine hollows \u2014 the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the rectum and the genitals \u2014 and ten leaves, the ten airs passing through the body. In this tree of the body there are two birds: one is the individual soul, and the other is the Supersoul.",
        "purport": " This material world is composed of five principal elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air and ether \u2014 all of which are emanations from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although materialistic scientists may accept these five primary elements as the cause of the material manifestation, these elements in their gross and subtle states are produced by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whose marginal potency also produces the living entities working within this material world. The Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 clearly states that the entire cosmic manifestation is a combination of two of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energies \u2014 the superior energy and the inferior energy. The living entities are the superior energy, and the inanimate material elements are His inferior energy. In the dormant stage, everything rests in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Material scientists cannot give such a thorough analysis of the material structure of the body. The analysis of the material scientists concerns itself only with inanimate matter, but this is inadequate because the living entity is completely separate from the material bodily structure. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.5) the Lord says: \u201cBesides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all the living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.\u201d Although the material elements emanate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they are separated elements and are sustained by the living elements. As indicated by the word dvi-khaga\u1e25, the living elements within the body resemble two birds in a tree. Kha means \u201csky,\u201d and ga means \u201cone who flies.\u201d Thus the word dvi-khaga\u1e25 refers to birds. In the tree of the body there are two birds, or two living elements, and they are always different. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.3), the Lord says, k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a\u1e41 c\u0101pi m\u0101\u1e41 viddhi sarva-k\u1e63etre\u1e63u bh\u0101rata: \u201cO scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies.\u201d The k\u1e63etra j\u00f1a, the owner of the body, is also called the khaga, the living entity. Within the body there are two such k\u1e63etra j\u00f1as \u2014 the individual soul and the Supersoul. The individual soul is the owner of his individual body, but the Supersoul is present within the bodies of all living entities. Such a thorough analysis and understanding of the bodily structure cannot be obtained anywhere but in the Vedic literature. When two birds enter a tree, one may foolishly think that the birds become one or merge with the tree, but actually they do not. Rather, each bird keeps its individual identity. Similarly, the individual soul and the Supersoul do not become one, nor do they merge with matter. The living entity lives close to matter, but this does not mean that he merges or mixes with it (asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25), although material scientists mistakenly see the organic and inorganic, or animate and inanimate, to be mixed. Vedic knowledge has been kept imprisoned or concealed, but every human being needs to understand it in truth. The modern civilization of ignorance is simply engaged in analyzing the body, and thus people come to the erroneous conclusion that the living force within the body is generated under certain material conditions. People have no information of the soul, but this verse gives the perfect explanation that there are two living forces (dvi-khaga): the individual soul and the Supersoul. The Supersoul is present in every body (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be\u00a0\u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati), whereas the individual soul is situated only in his own body (deh\u012b) and is transmigrating from one body to another."

You are also the maintainer of this material world, and after annihilation You are the one in whom everything is conserved. Those who are covered by Your external energy cannot see You behind this manifestation, but theirs is not the vision of learned devotees.",
        "purport": " Various demigods, beginning from Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and even Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, are supposed to be the creator, maintainer and annihilator of this material world, but actually they are not. The fact is that everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, manifested in varieties of energy. Ekam ev\u0101dvit\u012bya\u1e41 brahma. There is no second existence. Those who are truly vipa\u015bcit, learned, are those who have reached the platform of understanding and observing the Supreme Personality of Godhead in any condition of life. Prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa\u1e25 sadaiva h\u1e5bdaye\u1e63u vilokayanti (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.38). Learned devotees accept even conditions of distress as representing the presence of the Supreme Lord. When a devotee is in distress, he sees that the Lord has appeared as distress just to relieve or purify the devotee from the contamination of the material world. While one is within this material world, one is in various conditions, and therefore a devotee sees a condition of distress as but another feature of the Lord. Tat te \u2019nukamp\u0101\u1e41 susam\u012bk\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.8). A devotee, therefore, regards distress as a great favor of the Lord because he understands that he is being cleansed of contamination. Te\u1e63\u0101m aha\u1e41 samuddhart\u0101 m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-s\u0101gar\u0101t (Bg. 12.7). The appearance of distress is a negative process intended to give the devotee relief from this material world, which is called m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra, or the constant repetition of birth and death. To save a surrendered soul from repeated birth and death, the Lord purifies him of contamination by offering him a little distress. This cannot be understood by a nondevotee, but a devotee can see this because he is vipa\u015bcit, or learned. A nondevotee, therefore, is perturbed in distress, but a devotee welcomes distress as another feature of the Lord. Sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma. A devotee can actually see that there is only the Supreme Personality of Godhead and no second entity. Ekam ev\u0101dvit\u012byam. There is only the Lord, who presents Himself in different energies. Persons who are not in real knowledge think that Brahm\u0101 is the creator, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u the maintainer and \u015aiva the annihilator and that the different demigods are intended to fulfill diverse purposes. Thus they create diverse purposes and worship various demigods to have these purposes fulfilled (k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante\u00a0\u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25). A devotee, however, knows that these various demigods are but different parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that these parts need not be worshiped. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.23): \u201cWhatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunt\u012b, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding.\u201d There is no need to worship the demigods, for this is avidhi, not in order. Simply by surrendering oneself at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can completely discharge one\u2019s duties; there is no need to worship various deities or demigods. These various divinities are observed by the m\u016b\u1e0dhas, fools, who are bewildered by the three modes of material nature (tribhir gu\u1e47amayair bh\u0101vair ebhi\u1e25 sarvam ida\u1e41 jagat). Such fools cannot understand that the real source of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (mohita\u1e41 n\u0101bhij\u0101n\u0101ti m\u0101m ebhya\u1e25 param avyayam). Not being disturbed by the Lord\u2019s various features, one should concentrate upon and worship the Supreme Lord (m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). This should be the guiding principle of one\u2019s life."

By this simple process, one can cross the ocean of nescience as easily as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf.",
        "purport": " The true mission in life is to cross the ocean of nescience, of repeated birth and death. Those in the darkness of ignorance, however, do not know this mission. Instead, being carried away by the waves of material nature (prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 karm\u0101\u1e47i sarva\u015ba\u1e25), they are undergoing the tribulations of m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani, repeated birth and death. But persons who have achieved knowledge by the association of devotees follow the mah\u0101janas (mahat-k\u1e5btena). Such a person always concentrates his mind upon the lotus feet of the Lord and executes one or more of the nine varieties of devotional service (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam). Simply by this process, one can cross the insurmountable ocean of nescience. Devotional service is powerful in any form. \u015ar\u012b-vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 \u015brava\u1e47e par\u012bk\u1e63id abhavad vaiy\u0101saki\u1e25 k\u012brtane (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.265). According to this verse, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it became liberated by fully concentrating his mind on hearing the Lord\u2019s holy name, attributes and pastimes. Similarly, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b simply glorified the Lord, and by speaking on the subject matters of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that constitute the entire \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, he too was liberated. One may also be liberated simply by sakhya, friendly behavior with the Lord. Such is the power of devotional service, as we learn from the examples set by the Lord\u2019s many pure devotees. We have to follow in the footsteps of such devotees, for by this one easy process one can cross the great ocean of nescience just as one might cross a small hole created by the hoof of a calf. Here the Lord is described as ambuj\u0101k\u1e63a, or lotus-eyed. By seeing the eyes of the Lord, which are compared to lotus flowers, one becomes so satisfied that one does not want to turn his eyes to anything else. Simply by seeing the transcendental form of the Lord, a devotee is at once fully absorbed in the Lord in his heart. This absorption is called sam\u0101dhi. Dhy\u0101n\u0101vasthita-tad-gatena manas\u0101 pa\u015byanti ya\u1e41 yogina\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 12.13.1). A yog\u012b is fully absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for he has no other business than to think of the Lord always within the heart. It is also said: \u201cFor one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mur\u0101ri, the enemy of the demon Mura, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf\u2019s hoofprint. His goal is para\u1e41 padam, or Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, the place where there are no material miseries, not the place where there is danger at every step.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.58) This process is recommended here by authorities like Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva (svayambh\u016br n\u0101rada\u1e25 \u015bambhu\u1e25), and therefore we must take to this process in order to transcend nescience. This is very easy, but we must follow in the footsteps of great personalities, and then success will be possible. In regard to the word mahat-k\u1e5btena, it is also significant that the process shown by great devotees is not only for them but also for others. If things are made easy, this affords facility for the person who has made them easy and also for others who follow the same principles. The process recommended in this verse for crossing the ocean of nescience is easy not only for the devotee but also for common persons who follow the devotee (mah\u0101jano yena gata\u1e25 sa panth\u0101\u1e25)."

When \u0101c\u0101ryas completely take shelter under Your lotus feet in order to cross the fierce ocean of nescience, they leave behind on earth the method by which they cross, and because You are very merciful to Your other devotees, You accept this method to help them.",
        "purport": " This statement reveals how the merciful \u0101c\u0101ryas and the merciful Supreme Personality of Godhead together help the serious devotee who wants to return home, back to Godhead. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in His teachings to R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, said: One can achieve the seed of bhakti-lat\u0101, devotional service, by the mercy of guru and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The duty of the guru is to find the means, according to the time, the circumstances and the candidate, by which one can be induced to render devotional service, which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a accepts from a candidate who wants to be successful in going back home, back to Godhead. After wandering throughout the universe, a fortunate person within this material world seeks shelter of such a guru, or \u0101c\u0101rya, who trains the devotee in the suitable ways to render service according to the circumstances so that the Supreme Personality of Godhead will accept the service. This makes it easier for the candidate to reach the ultimate destination. The \u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s duty, therefore, is to find the means by which devotees may render service according to references from \u015b\u0101stra. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, for example, in order to help subsequent devotees, published such devotional books as Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu. Thus it is the duty of the \u0101c\u0101rya to publish books that will help future candidates take up the method of service and become eligible to return home, back to Godhead, by the mercy of the Lord. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, this same path is being prescribed and followed. Thus the devotees have been advised to refrain from four sinful activities \u2014 illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling \u2014 and to chant sixteen rounds a day. These are bona fide instructions. Because in the Western countries constant chanting is not possible, one should not artificially imitate Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, but should follow this method. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will accept a devotee who strictly follows the regulative principles and the method prescribed in the various books and literatures published by the authorities. The \u0101c\u0101rya gives the suitable method for crossing the ocean of nescience by accepting the boat of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, and if this method is strictly followed, the followers will ultimately reach the destination, by the grace of the Lord. This method is called \u0101c\u0101rya samprad\u0101ya. It is therefore said, samprad\u0101ya-vih\u012bn\u0101 ye mantr\u0101s te ni\u1e63phal\u0101 mat\u0101\u1e25 (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a). The \u0101c\u0101rya samprad\u0101ya is strictly bona fide. Therefore one must accept the \u0101c\u0101rya samprad\u0101ya; otherwise one\u2019s endeavor will be futile. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore sings: One must worship the lotus feet of the \u0101c\u0101rya and live within the society of devotees. Then one\u2019s endeavor to cross over nescience will surely be successful."

        "purport": " Aside from devotees, there are many others, nondevotees, known as karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs or yog\u012bs, philanthropists, altruists, politicians, impersonalists and voidists. There are many varieties of nondevotees who have their respective ways of liberation, but simply because they do not know the shelter of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, although they falsely think that they have been liberated and elevated to the highest position, they fall down. As clearly stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.3): \u201cThose who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter whether one is a karm\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, yog\u012b, philanthropist, politician or whatever; if one has no love for the lotus feet of the Lord, one falls down. That is the verdict given by Lord Brahm\u0101 in this verse. There are persons who advocate accepting any process and who say that whatever process one accepts will lead to the same goal, but that is refuted in this verse, where such persons are referred to as vimukta-m\u0101nina\u1e25, signifying that although they think they have attained the highest perfection, in fact they have not. In the present day, big, big politicians all over the world think that by scheming they can occupy the highest political post, that of president or prime minister, but we actually see that even in this life such big prime ministers, presidents and other politicians, because of being nondevotees, fall down (patanty adha\u1e25). To become president or prime minister is not easy; one must work very hard (\u0101ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a) to achieve the post. And even though one may reach his goal, at any moment one may be kicked down by material nature. In human society there have been many instances in which great, exalted politicians have fallen from government and become lost in historical oblivion. The cause of this is avi\u015buddha-buddhaya\u1e25: their intelligence is impure. The \u015b\u0101stra says, na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um (Bh\u0101g. 7.5.31). One achieves the perfection of life by becoming a devotee of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but people do not know this. Therefore, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (12.5), kle\u015bo\u00a0\u2019dhikataras te\u1e63\u0101m avyakt\u0101sakta-cetas\u0101m. Persons who do not ultimately accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead and take to devotional service, but who instead are attached to impersonalism and voidism, must undergo great labor to achieve their goals. To achieve understanding, such persons work very hard and undergo severe austerities, but their hard labor and austerities themselves are their only achievement, for they do not actually achieve the real goal of life. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja at first wanted to achieve the greatest material kingdom and greater material possessions than his father, but when he was actually favored by the Lord, who appeared before him to give him the benediction he desired, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja refused it, saying, sv\u0101min k\u1e5bt\u0101rtho \u2019smi vara\u1e41 na y\u0101ce: \u201cNow I am fully satisfied. I do not want any material benediction.\u201d (Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya 7.28) This is the perfection of life. Ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101 c\u0101para\u1e41 l\u0101bha\u1e41 manyate n\u0101dhika\u1e41 tata\u1e25 (Bg. 6.22). If one achieves the shelter of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, one is fully satisfied and does not need to ask for any material benediction. At night, no one can see a lotus, for lotuses blossom only during the daytime. Therefore the word aravind\u0101k\u1e63a is significant. One who is not captivated by the lotus eyes or transcendental form of the Supreme Lord is in darkness, exactly like one who cannot see a lotus. One who has not come to the point of seeing the lotus eyes and transcendental form of \u015ay\u0101masundara is a failure. Prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa\u1e25 sadaiva h\u1e5bdaye\u1e63u vilokayanti. Those who are attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in love always see the Lord\u2019s lotus eyes and lotus feet, whereas others cannot see the Lord\u2019s beauty and are therefore classified as an\u0101d\u1e5bta-yu\u1e63mad-a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25, or neglectful of the Lord\u2019s personal form. Those who neglect the Lord\u2019s form are surely failures on every path in life, but if one develops even a little love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is liberated without difficulty (svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t). Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead recommends in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.34), man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru: \u201cSimply think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer some slight homage to Me.\u201d Simply by this process, one is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead, and thus attain the highest perfection. The Lord further affirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54-55): \u201cOne who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me. One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d"

        "translation": "O M\u0101dhava, Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the goddess of fortune, if devotees completely in love with You sometimes fall from the path of devotion, they do not fall like nondevotees, for You still protect them. Thus they fearlessly traverse the heads of their opponents and continue to progress in devotional service.",
        "purport": " Devotees generally do not fall down, but if circumstantially they do, the Lord, because of their strong attachment to Him, gives them protection in all circumstances. Thus even if devotees fall down, they are still strong enough to traverse the heads of their enemies. We have actually seen that our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has many opponents, such as the \u201cdeprogrammers,\u201d who instituted a strong legal case against the devotees. We thought that this case would take a long time to settle, but because the devotees were protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we unexpectedly won the case in one day. Thus a case that was expected to continue for years was settled in a day because of the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has promised in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.31), kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.\u201d In history there are many instances of devotees like Citraketu, Indradyumna and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata who circumstantially fell down but were still protected. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata, for example, because of his attachment to a deer, thought of the deer at the time of death, and therefore in his next life he became a deer (ya\u1e41 ya\u1e41 v\u0101pi smaran bh\u0101va\u1e41 tyajaty ante kalevaram). Because of protection by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, the deer remembered his relationship with the Lord and next took birth in a good brahminical family and performed devotional service (\u015buc\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 \u015br\u012bmat\u0101\u1e41 gehe yoga-bhra\u1e63\u1e6do\u00a0\u2019bhij\u0101yate). Similarly, Citraketu fell down and became a demon, V\u1e5btr\u0101sura, but he too was protected. Thus even if one falls down from the path of bhakti-yoga, one is ultimately saved. If a devotee is strongly situated in devotional service, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has promised to protect him (kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati). But even if a devotee circumstantially falls down, he is protected by M\u0101dhava. The word M\u0101dhava is significant. M\u0101, mother Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the mother of all opulences, is always with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and if a devotee is in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all the opulences of the Lord are ready to help him. Wherever there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His devotee Arjuna, P\u0101rtha, there is victory, opulence, extraordinary power and morality. The opulences of a devotee are not a result of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da-vic\u0101ra. A devotee is always protected by all of the Supreme Lord\u2019s opulences, of which no one can deprive him (te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 nity\u0101bhiyukt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 yoga-k\u1e63ema\u1e41 vah\u0101my aham). Thus a devotee cannot be defeated by any opponents. A devotee, therefore, should not deviate knowingly from the path of devotion. The adherent devotee is assured all protection from the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Thus You are worshiped by the Vedic principles.",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.3), yaj\u00f1a-d\u0101na-tapa\u1e25-karma na ty\u0101jyam: the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, charity, austerity and all such prescribed duties are never to be given up. Yaj\u00f1o d\u0101na\u1e41 tapa\u015b caiva p\u0101van\u0101ni man\u012b\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101m (18.5): even one who is very much advanced in spiritual realization must still execute the Vedic principles. Even in the lowest stage, the karm\u012bs are advised to work for the sake of the Lord. \u201cWork done as a sacrifice for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world.\u201d (Bg. 3.9) The words yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47a\u1e25 indicate that while performing all kinds of duties, one should remember that these duties should be performed to satisfy the Supreme Lord (sva-karma\u1e47\u0101 tam abhyarcya). According to Vedic principles, there must be divisions of human society (c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam). There should be br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras, and everyone should learn to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead (tam abhyarcya). This is real human society, and without this system we are left with animal society. The modern activities of human society are described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as the activities of go-khara, cows and asses (sa eva go-khara\u1e25). Everyone is acting in a bodily concept of life involving society, friendship and love for the improvement of economic and political conditions, and thus all activities are enacted in ignorance. The Supreme Personality therefore comes to teach us how to act according to the Vedic principles. In this Age of Kali, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and preached that in this age the Vedic activities cannot be systematically performed because people are so fallen. He gave this recommendation from the \u015b\u0101stras: \u201cIn this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.\u201d The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore teaching people all over the world how to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, and this has proved very much effective in all places at all times. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in order to teach us Vedic principles intended for understanding Him (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). We should always know that when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord Caitanya appeared, They appeared in \u015buddha-sattva bodies. One should not mistake the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu to be a material body like ours, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu appeared as needed for the benefit of the entire human society. Out of causeless mercy, the Lord appears in different ages in His original \u015buddha-sattva transcendental body to elevate human society to the spiritual platform upon which they can truly benefit. Unfortunately, modern politicians and other leaders stress the bodily comforts of life (yasy\u0101tma-buddhi\u1e25 ku\u1e47ape tri-dh\u0101tuke) and concentrate on the activities of this ism and that ism, which they describe in different kinds of flowery language. Essentially such activities are the activities of animals (sa eva go-khara\u1e25). We should learn how to act from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which explains everything for human understanding. Thus we can become happy even in this Age of Kali."

        "translation": "O Lord, cause of all causes, if Your transcendental body were not beyond the modes of material nature, one could not understand the difference between matter and transcendence. Only by Your presence can one understand the transcendental nature of Your Lordship, who are the controller of material nature. Your transcendental nature is very difficult to understand unless one is influenced by the presence of Your transcendental form.",
        "purport": " It is said, traigu\u1e47ya-vi\u1e63ay\u0101 ved\u0101 nistraigu\u1e47yo bhav\u0101rjuna. Unless one is situated in transcendence, one cannot understand the transcendental nature of the Lord. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.29): Only by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can one understand Him. Those who are in the modes of material nature, although speculating for thousands of years, cannot understand Him. The Lord has innumerable forms (r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan), and unless these forms, such as Lord R\u0101macandra, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma, were transcendental, how could they be worshiped by devotees since time immemorial? Bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25 (Bg. 18.55). Devotees who awaken their transcendental nature in the presence of the Lord and who follow the rules and regulations of devotional service can understand Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord R\u0101macandra and other incarnations, who are not of this material world but who come from the spiritual world for the benefit of people in general. If one does not take to this process, one imagines or manufactures some form of God according to material qualities and can never awaken a real understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25 signify that unless one worships the Lord according to the regulative devotional principles, one cannot awaken the transcendental nature. Deity worship, even in the absence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, awakens the transcendental nature of the devotee, who thus becomes increasingly attached to the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. The appearance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the answer to all imaginative iconography of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone imagines the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to his mode of material nature. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said that the Lord is the oldest person. Therefore a section of religionists imagine that God must be very old, and therefore they depict a form of the Lord like a very old man. But in the same Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, that is contradicted; although He is the oldest of all living entities, He has His eternal form as a fresh youth. The exact words used in this connection in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam are vij\u00f1\u0101nam aj\u00f1\u0101na-bhid\u0101pam\u0101rjanam. Vij\u00f1\u0101na means transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Personality; vij\u00f1\u0101na is also experienced knowledge. Transcendental knowledge has to be accepted by the descending process of disciplic succession as Brahm\u0101 presents the knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 is vij\u00f1\u0101na as realized by Brahm\u0101\u2019s transcendental experience, and in that way he presented the form and the pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the transcendental abode. Aj\u00f1\u0101na-bhid\u0101 means \u201cthat which can match all kinds of speculation.\u201d In ignorance, people are imagining the form of the Lord; sometimes He has no form and sometimes He has form, according to their different imaginations. But the presentation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 is vij\u00f1\u0101na \u2014 scientific, experienced knowledge given by Lord Brahm\u0101 and accepted by Lord Caitanya. There is no doubt about it. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s color \u2014 everything is reality. Here it is said that this vij\u00f1\u0101nam is always defeating all kinds of speculative knowledge. \u201cTherefore,\u201d the demigods prayed, \u201cwithout Your appearing as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as You are, neither aj\u00f1\u0101na-bhid\u0101 (the nescience of speculative knowledge) nor vij\u00f1\u0101nam would be realized. Aj\u00f1\u0101na-bhid\u0101pam\u0101rjanam \u2014 by Your appearance the speculative knowledge of ignorance will be vanquished, and the real, experienced knowledge of authorities like Lord Brahm\u0101 will be established. Men influenced by the three modes of material nature imagine their own God according to the modes of material nature. In this way God is presented in various ways, but Your appearance will establish what the real form of God is.\u201d The highest blunder committed by the impersonalist is to think that when the incarnation of God comes, He accepts a form of matter in the mode of goodness. Actually the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is transcendental to any material idea. Even the greatest impersonalist, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, has admitted, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 paro\u00a0\u2019vyakt\u0101t: the material creation is caused by the avyakta, the impersonal manifestation of matter or the nonphenomenal total reservoir of matter, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental to that material conception. This is expressed in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as \u015buddha-sattva, or transcendental. The Lord does not belong to the material mode of goodness, for He is above the position of material goodness. He belongs to the transcendental, eternal status of bliss and knowledge. \u201cDear Lord,\u201d the demigods prayed, \u201cwhen You appear in Your different incarnations, You take different names and forms according to different situations. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Your name because You are all-attractive; You are called \u015ay\u0101masundara because of Your transcendental beauty. \u015ay\u0101ma means blackish, yet they say that You are more beautiful than thousands of cupids. Kandarpa-ko\u1e6di-kaman\u012bya. Although You appear in a color which is compared to that of a blackish cloud, You are the transcendental Absolute, and therefore Your beauty is many, many times more attractive than the delicate body of Cupid. Sometimes You are called Giridh\u0101r\u012b because You lifted the hill known as Govardhana. You are sometimes called Nanda-nandana or V\u0101sudeva or Devak\u012b-nandana because You appear as the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda or Devak\u012b or Vasudeva. Impersonalists think that Your many names or forms are according to a particular type of work and quality because they accept You from the position of a material observer. \u201cOur dear Lord, the way of understanding is not to study Your absolute nature, form and activities by mental speculation. One must engage himself in devotional service; then one can understand Your absolute nature and Your transcendental form, name and quality. Actually, only a person who has a little taste for the service of Your lotus feet can understand Your transcendental nature or form and quality. Others may go on speculating for millions of years, but it is not possible for them to understand even a single part of Your actual position.\u201d In other words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, cannot be understood by the nondevotees because there is a curtain of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 which covers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s actual features. As confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.25), n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sarvasya. The Lord says, \u201cI am not exposed to anyone and everyone.\u201d When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came, He was actually present on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, and everyone saw Him. But not everyone could understand that He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Still, everyone who died in His presence attained complete liberation from material bondage and was transferred to the spiritual world. Because foolish m\u016b\u1e0dhas do not awaken their spiritual nature, they do not understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or R\u0101ma (avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam). Even big academic scholars, not considering the endeavors of the \u0101c\u0101ryas who have recommended devotional service in many elaborate commentaries and notes, think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fictitious. This is due to a lack of transcendental knowledge and a failure to awaken K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should have the common sense to ask why, if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or R\u0101ma were fictitious, stalwart scholars like \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, V\u012brar\u0101ghava, Vijayadhvaja, Vallabh\u0101c\u0101rya and many other recognized \u0101c\u0101ryas would have spent so much time to write about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in notes and commentaries on \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

        "translation": "O Lord, Your transcendental name and form are not ascertained by those who merely speculate on the path of imagination. Your name, form and attributes can be ascertained only through devotional service.",
        "purport": " As stated in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cOne cannot understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality and pastimes of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through one\u2019s materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him.\u201d Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His transcendental name, form and activities are all of a transcendental nature, ordinary persons or those who are only slightly advanced cannot understand them. Even big scholars who are nondevotees think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fictitious. Yet although so-called scholars and commentators do not believe that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was factually a historical person whose presence on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra is recorded in the history of Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, they feel compelled to write commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and other historical records. Sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau svayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental name, form, attributes and activities can be revealed only when one engages in His service in full consciousness. This confirms K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s own words in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55): \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d Only by sevonmukha, by engaging oneself in the Lord\u2019s service, can one realize the name, form and qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u201cO Lord,\u201d the demigods say, \u201cthe impersonalists, who are nondevotees, cannot understand that Your name is identical with Your form.\u201d Since the Lord is absolute, there is no difference between His name and His actual form. In the material world there is a difference between form and name. The mango fruit is different from the name of the mango. One cannot taste the mango fruit simply by chanting, \u201cMango, mango, mango.\u201d But the devotee who knows that there is no difference between the name and the form of the Lord chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, and realizes that he is always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s company. For persons who are not very advanced in absolute knowledge of the Supreme, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibits His transcendental pastimes. They can simply think of the pastimes of the Lord and get the full benefit. Since there is no difference between the transcendental name and form of the Lord, there is no difference between the transcendental pastimes and the form of the Lord. For those who are less intelligent (like women, laborers or the mercantile class), the great sage Vy\u0101sadeva wrote Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present in His different activities. Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is history, and simply by studying, hearing, and memorizing the transcendental activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the less intelligent can also gradually rise to the standard of pure devotees. The pure devotees, who are always absorbed in the thought of the transcendental lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who are always engaged in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, are never to be considered to be in the material world. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has explained that those who are always engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by body, mind and activities are to be considered liberated even within this body. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord have already transcended the material position. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in order to give a chance to both the devotees and the nondevotees for realization of the ultimate goal of life. The devotees get the direct chance to see Him and worship Him. Those who are not on that platform get the chance to become acquainted with His activities and thus become elevated to the same position. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38) says: Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental form is presented as black, devotees who are in love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead appreciate the Lord as \u015ay\u0101masundara, having a very beautiful blackish form. The Lord\u2019s form is so beautiful that the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.30) also states: \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who plays on His transcendental flute. His eyes are like lotus flowers, He is decorated with peacock plumes, and His bodily color resembles the color of a fresh black cloud, although His bodily features are more beautiful than millions of Cupids.\u201d This beauty of the Supreme Lord can be seen by devotees who are in love with Him, devotees whose eyes are anointed with love of Godhead (prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena). The Lord is also known as Giridh\u0101r\u012b or Girivara-dh\u0101r\u012b. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for the sake of His devotees, lifted Govardhana Hill, the devotees appreciate the Lord\u2019s inconceivable strength; but nondevotees, in spite of directly perceiving the Lord\u2019s inconceivable strength and power, regard the Lord\u2019s activities as fictitious. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. Nondevotees cannot give any nomenclature for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet the Lord is known as \u015ay\u0101masundara and Giridh\u0101r\u012b. Similarly, the Lord is known as Devak\u012b-nandana and Ya\u015bod\u0101-nandana because He accepted the role of son for mother Devak\u012b and mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and He is known as Gop\u0101la because He enjoyed the sport of maintaining the cows and calves. Therefore, although He has no mundane name, He is addressed by devotees as Devak\u012b-nandana, Ya\u015bod\u0101-nandana, Gop\u0101la and \u015ay\u0101masundara. These are all transcendental names that only devotees can appreciate and nondevotees cannot. The history of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the person has been openly seen by everyone, yet only those who are in love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead can appreciate this history, whereas nondevotees, who have not developed their loving qualities, think that the activities, form and attributes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are fictitious. Therefore this verse explains, na n\u0101ma-r\u016bpe gu\u1e47a janma-karmabhir nir\u016bpitavye tava tasya s\u0101k\u1e63i\u1e47a\u1e25. In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has given the example that persons suffering from jaundice cannot taste the sweetness of sugar candy, although everyone knows that sugar candy is sweet. Similarly, because of the material disease, nondevotees cannot understand the transcendental name, form, attributes and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although they actually see the Lord\u2019s activities, either through authority or through history. The Pur\u0101\u1e47as are old, authentic histories, but nondevotees cannot understand them, especially \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which is the essence of Vedic knowledge. Nondevotees cannot understand even the preliminary study of transcendental knowledge, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. They simply speculate and present commentaries with absurd distortions. In conclusion, unless one elevates himself to the transcendental platform by practicing bhakti-yoga, one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His name, form, attributes or activities. But if by chance, by the association of devotees, one can actually understand the Lord and His features, one immediately becomes a liberated person. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has therefore said that by affection and love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, devotees can express their mind to Him with their words. Others, however, cannot do this, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25)."

        "translation": "Even while engaged in various activities, devotees whose minds are completely absorbed at Your lotus feet, and who constantly hear, chant, contemplate and cause others to remember Your transcendental names and forms, are always on the transcendental platform, and thus they can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " How bhakti-yoga can be practiced is explained in this verse. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has said that anyone who has dedicated his life to the service of the Lord (\u012bh\u0101 yasya harer d\u0101sye) by his activities, his mind and his words (karma\u1e47\u0101 manas\u0101 gir\u0101) may stay in any condition of life (nikhil\u0101sv apy avasth\u0101su) and yet is no longer actually conditioned but is liberated (j\u012bvan-mukta\u1e25 sa ucyate). Even though such a devotee is in a material body, he has nothing to do with this body, for he is transcendentally situated. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101\u1e25 sarve na kuta\u015bcana bibhyati: because a devotee is engaged in transcendental activities, he is not afraid of being materially embodied. (Bh\u0101g. 6.17.28) Illustrating this liberated position, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu prayed, mama janmani janman\u012b\u015bvare bhavat\u0101d bhaktir ahaituk\u012b tvayi: \u201cAll I want is Your causeless devotional service in My life, birth after birth.\u201d Even if a devotee, by the supreme will of the Lord, takes birth in this material world, he continues his devotional service. When King Bharata made a mistake and in his next life became a deer, his devotional service did not stop, although some slight chastisement was given to him because of his negligence. N\u0101rada Muni says that even if one falls from the platform of devotional service, he is not lost, whereas nondevotees are lost entirely because they are not engaged in service. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.14) therefore recommends that one always engage at least in chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra: \u201cAlways chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, the great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.\u201d One should not give up the process of devotional service, which is performed in nine different ways (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam, etc.). The most important process is hearing (\u015brava\u1e47am) from the guru, s\u0101dhu and \u015b\u0101stra \u2014 the spiritual master, the saintly \u0101c\u0101ryas and the Vedic literature. S\u0101dhu-\u015b\u0101stra-guru-v\u0101kya, cittete kariy\u0101 aikya. We should not hear the commentaries and explanations of nondevotees, for this is strictly forbidden by \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who quotes from the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: We should strictly follow this injunction and never try to hear from M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, impersonalists, voidists, politicians or so-called scholars. Strictly avoiding such inauspicious association, we should simply hear from pure devotees. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b therefore recommends, \u015br\u012b-guru-pad\u0101\u015braya\u1e25: one must seek shelter at the lotus feet of a pure devotee who can be one\u2019s guru. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu advises that a guru is one who strictly follows the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: yare dekha tare kaha\u00a0\u2018k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019-upade\u015ba (Cc. Madhya 7.128). A juggler, a magician or one who speaks nonsense as an academic career is not a guru. Rather, a guru is one who presents Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions, as it is. \u015arava\u1e47a is very important; one must hear from the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava s\u0101dhu, guru and \u015b\u0101stra. The word kriy\u0101su, meaning \u201cby manual labor\u201d or \u201cby work,\u201d is important in this verse. One should engage in practical service to the Lord. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, all our activities are concentrated upon distributing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a literature. This is very important. One may approach any person and induce him to read K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a literature so that in the future he also may become a devotee. Such activities are recommended in this verse. Kriy\u0101su yas tvac-cara\u1e47\u0101ravindayo\u1e25. Such activities will always remind the devotees of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. By fully concentrating on distributing books for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is sam\u0101dhi."

When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a walks on this earth or in the heavenly planets, these marks are visible wherever He goes. V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana-dh\u0101ma is a transcendental place because of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s walking on this land frequently. The inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana were fortunate to see these marks here and there. When Akr\u016bra went to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to take K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma away to the festival arranged by Ka\u1e41sa, upon seeing the marks of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet on the ground of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, he fell down and began to groan. These marks are visible to devotees who receive the causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (tav\u0101nukampit\u0101m). The demigods were jubilant not only because the appearance of the Supreme Lord would do away with the burdensome demons, but also because they would be able to see upon the ground the transcendental marks from the soles of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. The gop\u012bs always thought of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet when He was walking in the pasturing grounds, and, as described in the previous verse, simply by thinking of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, the gop\u012bs were fully absorbed in transcendence (\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e6da-cet\u0101 na bhav\u0101ya kalpate). Like the gop\u012bs, one who is always absorbed in thought of the Lord is beyond the material platform and will not remain in this material world. It is our duty, therefore, always to hear, chant and think about the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, as actually done by Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas who have decided to live in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana always and think of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet twenty-four hours a day."

Therefore Your appearance or birth in this world has no other cause than Your pleasure potency. Similarly, the living entities, who are part of You, have no cause for miseries like birth, death and old age, except when these living entities are conducted by Your external energy.",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7), mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25: the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and thus they are qualitatively one with the Lord. We can understand that when the Supreme Lord appears or disappears as an incarnation, there is no other cause than His pleasure potency. We cannot force the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear. As He says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.7): \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself.\u201d When there is a need to diminish a burden created by the demons, the Supreme Godhead can do it in many ways because He has multifarious energies. There is no need for Him to come as an incarnation, since He is not forced to do anything like ordinary living entities. The living entities come to this material world in the spirit of enjoyment, but because they want to enjoy without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-bahirmukha haiy\u0101 bhoja-v\u0101\u00f1ch\u0101 kare), they suffer birth, death, old age and disease under the control of the illusory energy. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, however, no such causes are involved; His descent is an act of His pleasure potency. We should always remember this distinction between the Lord and the ordinary living entity and not uselessly argue that the Lord cannot come. There are philosophers who do not believe in the Lord\u2019s incarnation and who ask, \u201cWhy should the Supreme Lord come?\u201d But the answer is, \u201cWhy should He not come? Why should He be controlled by the desire of the living entity?\u201d The Lord is free to do whatever He likes. Therefore this verse says, vin\u0101 vinoda\u1e41 bata tarkay\u0101mahe. It is only for His pleasure that He comes although He does not need to come. When the living entities come to this world for material enjoyment, they are entangled in karma and karma-phala by the Lord\u2019s illusory energy. But if one seeks shelter at the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, one is again situated in his original, liberated state. As stated here, k\u1e5bt\u0101 yatas tvayy abhay\u0101\u015bray\u0101tmani: one who seeks shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord is always fearless. Because we are dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we should give up the idea that without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a we can enjoy freedom in this material world. This idea is the reason we have become entangled. Now it is our duty to seek shelter again at the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. This shelter is described as abhaya, or fearless. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not subject to birth, death, old age or disease, and since we are part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we also are not subject to birth, death, old age and disease, but we have become subject to these illusory problems because of our forgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and our position as His eternal servants (j\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa\u2019). Therefore, if we practice devotional service by always thinking of the Lord, always glorifying Him and always chanting about Him, as described in text 37 (\u015b\u1e5b\u1e47van g\u1e5b\u1e47an sa\u1e41smaraya\u1e41\u015b ca cintayan), we will be reinstated in our original, constitutional position and thus be saved. The demigods, therefore, encouraged Devak\u012b not to fear Ka\u1e41sa, but to think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was already within her womb."

Then Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 led the demigods in returning to their homes. The word kuk\u1e63i-gata\u1e25, meaning \u201cwithin the womb of Devak\u012b,\u201d has been discussed by \u015ar\u012b J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Krama-sandarbha commentary. Since it was said at first that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present within the heart of Vasudeva and was transferred to the heart of Devak\u012b, \u015ar\u012b J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b writes, \u201cHow is it that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was now in the womb?\u201d He replies that there is no contradiction. From the heart the Lord can go to the womb, or from the womb He can go to the heart. Indeed, He can go or stay anywhere.

The Lord can stay wherever He likes. Devak\u012b, therefore, in accordance with the desire of her former life, now had the opportunity to seek the benediction of having the Supreme Personality of Godhead as her son, Devak\u012b-nandana."
