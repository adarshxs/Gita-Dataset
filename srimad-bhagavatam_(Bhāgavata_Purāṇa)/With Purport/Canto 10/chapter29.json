        "translation": "\u015ar\u012b B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47i said: \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, full in all opulences, yet upon seeing those autumn nights scented with blossoming jasmine flowers, He turned His mind toward loving affairs. To fulfill His purposes He employed His internal potency.",
        "purport": " As we begin the famous narration of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s r\u0101sa dance, a dance of love with beautiful young girls, questions will inevitably arise in the minds of ordinary people regarding the propriety of God\u2019s romantic dancing with many young girls in the middle of a full-moon autumn night. In his description of the Lord\u2019s r\u0101sa dance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da painstakingly explains the spiritual purity of these transcendental activities. Those advanced in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 the great teachers, or \u0101c\u0101ryas \u2014 leave no doubt that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full and satisfied in Himself, free of all material desire, which is, after all, a sense of incompleteness or lack. Materialistic persons and impersonal philosophers stubbornly reject the bona fide explanation of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental nature. There is no reason to deny the beautiful reality of an absolute person able to perform absolute romantic activities, of which our so-called romance is merely a shadow or perverted reflection. The irrational insistence that material activities cannot be a reflection of the perfect, spiritual activities performed by God reflects the unimaginative emotional disposition of those who oppose the reality of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This psychological disposition of the nondevotees, which leads them to fervently deny the very existence of the absolute person, unfortunately boils down to what may be succinctly described as envy, since the overwhelming majority of the impersonal critics eagerly pursue their own romantic affairs, which they consider quite real and even \u201cspiritual.\u201d The actual supreme lover is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra begins by declaring that the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, and even Western philosophy was born in a somewhat awkward attempt at finding the original One behind the apparent many of material existence. Conjugal love, one of the most intense and demanding aspects of human existence, can hardly have nothing at all to do with supreme reality. In fact, the conjugal love experienced by human beings is a mere reflection of spiritual reality, in which the same love exists in an absolute, pristine state. Thus it is clearly stated here that when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a decided to enjoy the romantic atmosphere of autumn, \u201cHe resorted to His spiritual potency\u201d (yoga-m\u0101y\u0101m up\u0101\u015brita\u1e25). The spiritual nature of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s conjugal affairs is a major theme in this section of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. A woman is attractive because of the sweet sound of her voice, her beauty and gentleness, her enchanting fragrance and tenderness, and also because of her cleverness and skill in music and dance. The most attractive ladies of all are the young gop\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, who are Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s internal potency, and this chapter tells how He enjoyed their brilliant feminine qualities \u2014 even though, as \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has mentioned, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was an eight-year-old boy when these events took place. Ordinary people prefer God simply to be a witness of their romantic affairs. When a boy desires a girl or a girl desires a boy, sometimes they pray to God for their enjoyment. Such people are shocked and dismayed to find out that the Lord can enjoy His own loving affairs with His own transcendental senses. In truth, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Cupid, and His exciting conjugal pastimes will be described in this section of the Bh\u0101gavatam. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends to the earth, His spiritual body seems to take birth and grow as He displays His variegated pastimes. The Lord could hardly allow His boyhood to pass without exhibiting the supreme loving affairs between a young boy and young girls. Thus Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura quotes \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as follows: kai\u015bora\u1e41 saphal\u012b-karoti kalayan ku\u00f1je vih\u0101ra\u1e41 hari\u1e25. \u201cLord Hari perfects His youth by arranging loving pastimes in the groves of the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana forest.\u201d"

        "purport": " Throughout the Tenth Canto, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura gives elaborate poetic commentaries on Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes. It is not always possible to include these extensive descriptions, but we will quote in its entirety his comments on this verse. It is our sincere recommendation to the learned Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava community that a qualified devotee of the Lord present the entire commentary of \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b on the Tenth Canto as a separate book, which will undoubtedly be appreciated by devotees and nondevotees alike. The \u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s comments on this verse are as follows: \u201cIn this context we will make our analysis according to the method described in \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s Ujjvala-n\u012blama\u1e47i. There are two categories of gop\u012bs: the eternally perfect (the nitya-siddhas) and those who have become perfect by practicing bhakti-yoga (the s\u0101dhana-siddhas). The s\u0101dhana-siddhas are of two categories: those who belong to special groups and those who do not. And there are also two classes of the gop\u012bs belonging to special groups: namely the \u015bruti-c\u0101r\u012bs, who come from the group of the personified Vedas, and the \u1e5b\u1e63i-c\u0101r\u012bs, who come from the group of sages who saw Lord R\u0101macandra in the Da\u1e47\u1e0dak\u0101ra\u1e47ya forest. \u201cThis same fourfold categorization of the gop\u012bs is given in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u2018It is understood that some of the gop\u012bs are personified Vedic literatures, while others are reborn sages, daughters of cowherds, or demigod maidens. But by no means, my dear King, are any of them ordinary humans.\u2019 Here we are informed that although the gop\u012bs appeared to be human cowherd girls, they actually were not. Thus the contention that they are mortals is refuted. \u201cThe daughters of cowherds, referred to here as gopa-kany\u0101s, must be eternally perfect, since we never hear of them having executed any s\u0101dhana. Their apparent s\u0101dhana of worshiping goddess K\u0101ty\u0101yan\u012b in the role of gop\u012bs merely manifests their manner of playing like human beings, and the Bh\u0101gavatam narrates the account of this worship only to show how they had fully taken on the role of cowherd girls. \u201cThat the gopa-kany\u0101 gop\u012bs are actually nitya-siddhas, eternally perfect devotees of the Lord, is established by a statement in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37) \u2014 \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibh\u0101vit\u0101bhi\u1e25 \u2014 which proves that they are the Lord\u2019s spiritual pleasure potency. Similarly, we have the words of the Gautam\u012bya-tantra, hl\u0101din\u012b y\u0101 mah\u0101-\u015bakti\u1e25. Further corroboration of their eternal perfection is that these gop\u012bs, being coeternal with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, their lover, are mentioned along with Him in the eighteen-syllable mantra, the ten-syllable mantra and others, and also that the worship of these mantras, and also the \u015brutis that present them, have been in existence since beginningless time.\u201d The deva-kany\u0101s, daughters of the demigods, who are mentioned in the verse beginning sambhavas tv amara-striya\u1e25, are explained in \u015ar\u012b Ujjvala-n\u012blama\u1e47i as partial expansions of the gop\u012bs who are eternally perfect. That the \u015bruti-c\u0101r\u012b gop\u012bs, the personified Vedas, are s\u0101dhana-siddha is understood from the following words of theirs quoted in the B\u1e5bhad-v\u0101mana Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u2018Since we have seen Your face, which possesses the beauty of millions of Cupids, our minds have become lusty after You like those of young girls, and we have forgotten all other allurements. We have developed the desire to act toward You as do the gop\u012bs who dwell on Your transcendental planet and who manifest the nature of Cupid by worshiping You with the idea that You are their paramour.\u2019 \u201cThe \u1e5b\u1e63i-c\u0101r\u012b gop\u012bs are also s\u0101dhana-siddha, as stated in Ujjvala-n\u012blama\u1e47i: gop\u0101lop\u0101sak\u0101\u1e25 p\u016brvam apr\u0101pt\u0101bh\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da-siddhaya\u1e25. Previously they were all mah\u0101r\u1e63is living in the Da\u1e47\u1e0daka forest. We find evidence for this in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Uttara-kha\u1e47\u1e0da: This verse says that upon seeing Lord R\u0101macandra, the sages in the Da\u1e47\u1e0daka forest desired to enjoy Lord Hari (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a). In other words, the sight of Lord R\u0101ma\u2019s beauty reminded them of Lord Hari, Gop\u0101la, their personal object of worship, and they then wanted to enjoy with Him. But out of embarrassment they did not act on that desire, whereupon Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101ma, who is like a desire tree, gave His mercy to them, even though they had not voiced their request. Thus their desire was fulfilled, as stated by the words beginning te sarve. By means of their lusty attraction they became freed from the ocean of material existence, the cycle of birth and death, and coincidentally they got the association of Hari in conjugal love. \u201cIn the present verse of the Bh\u0101gavatam we understand that it was the gop\u012bs who had children who were kept forcibly at home. This fact is clear from verses yet to come: m\u0101tara\u1e25 pitara\u1e25 putr\u0101\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.29.20), yat-paty-apatya-suh\u1e5bd\u0101m anuv\u1e5bttir a\u1e45ga (Bh\u0101g. 10.29.32) and pati-sut\u0101nvaya-bhr\u0101t\u1e5b-b\u0101ndhav\u0101n (Bh\u0101g. 10.31.16). In his comments on the Tenth Canto, \u015ar\u012bla Kavi-kar\u1e47ap\u016bra Gosv\u0101m\u012b mentions this fact. Without trying to repeat all his thoughts on this verse, we will give the gist of his purport: \u201c\u2018Upon seeing the personal form of Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101macandra, the sages who were worshipers of Lord Gop\u0101la immediately became elevated to the mature platform of spontaneous devotion, automatically reaching the stages of firm faith, attraction and attachment. But they had not yet completely freed themselves of all material contamination; therefore \u015ar\u012b Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101-devi arranged for them to take birth from the wombs of gop\u012bs and become cowherd girls. By associating with the eternally perfect gop\u012bs, some of these new gop\u012bs fully manifested p\u016brva-raga loving attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as soon as they reached puberty. (This kind of attraction develops even before one meets the beloved.) When these new gop\u012bs got the direct audience of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and physically associated with Him, all their remaining contamination became burned up, and they achieved the advanced stages of prema, sneha and so on. \u201c\u2018Even though they were in the company of their cowherd husbands, by the power of Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 the gop\u012bs remained unsullied by sexual contact with them; rather, they were situated in purely spiritual bodies that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enjoyed. On the night they heard the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute, their husbands tried to stop them, but by the merciful assistance of Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 the s\u0101dhana-siddha gop\u012bs were able to go forth to their beloved, together with the nitya-siddha gop\u012bs. \u201c\u2018Other gop\u012bs, however, because of not getting the good fortune of associating with the nitya-siddha gop\u012bs and other advanced gop\u012bs, had not achieved the stage of prema, and so their contamination was not completely burned away. They entered the company of their cowherd husbands and, after sexual union with them, gave birth to children. But a short time later even these gop\u012bs developed their p\u016brva-raga by hankering intensely for the physical association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 a hankering they acquired by associating with the advanced gop\u012bs. Becoming worthy recipients of the mercy of the perfected gop\u012bs, they assumed transcendental bodies fit to be enjoyed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 failed to help them overcome their husbands\u2019 attempts to keep them from going out, they felt themselves cast into the worst calamity. Viewing their husbands, brothers, fathers and other family members as enemies, they came close to dying. Just as other women might remember their mothers or other relatives at the time of death, these gop\u012bs remembered the sole friend of their very life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as stated in the present verse of the Bh\u0101gavatam, beginning with the word antar. \u201c\u2018It is implied that those ladies were not able to exit because they were held back by their husbands, who were standing before them with sticks in their hands, scolding them. Although these gop\u012bs were perpetually absorbed in love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, at that particular time they meditated upon Him and cried out within: \u201cAlas, alas, O only friend of our life! O ocean of the artistic skills of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana forest! Please let us become your girlfriends in some future life, because at this time we cannot see Your lotuslike face with our eyes. So be it; we shall look upon You with our minds.\u201d Each of them lamenting to herself in this way, the gop\u012bs stood with their eyes shut and meditated deeply upon Him.\u2019\u201d"

By meditating upon Him they realized His embrace, and the ecstasy they then felt exhausted their material piety. Although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Soul, these girls simply thought of Him as their male lover and associated with Him in that intimate mood. Thus their karmic bondage was nullified and they abandoned their gross material bodies.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b comments upon this verse as follows: \u201cHere \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b speaks in a peculiar way: he presents the intimate object the gop\u012bs attained as if it were an external idea, thus keeping its true nature secret from outsiders, while at the same time he reveals to the confidential devotees well versed in the scientific conclusions of devotional service the internal meaning that is his real purport. Thus to outsiders \u015aukadeva says that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave the gop\u012bs liberation, but to the confidential hearers \u015aukadeva reveals that when the gop\u012bs experienced separation from their beloved there arose in them both immeasurable unhappiness and immeasurable happiness, and that they gradually achieved their desired goal. \u201cThus the verse can be understood as follows: Because of their intolerable separation from their beloved, the gop\u012bs felt terrible agony, by which they caused all inauspicious things to tremble. In other words, when people in general hear of the gop\u012bs\u2019 extreme agony in separation from their beloved, they abandon thousands of inauspicious things \u2014 things even as fearsome as the subterranean fires of millions of universes or the powerful poison swallowed by Lord \u015aiva. More specifically, those who hear of the gop\u012bs\u2019 love in separation give up their terrible false ego and, thinking themselves defeated, are shaken. When the gop\u012bs meditated on Lord Acyuta, He became manifest and personally came to them, and they experienced great joy by embracing His body, which was full of transcendental love for them. The gop\u012bs also experienced great joy by exhibiting personal characteristics and a sense of identification appropriate to such love. That joy made all their good fortune, both material and spiritual, seem paltry by comparison. \u201cThe implication is that when other persons see how happy the gop\u012bs became upon embracing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when He manifested Himself directly before them, these other persons feel that thousands of so-called auspicious objects are insignificant by comparison, including all the sense gratificatory pleasures found in millions of universes and even the supersensory pleasure of spiritual bliss (brahm\u0101nanda). Thus hearing of the gop\u012bs\u2019 distress and the joy that arose, respectively, out of their separation from the Supreme Lord and their union with Him, anyone can get rid of all the reactions of his past activities, both sinful and pious. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas certainly do not think that sinful and pious reactions can be destroyed only by being lived out, since, after all, neither separation from the Supreme Lord nor direct association with Him are in the category of karma. This kind of elimination of karmic reactions occurs in the stage of bhajana, for those who have come to the level of anartha-niv\u1e5btti. \u201cAnd thus the gop\u012bs thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or supreme worthy object of all love \u2014 as their paramour. Even though such a concept is ordinarily contemptible, the gop\u012bs realized K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in an even fuller sense than did Rukmi\u1e47\u012b and His other queens, who thought of Him most respectfully as their husband. That thinking of the Lord as one\u2019s paramour is superior to thinking of Him as one\u2019s husband is proved by the fact that unbridled pure love is superior to domesticated love. This idea is borne out by the following words of \u015ar\u012b Uddhava: y\u0101 dustyaja\u1e41 sva-janam \u0101rya-patha\u1e41 ca hitv\u0101.\u00a0\u2018These ladies of Vraja abandoned their families and their advanced religious principles, even though to do so is very difficult.\u2019 (Bh\u0101g. 10.47.61) \u201cIn His pastimes on earth K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a often turns the most lowly things into the most elevated. As Bh\u012b\u1e63ma stated, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastime of acting as Arjuna\u2019s chariot driver was even more elevated than the pastimes in which He acted as a mighty King of kings: vijaya-ratha-ku\u1e6dumba \u0101tta-totre/ dh\u1e5bta-haya-ra\u015bmini tac-chriyesk\u1e63a\u1e47\u012bye.\u00a0\u2018I concentrate upon the chariot driver of Arjuna, who stood with a whip in His right hand and a bridle rope in His left, and who was very careful to protect Arjuna\u2019s chariot by all means.\u2019 (Bh\u0101g. 1.9.39) Similarly, in the Lord\u2019s appearance as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a we see that the normally inferior conjugal rasa becomes better than the normally superior mood of \u015b\u0101nta-rasa, as also the attitude of loving a paramour becomes superior to the loving exchange between legitimate spouses, and lowly gu\u00f1j\u0101 necklaces, red oxide paste and peacock feathers become better than the most excellent jeweled ornaments. \u201cBut, it may be objected, it is not fitting for the Supreme Lord to sport with women whose bodies have already been enjoyed by other men. This objection is replied to by the words beginning jahu\u1e25. The word deham is used here in the singular form to indicate unity of category, even though the gop\u012bs are many. Some authorities say that by the power of Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 these gop\u012bs\u2019 bodies disappeared in a way no one noticed, but other authorities say that the\u00a0\u2018body\u2019 referred to in this context is the inferior body, composed of the modes of material nature. Thus by the prominence of the adjective gu\u1e47a-mayam, it is understood that before the gop\u012bs heard the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute their bodies had been twofold, material and spiritual, and upon hearing the flute they gave up the material bodies, which their husbands had enjoyed. We may analyze this as follows: \u201cWhen devotees begin prosecuting devotional service in accordance with the instructions of a bona fide spiritual master, they engage their ears and other senses in pure devotion by hearing of the Lord, chanting His glories, remembering Him, offering obeisances to Him, giving Him personal attendance, and so forth. Thus the devotees make the Lord\u2019s transcendental qualities the objects of their senses, as stated by the Lord Himself: nirgu\u1e47o mad-ap\u0101\u015braya\u1e25. (Bh\u0101g. 11.25.26) In this way the devotees\u2019 bodies transcend the material modes. Yet sometimes the devotees may take as their sense objects mundane sounds and so on, and that is material. Thus a devotee\u2019s body can have two aspects, transcendental and material. \u201cAccording to one\u2019s level of devotional service, to that degree the transcendental aspects of one\u2019s body become prominent and the material aspects diminish. This transformation is described in the following verse from the Bh\u0101gavatam (11.2.42): \u2018Devotion, direct experience of the Supreme Lord, and detachment from other things \u2014 these three occur simultaneously for one who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the same way that pleasure, nourishment and relief from hunger come simultaneously and increasingly, with each bite, for a person engaged in eating.\u2019 When one achieves totally pure love of God, the material portions of the body disappear and the body becomes completely spiritual. Nonetheless, so as not to disturb the false opinions of atheists and so as to protect the confidentiality of devotional service, the Supreme Lord usually has His illusory energy exhibit the demise of the gross body. An example of this is the disappearance of the Y\u0101davas during the Mau\u1e63ala-l\u012bl\u0101. \u201cSometimes, however, to proclaim the excellence of bhakti-yoga, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will allow a devotee to go back to Godhead in his selfsame body, as in the case of Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. We can cite evidence for this point from the Twenty-fifth Chapter of the Eleventh Canto, text 32: \u2018A living entity who conquers the modes of material nature, which are manifested from the mind, can dedicate himself to Me [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a] by the process of devotional service and thus attain pure love for Me.\u2019 Here the Lord states that the defeat and destruction of that which is composed of the modes of material nature can be brought about only by the process of devotional service. \u201cTherefore, what we should understand from the present verse of the Bh\u0101gavatam is that the gop\u012bs who could not go to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had their inauspicious, material bodies removed or burned up, while their auspicious, spiritual bodies, far from being destroyed, simply grew more prominent because of the ecstasy the gop\u012bs felt by embracing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in meditation. Thus their bondage was completely destroyed: by the help of Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 they got free from ignorance and also from the prohibitions of their husbands and other relatives. \u201cWe should not make the mistake of explaining this falling away of the gop\u012bs\u2019 bodies as being a result of their dying. As the Lord Himself states (Bh\u0101g. 10.47.37): \u2018Some of those all-auspcious gop\u012bs could not directly join Me in enjoying the r\u0101sa dance on that night in this V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana forest, yet still they achieved My association by remembering My transcendental pastimes.\u2019 By using the word kaly\u0101\u1e47ya\u1e25 in this verse, the Lord implies,\u00a0\u2018Even though these gop\u012bs wanted to give up their bodies because of their husbands\u2019 prohibitions and the torment of separation from Me, for them to die at the very beginning of the most auspicious festival of the r\u0101sa dance would have been displeasing to Me and thus inauspicious. So they did not die.\u2019 \u201cMore evidence that the gop\u012bs who were prevented from going to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not physically die is provided by a statement of \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva\u2019s later in this canto (10.47.38): t\u0101 \u016bcur uddhava\u1e41 pr\u012bt\u0101s tat-sande\u015b\u0101gata-sm\u1e5bt\u012b\u1e25.\u00a0\u2018Then they [the gop\u012bs] replied to Uddhava, feeling satisfied because His message had reminded them of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u2019 Here we understand that the gop\u012bs speaking to Uddhava were the ones who had not had the chance to participate directly in the r\u0101sa dance because of being held captive in their homes. Thus the conclusion is that they gave up their material bodies without dying. Parched by the intense heat of separation, their material bodies gave up their materiality and became purely spiritual, just like the bodies of such great devotees as Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. This is the meaning of the gop\u012bs\u2019\u00a0\u2018giving up their bodies.\u2019 \u201cThe following analogy illustrates the statuses of the various gop\u012bs: By observing seven or eight ripe mangoes on a tree, we can ascertain that all the fruits on the tree are ripe. Then we can pick them all and bring them home, where in due course the sun\u2019s rays and other agents will make them fine-looking, fragrant and delicious \u2014 fit to be offered to the king for his enjoyment. When the time comes for the king to take his meal, a discriminating servant can choose those fruits ready to offer him. From the appearance of the fruits the servant can tell which are ripe in the middle but still raw on the outside and thus not yet fit for the king. By the application of a special heating process, these remaining fruits will become ripe in two or three days, and then they too will be ready to offer to the king. \u201cSimilarly, among the muni-c\u0101r\u012b gop\u012bs who took birth in Gokula, those who completely gave up the materiality of their bodies and very early in life achieved purely spiritual bodies were able to remain untouched by any other man; thus Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 allowed them to join the nitya-siddha and other advanced gop\u012bs when they went to meet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Other muni-c\u0101r\u012b gop\u012bs still retained some connection with the external material body, but even they, after being parched by the heat of separation from \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, gave up the materiality of their bodies and assumed perfectly transcendental bodies, purified of all taint of contact with other men. On the night of the r\u0101sa dance, Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 sent some of these gop\u012bs out behind those who had already gone out; others, who Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 saw still had a slight amount of contamination, she kept back to further purify with the heat of separation, and then she sent them out on some other night. \u201cAfter enjoying the pleasures of the r\u0101sa dance and other pastimes with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the muni-c\u0101r\u012b gop\u012bs who had participated went back to their homes when the night was over, as did the nitya-siddha and other advanced gop\u012bs. But now Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 protected these muni-c\u0101r\u012b gop\u012bs from the material association of their husbands; in other words, these gop\u012bs were devoid of any selfish attachment for husband, children and so on. Since these gop\u012bs were thoroughly immersed in the great ocean of love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, their breasts dried up so that they could not feed their infants, and to their family members they appeared as if haunted by ghosts. In conclusion, it is not unseemly that the gop\u012bs who were previously in material association joined in the r\u0101sa dance. \u201cSome authorities, however, maintain that the gop\u012bs who were kept back in their houses did not have children. According to them, whenever such words as apatya (\u2018children\u2019) are used in verses yet to come, these words refer to the children of co-wives, to adopted children or to nephews and nieces.\u201d"

        "purport": " Although the spiritual nature of conditioned souls may be covered by illusion, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s spiritual nature is omnipotent and is never covered by any other power. In fact, all other powers are His energy and thus function according to His will. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.44) states, s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di sthiti-pralaya-s\u0101dhana-\u015baktir ek\u0101/ ch\u0101yeva yasya bhuvan\u0101ni bibharti durg\u0101/ icch\u0101nur\u016bpam api yasya ca ce\u1e63\u1e6date s\u0101: \u201cThe mighty Durg\u0101, who creates, maintains and annihilates the material worlds, is the potency of the Supreme Lord, and she moves like His shadow, according to His desire.\u201d Thus because the Lord\u2019s spiritual influence does not depend on whether someone understands Him or not, the gop\u012bs\u2019 spontaneous love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a guaranteed their spiritual perfection. The great Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya quotes the following relevant passages from the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cAt that time the gop\u012bs, who desired K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, gave up their bodies and went to the spiritual world. Because they properly understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme Absolute Truth, they transcended the influence of time.\u201d \u201cIn their previous lives most of the gop\u012bs were already fully endowed with transcendental knowledge. It is because of this knowledge, not their lust, that they were able to attain the Supreme Brahman.\u201d \u201cThe Vedas declare that without spiritual knowledge there is no valid path to liberation. Because these apparently lusty gop\u012bs possessed devotion and knowledge, they achieved liberation.\u201d \u201cThus even in their attainment of liberation,\u00a0\u2018lust\u2019 followed as a manifestation of their pure devotion. After all, what we call liberation was experienced even by envious persons like \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la.\u201d \u201cBy the mercy of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, one who follows the path of devotional service gains liberation as a by-product, and such a person\u2019s lusty desire, which would normally invoke misfortune, instead invokes the mercy of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u when exhibited in pure devotion.\u201d \u201cLord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u will save even a devotee possessed of an envious life. Just see the extreme mercy of the Lord, as shown by His granting liberation to \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la!\u201d \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la was Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s cousin. He was mortified when the Lord stole the gorgeous young Rukmi\u1e47\u012b, whom \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la himself was hell-bent on marrying. For various other reasons also, \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la was consumed with envy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and finally he insanely offended Him in a great assembly called the R\u0101jas\u016bya sacrifice. At that time K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a nonchalantly cut off \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la\u2019s head and gave him liberation. Everyone present saw the effulgent soul of \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la rise out of his dead body and merge into the existence of the Lord. The Seventh Canto explains that \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la was an incarnation of a gatekeeper in the spiritual world cursed to take birth on the earth as a demon. Since even \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la was liberated by the Lord, who took into consideration the whole situation, then what to speak of the gop\u012bs, who loved K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a more than anything."

        "translation": "Persons who constantly direct their lust, anger, fear, protective affection, feeling of impersonal oneness or friendship toward Lord Hari are sure to become absorbed in thought of Him.",
        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is pure spiritual existence, and those who somehow or other become attached to Him, absorbed in thoughts of Him, rise to the spiritual platform. This is the absolute nature of the Lord\u2019s personal association. With this verse \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b answers King Par\u012bk\u1e63it\u2019s question about the gop\u012bs. After all, \u015aukadeva has begun to narrate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s most intimate pastime, the r\u0101sa dance, and Par\u012bk\u1e63it is cooperating to remove the doubts of others who are hearing or who in the future may hear this astonishing story. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted a statement from the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a that emphatically declares persons like the gop\u012bs to be liberated souls, beyond the pale of material illusion: \u201cEternal conjugal attraction to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, expressed in pure devotional service, cannot develop in one who is not already liberated. Thus those who are devoted to Lord Hari, even in conjugal attraction, are already liberated. \u201c\u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya then quotes from the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a to clarify the essential point that one cannot be liberated simply by lusting after Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but rather only by possessing conjugal attraction in pure devotional service: \u201cThe demigods are always affectionately devoted to the Lord, and the young ladies of heaven called Apsar\u0101s have lusty feelings toward Him, although some of them have pure devotion for Him untainted by material lust. Only these latter Apsar\u0101s are ready for liberation, because without bona fide devotional service one cannot possibly achieve liberation.\u201d Thus devotional service is not yogyam, or appropriate, unless free from material lust. One should not take cheaply the gop\u012bs\u2019 achievement of personal association with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a conjugal relationship. To show the gravity of direct relationship with the Lord, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has quoted the following verses from the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cThe goddess Lak\u1e63m\u012b worships Lord Jan\u0101rdana as her husband, Lord Brahm\u0101 worships Him as his father, and the other demigods worship Him as their grandfather.\u201d \u201cThus people in general should think,\u00a0\u2018The Supreme Lord is my great-grandfather.\u2019 Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the spiritual master of Brahm\u0101 and thus the guru of the guru of the demigods.\u201d \u201cBrahm\u0101 is the spiritual master of this universe, and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the eternally worshipable Deity. With this understanding, and not otherwise, one should worship the Lord.\u201d The above injunctions apply to sarva-jana, \u201call people in general.\u201d Thus one should follow these injunctions until one achieves the exalted platform of intimate relationship with the Supreme Lord. There is abundant evidence that the gop\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana were highly elevated, liberated souls, and thus their pastimes with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are pure, spiritual affairs. Keeping this in mind, we can truly understand this chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has written the following charming commentary on this verse: \u201c[The gop\u012bs thought,]\u00a0\u2018Alas, alas, even after shattering our family responsibilities, our sobriety and our shame and enjoying us day after day, and after now dragging us here by the sound of His flute, He is asking us why we have come!\u2019 \u201cAs the gop\u012bs cast sidelong glances at one another, the Lord said,\u00a0\u2018If you try to tell Me that you have come to get night-blooming flowers to use in the worship of God, and that it is these flowers you are looking at with your sidelong glances, I will have to reject your excuse as unacceptable, since neither the time, place nor persons involved are appropriate.\u2019 \u201cThis is the Lord\u2019s meaning in the verse beginning rajan\u012b. He might have said, \u2018Even though there is abundant moonlight, this time of night is very fearsome because many snakes, scorpions and other dangerous creatures too small for you to see are lying beneath the creepers, roots and twigs. Therefore this time is unsuitable for gathering flowers. And not only the time but also this place is unsuitable for you to gather flowers, because at night terrible creatures such as tigers are abroad here. Therefore you should go back to Vraja.\u2019 \u201c\u2018But,\u2019 the gop\u012bs may object, \u2018let us just rest for a few minutes, and then we will go.\u2019 \u201cThen the Lord might reply, \u2018Women shouldn\u2019t remain in this kind of place.\u2019 In other words, \u2018Because of the time and place, it is wrong for persons like yourselves to stay here even for a moment.\u2019 \u201cFurthermore, by the word su-madhyam\u0101\u1e25, \u2018O slender-waisted ones,\u2019 the Lord implied, \u2018You are beautiful young girls, and I am a beautiful young boy. Because you are all very chaste and I am a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, as confirmed by the words k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47o brahmac\u0101r\u012b in the \u015bruti [Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad], there should be no fault in our being in the same place. Nonetheless, the mind can never be trusted \u2014 neither yours nor My own.\u2019 \u201cThe Lord\u2019s inner eagerness thus hinted at is obvious if we read His words between the lines, as follows: \u2018If out of shyness you cannot tell Me the reason you\u2019ve come, then don\u2019t speak. I already know it anyway, so just listen as I tell it to you.\u2019 Thus the Lord speaks the words beginning rajan\u012b.\u201d The following statement by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is based on an alternative meaning of the verse derived when the Sanskrit words are separated in a different way. The alternative separation, according to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, would be rajan\u012b e\u1e63\u0101 aghora-r\u016bp\u0101 aghora-sattva-ni\u1e63evit\u0101/ pratiy\u0101ta vraja\u1e41 na iha stheya\u1e41 stribhi\u1e25 su-madhyam\u0101\u1e25. Through \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha\u2019s commentary K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a now explains the meaning of this division of words. \u201c\u2018The pervasive moonshine has made this night appear not at all fearsome, and therefore this forest is populated by harmless creatures such as deer (aghora-sattvai\u1e25), or else by animals such as tigers that are harmless because of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana\u2019s naturally nonviolent atmosphere. Consequently this night should not frighten you.\u2019 Or else K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may have meant, \u2018You should not be afraid of your own husbands and other relatives because, the night being populated by fearsome animals, they will not come near this place. Therefore please do not go back to Vraja [na pratiy\u0101ta], but stay here in My company [iha stheyam].\u2019 \u201cThe gop\u012bs may ask the Lord, \u2018How are You staying here?\u2019 \u201cThe Lord answers, \u2018With women.\u2019 \u201cBut are You satisfied to keep just any women in Your company?\u2019 \u201cThe Lord replies to this with the word su-madhyam\u0101\u1e25, meaning, \u2018Only women who are young and beautiful, who have slender waists \u2014 namely yourselves \u2014 should stay here with Me, and not others.\u2019 Thus we can appreciate that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statements are full of considerate as well as neglectful sentiments.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s words are certainly brilliant, because according to the rules of Sanskrit grammar they may be understood in either of two opposite ways. In the first case, as translated above, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a continues to tease the gop\u012bs by telling them the night is dangerous and inauspicious and that they should go home. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is simultaneously saying exactly the opposite \u2014 namely, that there is absolutely no reason for the gop\u012bs to fear coming to the Lord, that the night is quite auspicious and that the girls should under no circumstances go back home. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a simultaneously teases and enchants the gop\u012bs with His words."

All this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says to the gop\u012bs who are married. And now to the unmarried girls He says, \u2018The calves are crying, so see to it that they get milk.\u2019 To the muni-c\u0101r\u012b gop\u012bs He says, \u2018Your babies are crying, so feed them milk.\u2019\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura further reveals the hidden meaning of these two verses as follows: \u201cIn text 21 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a might have said, \u2018This V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is the very best of places, and moreover this is a full-moon night. Furthermore, we have the Yamun\u0101 on all sides, and there are cool, gentle, fragrant breezes blowing. These are all transcendental opulences that stimulate loving exchanges, and since I am also here as the foremost ecstatic opulence \u2014 the object of love \u2014 let us now test how much expertise you can show in relishing rasas.\u2019 \u201cIn text 22 He means to say, \u2018Thus for a long time, for the entire duration of this night, don\u2019t leave, but rather stay here and enjoy with Me. Don\u2019t go serve your husbands and the gentle women \u2014 your mothers-in-law and so forth. It would not be fitting for you to waste such beauty and youth, which are gifts of the creator. Nor should you milk the cows or give milk to the calves and babies. What do you, who are so full of ecstatic attraction for Me, have to do with these affairs?\u2019\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also explains that the gop\u012bs could not really be sure exactly what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was doing \u2014 whether He was merely joking, inviting them to stay or instructing them to return home. Thus as \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke about the beauty of the forest, the gop\u012bs felt embarrassed and bewildered and looked upward at the trees, and as He spoke about the Yamun\u0101 they looked all around at the river. Their absolute purity and simplicity, along with their absolute devotion to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the conjugal mood, created the most beautiful pastimes ever exhibited in this universe."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Soul of all souls, their dearmost friend and well-wisher. As stated in the Eleventh Canto of the Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.41): \u201cO King, one who has given up all material duties and has taken full shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, who offers shelter to all, is not indebted to the demigods, great sages, ordinary living beings, relatives, friends, mankind or even one\u2019s forefathers who have passed away. Since all such classes of living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, one who has surrendered to the Lord\u2019s service has no need to serve such persons separately.\u201d Authority descends from the author of all existence, the Supreme Lord. Natural figures of authority such as husbands, mothers, government leaders and sages gain their power and authority from the Supreme Lord and should thus represent the Absolute Truth to those who follow them. If one wholeheartedly engages in loving service to the original, Supreme Truth, one need not indirectly serve the Absolute Truth through the above-mentioned secondary authorities. Even a soul surrendered to God, however, continues to serve the spiritual master, who is a direct, not an indirect, representative of the Supreme Lord. A bona fide \u0101c\u0101rya, or spiritual master, is the transparent medium leading the disciple to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All indirect authorities become obsolete when one is directly in touch with the Absolute Truth. The gop\u012bs wanted to explain this basic point to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and some of the bolder young girls among them attempted to defeat \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with His own statements, as exemplified in this verse."
