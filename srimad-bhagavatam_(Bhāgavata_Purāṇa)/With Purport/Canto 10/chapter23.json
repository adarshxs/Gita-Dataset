The philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not a primitive polytheistic doctrine holding that human beings on the earth are gods.

The authority and power of God naturally extend along with the extension of His creation, and on the earth the Lord\u2019s will and authority are represented by purified, enlightened men called br\u0101hma\u1e47as. This account will illustrate that the ritualistic br\u0101hma\u1e47as approached by the cowherd boys were not at all properly enlightened and thus could not appreciate the position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma or that of Their intimate associates.

We are ready to give up all material relationships.",
        "purport": " Here the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 wives are saying something similar to what the gop\u012bs say at the beginning of the r\u0101sa dance (Bh\u0101g. 10.29.31), when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells them to go home as well. Like this verse, the gop\u012bs\u2019 statement begins with the words maiva\u1e41 vibho\u00a0\u2019rhati bhav\u0101n gaditu\u1e41 n\u1e5b-\u015ba\u1e41sam. Nigama refers to the Vedic literature, which states that one who surrenders at the lotus feet of the Lord does not return to this material world. Thus the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 wives appealed to the Lord that since they had surrendered to Him, it was unfair for Him to order them to return to their materialistic husbands. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a might have pointed out to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 wives, \u201cYou young ladies are members of the aristocratic br\u0101hma\u1e47a community, so how can you surrender at the feet of a mere cowherd boy?\u201d To this the ladies might have replied, \u201cSince we have already surrendered at Your lotus feet, and since we desire to become Your servants, we are obviously not maintaining a false identification as members of the so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47a community. You can easily ascertain this from our words.\u201d Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a might have replied, \u201cI am a cowherd boy, and My proper maidservants and girlfriends are the cowherd girls, the gop\u012bs.\u201d The wives might have answered, \u201cTrue, let them be so. Let them shine forth if You are embarrassed in front of Your relatives to make br\u0101hma\u1e47a ladies Your maidservants. We certainly don\u2019t want to embarrass You. We will not go to Your village but will rather remain in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, like presiding deities of the forest. We simply desire to perfect our lives by even a slight trace of connection with You.\u201d Thus by the spiritual insight of \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, we learn that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as\u2019 wives offered to remain at a distance and simply take the tulas\u012b leaves that would fall from the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or be crushed by the feet of His girlfriends when He would embrace them. The ladies offered to carry these tulas\u012b leaves upon their heads. Thus renouncing the desire to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s intimate girlfriends or maidservants (a position they knew was difficult to achieve), the young br\u0101hma\u1e47a ladies begged to remain in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana forest. If the Lord had then asked \u201cThen what will your family members say?\u201d they would have replied \u201cWe have already transcended our so-called relatives because we are seeing You, the Supreme Lord, face to face.\u201d"

Consequently they always felt ecstatic love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and were indifferent to their household duties. Their husbands, seeing them as deviant, doubted them and avoided dealing with them as far as possible. Now the wives of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were ready to formally reject their so-called families and neighbors, and out of great agitation they were crying and placing their heads upon Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet, offering obeisances. In this way, with choking voices, they spoke the above verse. They begged that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a bestow upon them the benediction that He be their only destination, that He, the chastiser of enemies, subdue all their enemies \u2014 those difficulties obstructing them from attaining the Lord.\u201d The wives of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as simply wanted to serve Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this is pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in ecstatic love of Godhead."
