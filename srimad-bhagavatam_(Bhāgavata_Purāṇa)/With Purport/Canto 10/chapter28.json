The servant of Varu\u1e47a who arrested Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is stated here to be an asura, or demon, for obvious reasons. First, the servant was foolishly ignorant of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s position as the pastime father of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Also, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s intention was to carry out the injunctions of scripture; therefore Varu\u1e47a\u2019s servant should not have arrested Nanda on the technical grounds that he bathed in the Yamun\u0101 at an inauspicious time. Later in this chapter Varu\u1e47a himself will say, aj\u0101nat\u0101 m\u0101makena m\u016b\u1e0dhena: \u201cThis was done by my ignorant servant, who is a fool.\u201d This foolish servant did not understand the position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja or devotional service to the Lord. In conclusion, it is clear that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to give His personal audience to Varu\u1e47a and simultaneously accomplish other didactic purposes. Thus this wonderful pastime will now unfold."

Technically, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was correct in entering the water just before sunrise. The following explanation is given by \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his commentary on the first verse of this chapter: After an especially short Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b, measuring only eighteen hours, about six hours of the lunar day in which the fast had to be broken, namely the Dv\u0101da\u015b\u012b, had already expired before the dawn. Since at sunrise the proper time for breaking the fast would have passed, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja decided to enter the water at an otherwise inauspicious time. Of course, Varu\u1e47a\u2019s servant should have been aware of these technical details, which are meant for strict followers of the Vedic rituals. Above and beyond that, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was acting as the Supreme Lord\u2019s father and was therefore a most sacred person, beyond the touch of insignificant cosmic bureaucrats like the foolish servant of Varu\u1e47a."

        "translation": "[Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a thought:] Certainly people in this world are wandering among higher and lower destinations, which they achieve through activities performed according to their desires and without full knowledge. Thus people do not know their real destination.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has elaborately explained how this verse applies to the eternally liberated residents of \u015ar\u012b V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the Lord\u2019s abode. One of the fundamental philosophical principles of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the distinction between two types of illusion, Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 and Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, the spiritual and material states of existence, respectively. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is God, the omnipotent, omniscient Supreme Being, His intimate associates in the spiritual world love Him so much that they see Him as their beloved child, friend, lover and so on. So that their ecstatic love can transcend the boundaries of mere reverence, they forget that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme God of all the universes, and thus their pure, intimate love expands unlimitedly. One may consider their activities of treating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a helpless child, a handsome boyfriend, or a playmate to be a manifestation of avidy\u0101, ignorance of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s position as God, but the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are in fact ignoring the secondary majesty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and focusing intensely on His infinite beauty, which is the essence of His existence. In fact, describing Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme controller and God is almost a type of political analysis, referring as it does to a hierarchy of power and control. Such analysis of levels of power and hierarchies of rule is significant in a context in which one entity is not fully surrendered, in love, to a higher entity. In other words, control becomes visible, or is consciously felt as control, when there is resistance to that control. To cite a simple example: A pious, law-abiding citizen sees a policeman as a friend and well-wisher, whereas a criminal sees him as a threatening symbol of punishment. Those who are enthusiastic about government policies feel not that the government is controlling them but rather that it is helping them. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is seen as a \u201ccontroller,\u201d and hence as \u201cthe Supreme God,\u201d by those who are not fully enchanted by His beauty and pastimes. Those fully in love with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a focus on His sublime, attractive features and, because of the nature of their relationship with Him, do not much notice His controlling power. A simple proof that the residents of Vraja have transcended lower states of God consciousness rather than failed to attain them is the fact that throughout the pastimes of the Lord they often \u201cremember\u201d that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is God. Usually they are astonished at this remembrance, having been fully absorbed in seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as their friend, lover and so on. The word k\u0101ma is conventionally used to indicate a material desire, or else a spiritual desire so intense that it becomes somehow analogous to intense material desires. Still, the fundamental distinction remains: material desire is selfish and self-gratificatory; spiritual desire is free of selfishness, being wholly for the pleasure of the other, the Lord. Thus the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana executed their daily activities solely for the pleasure of their beloved K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It should be remembered that the entire purpose of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s descent into this world is to attract living beings back home, back to Godhead. Two things are required for this: that His pastimes display the beauty of spiritual perfection, and that they somehow seem relevant and hence interesting to the conditioned souls of this world. The Bh\u0101gavatam often states that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a plays just like a youthful actor, and He undoubtedly engages His eternal devotees in the dramatic presentation. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here muses to Himself that people in this world certainly do not know their ultimate destination, and with an obvious touch of the facetious He also thinks in this way about His own eternally liberated associates, who were playing in this world like ordinary members of a cowherd village. Apart from the double meaning obviously present in this verse when it is applied to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s liberated associates, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here makes an entirely direct and pointedly critical observation about ordinary people. When applied to conditioned souls who are actually wandering throughout the universe, His statement that people are acting out of ignorance and lust is not mitigated by any deeper, spiritual meaning. People in general are simply ignorant, and they do not seriously consider their ultimate destination. As usual, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is able to say many profound and complex things in a few simple words. How fortunate we are that God is not a dry field of energy, a transcendent, effulgent blob, or nothing at all \u2014 as various people would have it. In fact, He is the most wonderful Personality of Godhead, full of absolute personal qualities, and certainly whatever we can do, He can do better, as evidenced by His brilliant way of speaking."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a submerged the cowherd men in that lake in the sense that He submerged them in the awareness of the impersonal Brahman. But then, as indicated by the word uddh\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25, He lifted them up to a higher understanding, that of the Personality of Godhead in His own planet. As clearly stated here, dad\u1e5b\u015bur brahma\u1e47o lokam: They saw, just as Akr\u016bra did, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Truth. The evolution of consciousness may be briefly summarized as follows: In ordinary consciousness we perceive and are attracted to the variety of material things. Rising to the first stage of spiritual consciousness, we transcend material variety and focus instead on the undifferentiated One, which lies behind and gives existence to the many. Finally, rising to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, we find that the absolute, spiritual One contains its own eternal variety. In fact, since this world is a mere shadow of eternal existence, we would expect to find spiritual variety within the One, and indeed we do find it in the sacred text of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam.

As \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura points out, these verses emphasize that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not merely show the cowherd men a sample Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet but that He specifically revealed His K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, the greatest of eternal abodes and the natural home of the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, who loved K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a more than anyone else did."
