They are all Your servants and You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons with a poor fund of knowledge consider Your Lordship an ordinary human being. Sometimes they try to find fault in You, and sometimes they defame You. Therefore I wish to perform the R\u0101jas\u016bya-yaj\u00f1a. I wish to invite all the demigods, beginning from Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and other exalted chiefs of the heavenly planets, and in that great assembly of the demigods from all parts of the universe, I want to substantiate that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that everyone is Your servant.\u201d"

I wish to show the world that one can attain the highest perfection of life simply by taking shelter at Your lotus feet, exactly as one can satisfy the branches, twigs, leaves and flowers of an entire tree simply by watering the root.

But in this world there are some whose hearts are contaminated and who thus think You are not the Supreme Personality of Godhead but an ordinary man. Or else they find fault with You and even criticize You. This is an arrow piercing our hearts. \u201cTherefore, to extract this arrow from our heart, we must call to this place \u2014 on the pretext of the R\u0101jas\u016bya \u2014 Brahm\u0101, Rudra and other wise brahmac\u0101r\u012bs and demigods who reside in each of the fourteen planetary systems. When such an exalted congregation has assembled, it will be incumbent upon them to first arrange for the agra-p\u016bj\u0101, or the first worship for the most worthy person present. And when they are directly shown that You, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the arrow piercing our heart will be removed.\u201d"

As confirmed by great authorities, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is a pure devotee of the Lord, and thus his actual motivation in discharging his duties as a king was to establish the supremacy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the real purport of the activities of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, which are described in both the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata."

Just like the heavenly desire tree, You bless all who properly worship You, granting their desired fruits in proportion to the service they render You. There is nothing wrong in this.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b explains that a desire tree has no material attachments or partiality but simply bestows its fruits upon those who deserve them, and not upon others. J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b Prabhup\u0101da adds that a desire tree does not think, \u201cThis person is fit to worship me, but that other person is not.\u201d Rather, a desire tree is satisfied with all who properly serve it. And the Lord acts in the same way, as explained here by King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b adds that no one should accuse Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a of being envious of one person and showing favoritism toward another. Since the Lord is sva-sukh\u0101nubh\u016bti, experiencing His own happiness within Himself, He has nothing to gain or lose in relation to conditioned souls. Rather, He reciprocates according to how they approach Him. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da very nicely sums up this point as follows in his rendering of King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s statement: \u201cIf one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his life becomes fulfilled both materially and spiritually. This does not mean that You are partial to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person and indifferent to the non-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. You are equal to everyone; that is Your declaration. You cannot be partial to one and not interested in others, because You are sitting in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul and giving everyone the respective results of his fruitive activities. You give every living entity the chance to enjoy this material world as he desires. As the Supersoul, You are sitting in the body along with the living entity, giving him the results of his own actions as well as opportunities to turn toward Your devotional service by developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. You openly declare that one should surrender unto You, giving up all other engagements, and that You will take charge of him, giving him relief from the reactions of all sins. You are like the desire tree in the heavenly planets, which awards benediction according to one\u2019s desires. Everyone is free to achieve the highest perfection, but if one does not so desire, then Your awarding of lesser benedictions is not due to partiality.\u201d"

The kings were thus informed that they were required to pay taxes for the execution of the sacrifice.

Because Jar\u0101sandha was a materialist, they appealed to his natural interest in the heavenly planets, where life lasts so long that it appears permanent to people on earth. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b briefly summarizes the history of the personalities mentioned in this verse: \u201cTo pay off his debts to Vi\u015bv\u0101m\u012btra, Hari\u015bcandra sold everything he had, including his wife and children. Yet even after attaining the status of a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la, he did not become discouraged; thus he went to heaven, together with all the inhabitants of Ayodhy\u0101. Rantideva, after going without even water for forty-eight days, somehow obtained some food and water, but then some beggars came and he gave it all away to them. In this way he attained Brahmaloka. Mudgala followed the practice of gathering grains left behind in the fields after the harvest. Yet still he was hospitable toward uninvited guests, even after his family had been suffering in poverty for six months. Thus he also went to Brahmaloka. \u201cTo protect a pigeon who had taken shelter of him, King \u015aibi gave his own flesh to a hawk and attained heaven. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja gave all his property to Lord Hari when the Lord disguised Himself as a dwarf br\u0101hma\u1e47a (V\u0101manadeva), and so Bali gained the Lord\u2019s personal association. The pigeon and his mate gave their own flesh to a hunter as a show of hospitality, and thus they were taken to heaven in a celestial airplane. When the hunter understood their situation in the mode of goodness, he also became renounced, and thus he gave up hunting and went off to perform severe austerities. Because he was freed of all sins, after his body burned to death in a forest fire he was elevated to heaven. Thus many personalities have attained enduring life on higher planets by means of the temporary material body.\u201d"

Thus the \u0101c\u0101rya understands Jar\u0101sandha\u2019s mind as follows: \u201cO weak ones, forget the botheration of fighting. Why not just accept my head? By dressing yourselves as br\u0101hma\u1e47as begging charity, you have made your heroism set like the sun, but if somehow you have not lost your courage, I will give you battle.\u201d The \u0101c\u0101rya finally points out that the goddess of learning intends the phrase amar\u1e63ito mand\u0101\u1e25 to read amar\u1e63ito\u00a0\u2019mand\u0101\u1e25. In other words, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are amand\u0101\u1e25, \u201cnever foolish.\u201d And that is why they chose the best tactic for doing away once and for all with the cruel Jar\u0101sandha."

Their purpose in killing Jar\u0101sandha was to stop him from creating a disturbance to the proper discharge of world peace. A demon always creates disturbances, whereas a demigod always tries to keep peace in the world. The mission of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to give protection to the righteous persons and to kill the demons who disturb a peaceful situation. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately called for the son of Jar\u0101sandha, whose name was Sahadeva, and with due ritualistic ceremonies the Lord asked him to occupy the seat of his father and reign over the kingdom peacefully. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of the whole cosmic creation, and He wants everyone to live peacefully and execute K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. After installing Sahadeva on the throne, He released all the kings and princes who had been imprisoned unnecessarily by Jar\u0101sandha.\u201d"
