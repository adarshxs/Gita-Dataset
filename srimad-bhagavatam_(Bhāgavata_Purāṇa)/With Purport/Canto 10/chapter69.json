When N\u0101rada arrived in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, he saw that the gardens and parks were full of various flowers of different colors and orchards that were overloaded with a variety of fruits. Beautiful birds were chirping, and peacocks were delightfully crowing. There were tanks and ponds full of blue and red lotus flowers, and some of these sites were filled with varieties of lilies. The lakes were full of nice swans and cranes, whose voices resounded everywhere. In the city there were as many as 900,000 great palaces built of first-class marble, with gates and doors made of silver. The posts of the houses and palaces were bedecked with jewels such as touchstone, sapphires and emeralds, and the floors gave off a beautiful luster. The highways, lanes, streets, crossings and marketplaces were all beautifully decorated. The whole city was full of residential homes, assembly houses and temples, all of different architectural beauty. All of this made Dv\u0101rak\u0101 a glowing city. The big avenues, crossings, lanes and streets, and also the thresholds of every residential house, were very clean. On both sides of every path there were bushes, and at regular intervals there were large trees that shaded the avenues so that the sunshine would not bother the passersby.\u201d"

In that palace Tva\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 had arranged canopies with hanging strands of pearls; there were also seats and beds fashioned of ivory and precious jewels. In attendance were many well-dressed maidservants bearing lockets on their necks, and also armor-clad guards with turbans, fine uniforms and jeweled earrings. The glow of numerous jewel-studded lamps dispelled all darkness in the palace. My dear King, on the ornate ridges of the roof danced loudly crying peacocks, who saw the fragrant aguru incense escaping through the holes of the latticed windows and mistook it for a cloud.",

There were many maidservants, all of whom were decorated with gold necklaces, bangles and beautiful s\u0101r\u012bs.

This yaj\u00f1a is also known as pa\u00f1ca-s\u016bn\u0101. Knowingly or unknowingly, everyone, specifically the householder, is committing five kinds of sinful activities. When we receive water from a water pitcher, we kill many germs that are in it. Similarly, when we use a grinding machine or take foodstuffs, we kill many germs. When sweeping the floor or igniting a fire we kill many germs, and when we walk on the street we kill many ants and other insects. Consciously or unconsciously, in all our different activities, we are killing. Therefore, it is incumbent upon every householder to perform the pa\u00f1ca-s\u016bn\u0101 sacrifice to rid himself of the reactions to such sinful activities.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, in his commentary on this verse, again points out that all the different times of the day were occurring simultaneously in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s palaces.

Actually, one is obliged to continue the term of material existence because of household life. But the Lord, being very kind upon householders, demonstrated the path of sanctifying ordinary household life. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the center of all activities, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious householder\u2019s life is transcendental to Vedic injunctions and is automatically sanctified.\u201d As stated in text 2 of this chapter, all the Lord\u2019s activities in the many palaces were performed by the Lord\u2019s single spiritual form (ekena vapu\u1e63\u0101), which manifested in many places at once. This vision was revealed to N\u0101rada because of his desire to see it and the Lord\u2019s desire to show it to him. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b points out that the other residents of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 could see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only in the particular part of the city they themselves occupied, and not anywhere else, even if they would sometimes go to another precinct on some business. Thus the Lord gave a special view of His pastimes to His beloved devotee N\u0101rada Muni."

        "translation": "Lord Hari is the ultimate cause of universal creation, maintenance and destruction. My dear King, anyone who chants about, hears about or simply appreciates the extraordinary activities He performed in this world, which are impossible to imitate, will surely develop devotion for the Supreme Lord, the bestower of liberation.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b has given various meanings for the word ananya-vi\u1e63ay\u0101\u1e47i. This term may indicate that the Lord performed activities in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 that were unusual even for His plenary expansions, to say nothing of others. Or the term can be understood to indicate that the Lord performed these activities for the sake of His pure, exclusive devotees. In any case, one who recites or hears accounts of these pastimes will certainly be engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and, as \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da writes: \u201ccertainly find it very easy to traverse the path of liberation and taste the nectar of the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da further points out that the word anumodate here indicates that one who \u201csupports a preacher of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement\u201d will also receive the benefits mentioned here."
