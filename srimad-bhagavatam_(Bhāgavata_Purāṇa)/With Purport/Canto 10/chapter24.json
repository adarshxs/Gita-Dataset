        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a minimized the importance of the demigods by speaking the philosophy known as Karma-v\u0101da or Karma-m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101, which, basically, is atheism with a belief in reincarnation. According to this philosophy, there are subtle laws of nature that reward or punish us according to how we act: \u201cAs you sow, so shall you reap.\u201d In a future life one reaps the fruit of his present work, and this is the sum and substance of reality. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being God Himself, could hardly be a serious proponent of this mediocre philosophy. In the role of a young boy He was simply teasing His pure devotees by preaching it. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b points out that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was thinking, \u201cWhy are these eternal associates of Mine, appearing as My father and other relatives and friends, so caught up in this worship of Indra?\u201d Thus although the Lord\u2019s main purpose was to take away the false pride of Indra, He also wanted to remind His eternal devotees that they need not divert their attention to other so-called gods, since in fact His devotees were already living with the Supreme Absolute Truth, the almighty Lord Himself."

This superficial argument neglects the obvious point that the laws of nature that prescribe the good and bad results of pious and impious acts are themselves creations of the all-good Supreme Lord. Being the creator and sustainer of these laws, the Lord is not subject to them. Furthermore, the Lord is not dependent on the work of the conditioned souls, since He is satisfied and complete within Himself. Out of His all-merciful nature He awards the results appropriate to our activities. That which we call destiny, fate or karma is an elaborate and subtle system of rewards and punishments meant for gradually encouraging conditioned souls to evolve to the stage of perfect consciousness, which is their original, constitutional nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has so dexterously formulated and applied the laws of material nature governing punishment and reward for human behavior that the living being is discouraged from sin and encouraged toward goodness without suffering any significant interference with his free will as an eternal soul. In contrast to the material nature, the Lord exhibits His essential nature in the spiritual world, where He reciprocates the eternal love of His pure devotees. Such loving affairs are based completely on the mutual freedom of the Lord and His devotees, not on a mechanical reciprocation of coinciding selfish interests. The Supreme Lord, assisted by His pure devotees, repeatedly offers the conditioned souls of this world the opportunity to give up their bizarre attempt at exploiting the material universe and go back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Considering all these points, the atheistic arguments given here by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a playful mood are not to be taken seriously."

If one accepts the existence of karma as a system of laws awarding reactions for our present activities, then we ourselves, according to our nature, will decide our future. Our happiness and distress in this life have already been adjudicated and fixed according to our previous activities, and not even the demigods can change that. They must award us the prosperity or poverty, sickness or health, happiness or distress due us by our previous work. However, we still retain the freedom to select a pious or impious mode of activity in this life, and the choice we make will determine our future suffering and enjoyment. For example, if I was pious in my last life, in this life the demigods may award me great material wealth. But I am free to spend my riches for good or for bad purposes, and my choice will determine my future life. Thus, although no one can change the karmic results due him in this life, everyone still retains his free will, by which he determines what his future situation will be. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s argument here is quite interesting; however, it neglects the overriding consideration that we are all eternal servants of God and must satisfy Him by all that we do."

That Indra himself is subordinate to the laws of karma is explicitly stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.54): yas tv indra-gopam atha vendram aho sva-karma-bandh\u0101nur\u016bpa-phala-bh\u0101janam \u0101tanoti. The Supreme Lord, Govinda, awards all creatures the appropriate results of their work. This is as true for mighty Indra, the lord of the material heavens, as it is for the germ called indra-gopa. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20) also states, k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante\u00a0\u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25. Only those who have lost their intelligence because of various material desires surrender unto demigods rather than worship the Supreme Lord.

All benefits are ultimately issued by the Lord Himself. Thus it is not altogether incorrect to say that demigod worship is useless, since even the demigods are under the laws of karma. In fact, this is the case. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Absolute Truth, is not subordinate to the law of karma; rather, He can independently offer or withhold His favor. This is confirmed in the verse from the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 quoted above, the third line of which is karm\u0101\u1e47i nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bh\u0101j\u0101m: \u201cThe Supreme Lord burns up all the accumulated karma of those engaged in His loving service.\u201d Not only is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a above the laws of material action and reaction, but He can immediately dissolve these laws for anyone who satisfies Him through loving service. Thus the almighty God is supreme in absolute freedom, and by surrendering to Him we can escape the bonds of karma and stop accepting their dismal rule as supreme."

The followers of the Krsna consciousness movement may therefore collect small rocks or pebbles from Govardhana Hill and worship them at home, because this worship is as good as Deity worship.\u201d Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had induced the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to assume a significant risk on His behalf. He convinced them to neglect a sacrifice to what is, after all, the powerful government of the universe and to worship a hill called Govardhana instead. The cowherd community did all this simply out of love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and now to convince them that their decision was correct, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared in an unprecedented, huge transcendental form and demonstrated that He Himself was Govardhana Hill."

        "translation": "The members of the cowherd community, having thus been inspired by Lord V\u0101sudeva to properly execute the sacrifice to Govardhana Hill, the cows and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, returned with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to their village, Vraja.",
        "purport": " Although the Govardhana-p\u016bj\u0101 was performed in a blissful and successful way, the matter was hardly finished. Lord Indra is, after all, tremendously powerful, and he received the news of the Govardhana sacrifice with burning anger. What ensued will be described in the following chapter."
