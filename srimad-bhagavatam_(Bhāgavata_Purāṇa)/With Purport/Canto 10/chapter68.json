        "purport": " In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da explains this event as follows: \u201cDuryodhana, the son of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, had a marriageable daughter by the name of Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47\u0101. She was a very highly qualified girl of the Kuru dynasty, and many princes wanted to marry her. In such cases the svaya\u1e41vara ceremony is held so that the girl may select her husband according to her own choice. In Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47\u0101\u2019s svaya\u1e41vara assembly, when the girl was to select her husband, S\u0101mba appeared. He was the son of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by J\u0101mbavat\u012b, one of the chief wives of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This son S\u0101mba is so named because, being a very bad child, he always lived close to his mother. The name S\u0101mba indicates that this son was very much his mother\u2019s pet. Amb\u0101 means \u201cmother,\u201d and sa means \u201cwith.\u201d So this special name was given to him because he always remained with his mother. He was also known as J\u0101mbavat\u012b-suta for the same reason. As previously explained, all the sons of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were as qualified as their great father, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. S\u0101mba wanted the daughter of Duryodhana, Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47\u0101, although she was not inclined to have him. Therefore S\u0101mba kidnapped Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47\u0101 by force from the svaya\u1e41vara ceremony.\u201d"

When S\u0101mba forcibly took away Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a, the elderly members of the Kuru dynasty were pleased to see that he was actually the suitable match for her. In order to see his personal strength, however, they fought with him, and without any respect for the regulations of fighting, they all arrested him. When the Yadu dynasty decided to release S\u0101mba from the confinement of the Kurus, Lord Balar\u0101ma came personally to settle the matter, and, as a powerful k\u1e63atriya, He ordered them to free S\u0101mba immediately. The Kauravas became superficially insulted by this order, so they challenged Lord Balar\u0101ma\u2019s power. They simply wanted to see Him exhibit His inconceivable strength. Thus with great pleasure they handed over their daughter to S\u0101mba, and the whole matter was settled. Duryodhana, being affectionate toward his daughter Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47\u0101, had her married to S\u0101mba in great pomp.\u2026 Balar\u0101ma was very satisfied after His great reception from the side of the Kurus, and accompanied by the newly married couple, He started toward His capital city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. \u201cLord Balar\u0101ma triumphantly reached Dv\u0101rak\u0101, where He met with many citizens who were all His devotees and friends. When they all assembled, Lord Balar\u0101ma narrated the whole story of the marriage, and they were astonished to hear how Balar\u0101ma had made the city of Hastin\u0101pura tremble.\u201d"
