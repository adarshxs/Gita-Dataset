K\u0101la is actually another name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead when He appears only for the purpose of killing. When Arjuna inquired from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His universal form, \u201cWho are You?\u201d the Lord presented Himself as k\u0101la, death personified to kill. By nature\u2019s law, when there is an unwanted increase in population, k\u0101la appears, and by some arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, people are killed wholesale in different ways, by war, pestilence, famine and so on. At that time, even atheistic political leaders go to a church, mosque or temple for protection by God or gods and submissively say, \u201cGod willing.\u201d Before that, they pay no attention to God, not caring to know God or His will, but when k\u0101la appears, they say \u201cGod willing.\u201d Death is but another feature of the supreme k\u0101la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the time of death, the atheist must submit to this supreme k\u0101la, and then the Supreme Personality of Godhead takes away all his possessions (m\u1e5btyu\u1e25 sarva-hara\u015b c\u0101ham) and forces him to accept another body (tath\u0101 deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101pti\u1e25). This the atheists do not know, and if they do know, they neglect it so that they may go on with their normal life. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is trying to teach them that although for a few years one may act as a great protector or great watchman, with the appearance of k\u0101la, death, one must take another body by the laws of nature. Not knowing this, they unnecessarily waste their time in their occupation as watchdogs and do not try to get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is clearly said, apr\u0101pya m\u0101\u1e41 nivartante m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani: without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one is condemned to continue wandering in birth and death, not knowing what will happen in one\u2019s next birth."

Then she wanted to compromise with him by saying that whatever he had done was not his fault, but was ordained by destiny. Then she appealed to him to give her the daughter as a gift. Devak\u012b was the daughter of a k\u1e63atriya and knew how to play the political game. In politics there are different methods of achieving success: first repression (dama), then compromise (s\u0101ma), and then asking for a gift (d\u0101na). Devak\u012b first adopted the policy of repression by directly attacking Ka\u1e41sa for having cruelly, atrociously killed her babies. Then she compromised by saying that this was not his fault, and then she begged for a gift. As we learn from the history of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, or \u201cGreater India,\u201d the wives and daughters of the ruling class, the k\u1e63atriyas, knew the political game, but we never find that a woman was given the post of chief executive. This is in accordance with the injunctions of Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, but unfortunately Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 is now being insulted, and the \u0100ryans, the members of Vedic society, cannot do anything. Such is the nature of Kali-yuga. Nothing happens unless ordained by destiny. Devak\u012b knew very well that because the killing of her many children had been ordained by destiny, Ka\u1e41sa was not to be blamed. There was no need to give good instructions to Ka\u1e41sa. Upade\u015bo hi murkh\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 prakop\u0101ya na \u015b\u0101ntaye (C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita). If a foolish person is given good instructions, he becomes more and more angry. Moreover, a cruel person is more dangerous than a snake. A snake and a cruel person are both cruel, but a cruel person is more dangerous because although a snake can be charmed by mantras or subdued by herbs, a cruel person cannot be subdued by any means. Such was the nature of Ka\u1e41sa."

Her devotees are known as \u015b\u0101ktas, or worshipers of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas worshipers of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself are called Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are destined to return home, back to Godhead, in the spiritual world, whereas the \u015b\u0101ktas are destined to live within this material world to enjoy different types of material happiness. In the material world, the living entity must accept different types of bodies. Bhr\u0101mayan sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni yantr\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101ni m\u0101yay\u0101 (Bg. 18.61).

The appearance of Durg\u0101 in her original eight-armed feature, holding various weapons, immediately changed Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s mind about Devak\u012b\u2019s being an ordinary human. Devak\u012b must have had some transcendental qualities; otherwise why would the goddess Durg\u0101 have taken birth from her womb?

        "purport": " Although Ka\u1e41sa is described as a demon, he had good knowledge of the affairs of \u0101tma-tattva, the truth of the self. Five thousand years ago, there were kings like Ka\u1e41sa, who is described as an asura, but he was better than modern politicians and diplomats, who have no knowledge about \u0101tma-tattva. As stated in the Vedas, asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25: the spirit soul has no connection with the changes of the material body. The body undergoes six changes \u2014 birth, growth, sustenance, by-products, dwindling and then annihilation \u2014 but the soul undergoes no such changes. Even after the annihilation of a particular bodily form, the original source of the bodily elements does not change. The living entity enjoys the material body, which appears and disappears, but the five elements earth, water, fire, air and ether remain the same. The example given here is that pots and dolls are produced from the earth, and when broken or destroyed they mingle with their original ingredients. In any case, the source of supply remains the same. As already discussed, the body is made according to the desires of the soul. The soul desires, and thus the body is formed. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61): \u201cThe Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.\u201d Neither the Supersoul, Param\u0101tm\u0101, nor the individual soul changes its original, spiritual identity. The \u0101tm\u0101 does not undergo birth, death or changes like the body. Therefore a Vedic aphorism says, asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25: although the soul is conditioned within this material world, he has no connections with the changes of the material body."

        "purport": " As confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.6): The word dharma means \u201cengagement.\u201d One who is engaged in the service of the Lord (yato bhaktir adhok\u1e63aje), without impediment and without cessation, is understood to be situated in his original, spiritual status. When one is promoted to this status, one is always happy in transcendental bliss. Otherwise, as long as one is in the bodily concept of life, one must suffer material conditions. Janma-m\u1e5btyu jar\u0101-vy\u0101dhi-du\u1e25kha-do\u1e63\u0101nudar\u015banam. The body is subject to its own principles of birth, death, old age and disease, but one who is situated in spiritual life (yato bhaktir adhok\u1e63aje) has no birth, no death, no old age and no disease. One may argue that we may see a person who is spiritually engaged twenty-four hours a day but is still suffering from disease. In fact, however, he is neither suffering nor diseased; otherwise he could not be engaged twenty-four hours a day in spiritual activities. The example may be given in this connection that sometimes dirty foam or garbage is seen floating on the water of the Ganges. This is called n\u012bra-dharma, a function of the water. But one who goes to the Ganges does not mind the foam and dirty things floating in the water. With his hand, he pushes away such nasty things, bathes in the Ganges and gains the beneficial results. Therefore, one who is situated in the spiritual status of life is unaffected by foam and garbage \u2014 or any superficial dirty things. This is confirmed by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: \u201cA person acting in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with his body, mind and words is a liberated person, even within the material world.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.187) Therefore, one is forbidden to regard the guru as an ordinary human being (guru\u1e63u nara-matir \u2026 n\u0101rak\u012b sa\u1e25). The spiritual master, or \u0101c\u0101rya, is always situated in the spiritual status of life. Birth, death, old age and disease do not affect him. According to the Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa, therefore, after the disappearance of an \u0101c\u0101rya, his body is never burnt to ashes, for it is a spiritual body. The spiritual body is always unaffected by material conditions."

He is the leader of all the demigods because all the demigods, including Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101, exist under His protection. The great saintly persons, sages and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas also depend upon Him. To persecute the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, therefore, is the only way to kill Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.",
        "purport": " The demigods and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas especially are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, because they are always obedient to His orders (o\u1e41 tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 pada\u1e41 sad\u0101 pa\u015byanti s\u016braya\u1e25). The demoniac followers of Ka\u1e41sa thought that if the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, saintly persons and sages were persecuted, the original body of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u would naturally be destroyed. Thus they decided to suppress Vai\u1e63\u1e47avism. The asuras perpetually struggle to persecute the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas because they do not want Vai\u1e63\u1e47avism to spread. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas preach only devotional service, not encouraging karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs, because if one must liberate oneself from material, conditional life, one must ultimately become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is directed with this understanding, and therefore the asuras always try to suppress it."

Instead of taking good instructions from the sages and the \u015b\u0101stras, godless nondevotees act whimsically, according to their own plans. Actually, however, no one has his own plans because everyone is bound by the laws of nature and must act according to his tendency in material, conditional life. Therefore one must change one\u2019s own decision and follow the decision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees. Then one is rescued from punishment by Yamar\u0101ja. Ka\u1e41sa was not uneducated. It appears from his talks with Vasudeva and Devak\u012b that he knew all about the laws of nature. But because of his association with bad ministers, he could not make a clear decision about his welfare. Therefore the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.54) says: If one desires his real welfare, he must associate with devotees and saintly persons and in this way rectify the material condition of his life."
