Earth is raised up on both sides of a river or canal so that the water will not deviate from its proper path. Similarly, God establishes laws so that people who follow them can peacefully progress along the path back home, back to Godhead. These laws, which are meant to guide human behavior, are thus called setu. A further note on the word setu: Earth that is raised up to separate agricultural fields, or to form a causeway or bridge, is also called setu. Thus in the Ninth Canto the Bh\u0101gavatam uses the word setu to indicate the bridge Lord R\u0101macandra built to \u015ar\u012b La\u1e45k\u0101. Since the laws of God act as a bridge to take us from material life to liberated, spiritual life, this additional sense of the word setu certainly enriches its use here."

Of course, as stated in the beginning of the Tenth Canto, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared specifically because the earth was overburdened by innumerable bogus kings and He wanted to remove this burden. Finally \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b points out that the word tyakta-n\u1e5bp\u0101san\u0101n, \u201cgiving up the king\u2019s throne,\u201d indicates that after Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a killed Ka\u1e41sa He humbly gave the royal throne to His grandfather Ugrasena, although the Lord Himself was entitled to it."

        "purport": " In text 12 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said, r\u0101jabhyo bibhyata\u1e25 su-bhru samudram \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 gat\u0101n: \u201cOut of fear of the kings, We took shelter in the ocean.\u201d Here \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Rukmi\u1e47\u012b-dev\u012b points out that the actual rulers of this world are the gu\u1e47as, the material modes of nature, which impel all living beings to act. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b points out that because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fears that His devotee will come under the influence of the modes of nature and become entangled in sense gratification, He enters the internal ocean of their hearts, where He remains as the omniscient Supersoul (upalambhana-m\u0101tra \u0101tm\u0101). Thus He protects His devotees. The word upalambhana-m\u0101tra\u1e25 also indicates that the Lord is the object of meditation for His devotees. In text 12 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also said, balavadbhi\u1e25 k\u1e5bta-dve\u1e63\u0101n: \u201cWe created enmity with the powerful.\u201d Here \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Rukmi\u1e47\u012b-dev\u012b points out that it is the material senses which are actually powerful in this world. The Supreme Lord has taken up the battle against sense gratification on the part of His devotees, and thus He is constantly trying to help them in their struggle for spiritual purity. When the devotees become free of unwanted material habits, the Lord reveals Himself to them, and then the eternal loving relationship between the Lord and His devotees becomes an irrevocable fact. In the same verse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stated, tyakta-n\u1e5bp\u0101san\u0101n: \u201cWe renounced the royal throne.\u201d But here \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Rukmi\u1e47\u012b-dev\u012b points out that the position of political supremacy in this world usually implicates so-called powerful leaders in darkness and blindness. As the saying goes, \u201cPower corrupts.\u201d Thus even the Lord\u2019s loving servants tend to shy away from political intrigue and power politics. The Lord Himself, being completely satisfied in His own spiritual bliss, would hardly be interested in occupying mundane political positions. Thus \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Rukmi\u1e47\u012b-dev\u012b correctly interprets the Lord\u2019s actions as evidence of His supreme transcendental nature."

        "purport": " Here \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b Rukmi\u1e47\u012b-dev\u012b replies to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statement in text 14: \u201cWe have no material possessions, and We are dear to those who similarly have nothing. Therefore, O slender one, the wealthy hardly ever worship Me.\u201d Queen Rukmi\u1e47\u012b begins her statement by saying ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cano nanu, \u201cYou are indeed ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana.\u201d The word ki\u00f1cana means \u201csomething,\u201d and the prefix nir \u2014 or, as it appears here, ni\u1e63 \u2014 indicates negation. Thus in the ordinary sense ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana means \u201cone who does not have something,\u201d or, in other words, \u201cone who has nothing.\u201d But in the present verse Queen Rukmi\u1e47\u012b states that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u201cpossesses nothing\u201d not because He is a pauper but because He Himself is everything. In other words, since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Absolute Truth, all that exists is within Him. There is no second thing, something outside the Lord\u2019s existence, for Him to possess. For example, a man may possess a house or a car or a child or money, but these things do not become the man: they exist outside of him. We say he possesses them merely in the sense that he has control over them. But the Lord does not merely control His creation: His creation actually exists within Him. Thus there is nothing outside of Him that He can possess in the way that we possess external objects. The \u0101c\u0101ryas explain ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana in the following way: To state that a person possesses something implies that he does not possess everything. In other words, if we say that a man owns some property, we imply that he does not own all property but rather some specific property. A standard American dictionary defines the word some as \u201ca certain indefinite or unspecified number, quantity, etc., as distinguished from the rest.\u201d The Sanskrit word ki\u00f1cana conveys this sense of a partial amount of the total. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana to refute the idea that He possesses merely a certain amount of beauty, fame, wealth, intelligence and other opulences. Rather, He possesses infinite beauty, infinite intelligence, infinite wealth and so on. This is so because He is the Absolute Truth. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da begins his introduction to the First Canto, Volume One, of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam with the following statement, which is quite relevant to our present discussion: \u201cThe conception of God and the conception of the Absolute Truth are not on the same level. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam hits on the target of the Absolute Truth. The conception of God indicates the controller, whereas the conception of the Absolute Truth indicates the summum bonum, or the ultimate source of all energies.\u201d Here \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da touches upon a fundamental philosophical point. God is commonly defined as \u201cthe supreme being,\u201d and the dictionary defines supreme as (1) highest in rank, power, authority, etc; (2) highest in quality, achievement, performance, etc; (3) highest in degree; and (4) final, ultimate. None of these definitions adequately indicates absolute existence. For example, we may say that a particular American is supremely wealthy in the sense that he is wealthier than any other American, or we may speak of the Supreme Court as the highest court in the land, although it certainly does not have absolute authority in all political and social matters, since it shares authority in these fields with the legislature and the president. In other words, the word supreme indicates the best in a hierarchy, and thus the supreme being may merely be understood as the best or greatest of all beings but not as the very source of all other beings and, indeed, of everything that exists. Thus \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da specifically points out that the concept of the Absolute Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is higher than the concept of a supreme being, and this point is essential to a clear understanding of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not merely a supreme being: He is the absolute being, and that is exactly the point His wife is making. Thus the word ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana indicates not that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a possesses no opulence but rather all opulence. In that sense she accepts His definition of Himself as ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana. In text 14 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also stated, ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana-jana-priy\u0101\u1e25: \u201cI am dear to those who have nothing.\u201d Here, however, Queen Rukmi\u1e47\u012b points out that the demigods, the wealthiest souls in the universe, regularly make offerings to the Supreme Lord. We may assume that the demigods, being the Lord\u2019s appointed representatives, know that everything belongs to Him in the sense that everything is part of Him, as explained above. Therefore the statement ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana-jana-priy\u0101\u1e25 is correct in the sense that since nothing exists except the Lord and His potencies, no matter how wealthy the Lord\u2019s worshipers appear to be they are in fact offering Him nothing but His own energy as a loving act. The same idea is exemplified when one worships the Ganges River by offering Ganges water, or when a child gets money from his father on the father\u2019s birthday and buys him a gift. The father is paying for his own present, but what he is really interested in is his child\u2019s love. Similarly, the Supreme Lord manifests the cosmos, and then the conditioned souls collect various items of the Lord\u2019s creation. Pious souls offer some of the best items from their collection back to the Lord as a sacrifice and thus purify themselves. Since the whole cosmos and everything in it is simply the Lord\u2019s energy, we may say that those who worship the Lord possess nothing. In more conventional terms, people who are proud of their great wealth do not bow down to God. Queen Rukmi\u1e47\u012b also mentions these fools. Satisfied with their temporary bodies, they do not understand the divine power of death, which stalks them. The demigods, however, who are by far the wealthiest living beings, regularly offer sacrifice to the Supreme Lord, and thus the Lord is most dear to them, as stated here."

It was not a blind choice at all.\u201d Rukmi\u1e47\u012b further mentions that she passed over lesser personalities like Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and the rulers of heaven because she saw that even though, materially speaking, they are great personalities, they are frustrated by the powerful waves of time, which emanate from the eyebrows of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, far from lacking foresight, Rukmi\u1e47\u012b chose Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a after an exhaustive appraisal of the entire cosmic situation. Thus she lovingly rebukes her husband here. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b interprets Rukmi\u1e47\u012b\u2019s mood as follows: \u201cMy dear husband, Your accusation that I lack foresight indicates that You did know of my deep insight into the situation. Actually, I chose You because I knew of Your true glories.\u201d"

        "purport": " It stands to reason that since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of all pleasure and all opulence, He Himself is the supreme pleasure and the most opulent. Therefore our real self-interest is to always engage in the loving service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja says (Bh\u0101g. 7.5.31), na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um: \u201cThe ignorant do not know that their actual self-interest lies in attaining the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a].\u201d According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, one can easily obtain female association and other sense pleasures even in hell. We have practical experience that even such creatures as hogs, dogs and pigeons have ample opportunity to enjoy sex. It is unfortunate that modern human beings, who have a golden opportunity to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, prefer to enjoy like dogs and cats. And this goes on in the name of material progress."
