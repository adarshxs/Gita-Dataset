        "translation": "Thereafter, at the auspicious time for the appearance of the Lord, the entire universe was surcharged with all the qualities of goodness, beauty and peace. The constellation Rohi\u1e47\u012b appeared, as did stars like A\u015bvin\u012b. The sun, the moon and the other stars and planets were very peaceful. All directions appeared extremely pleasing, and the beautiful stars twinkled in the cloudless sky. Decorated with towns, villages, mines and pasturing grounds, the earth seemed all-auspicious. The rivers flowed with clear water, and the lakes and vast reservoirs, full of lilies and lotuses, were extraordinarily beautiful. In the trees and green plants, full of flowers and leaves, pleasing to the eyes, birds like cuckoos and swarms of bees began chanting with sweet voices for the sake of the demigods. A pure breeze began to blow, pleasing the sense of touch and bearing the aroma of flowers, and when the br\u0101hma\u1e47as engaging in ritualistic ceremonies ignited their fires according to Vedic principles, the fires burned steadily, undisturbed by the breeze. Thus when the birthless Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was about to appear, the saints and br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who had always been disturbed by demons like Ka\u1e41sa and his men, felt peace within the core of their hearts, and kettledrums simultaneously vibrated from the upper planetary system.",
        "purport": " As stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that His appearance, birth, and activities are all transcendental and that one who factually understands them is immediately eligible to be transferred to the spiritual world. The Lord\u2019s appearance or birth is not like that of an ordinary man, who is forced to accept a material body according to his past deeds. The Lord\u2019s appearance is explained in the previous chapter: He appears out of His own sweet pleasure. When the time was mature for the appearance of the Lord, the constellations became very auspicious. The astrological influence of the constellation known as Rohi\u1e47\u012b was also predominant because this constellation is considered very auspicious. Rohi\u1e47\u012b is under the direct supervision of Brahm\u0101, who is born of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and it appears at the birth of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who in fact is birthless. According to the astrological conclusion, besides the proper situation of the stars, there are auspicious and inauspicious moments due to the different situations of the different planetary systems. At the time of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth, the planetary systems were automatically adjusted so that everything became auspicious. At that time, in all directions, east, west, south, north, everywhere, there was an atmosphere of peace and prosperity. Auspicious stars were visible in the sky, and on the surface in all towns and villages or pasturing grounds and within the mind of everyone there were signs of good fortune. The rivers were flowing full of water, and the lakes were beautifully decorated with lotus flowers. The forests were full with beautiful birds and peacocks. All the birds within the forests began to sing with sweet voices, and the peacocks began to dance with their consorts. The wind blew very pleasantly, carrying the aroma of different flowers, and the sensation of bodily touch was very pleasing. At home, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who were accustomed to offer sacrifices in the fire, found their homes very pleasant for offerings. Because of disturbances created by the demoniac kings, the sacrificial fire had been almost stopped in the houses of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but now they could find the opportunity to start the fire peacefully. Being forbidden to offer sacrifices, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were very distressed in mind, intelligence and activities. But just on the point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance, automatically their minds became full of joy because they could hear loud vibrations in the sky of transcendental sounds proclaiming the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. On the occasion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth, seasonal changes took place throughout the entire universe. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was born during the month of September, yet it appeared like springtime. The atmosphere, however, was very cool, although not chilly, and the rivers and reservoirs appeared just as they would in \u015barat, the fall. Lotuses and lilies blossom during the day, but although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared at twelve o\u2019clock midnight, the lilies and lotuses were in bloom, and thus the wind blowing at that time was full of fragrance. Because of Ka\u1e41sa\u2019s disturbances, the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies had almost stopped. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as and saintly persons could not execute the Vedic rituals with peaceful minds. But now the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were very pleased to perform their daily ritualistic ceremonies undisturbed. The business of the asuras is to disturb the suras, the devotees and br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but at the time of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance these devotees and br\u0101hma\u1e47as were undisturbed."

        "translation": "The demigods and great saintly persons showered flowers in a joyous mood, and clouds gathered in the sky and very mildly thundered, making sounds like those of the ocean\u2019s waves. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is situated in the core of everyone\u2019s heart, appeared from the heart of Devak\u012b in the dense darkness of night, like the full moon rising on the eastern horizon, because Devak\u012b was of the same category as \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",
        "purport": " As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37): This verse indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His entourage are of the same spiritual potency (\u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s father, His mother, His friends the cowherd boys, and the cows are all expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as will be explained in the brahma-vimohana-l\u012bl\u0101. When Brahm\u0101 took away K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s associates to test the supremacy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord expanded Himself again in the forms of the many cowherd boys and calves, all of whom, as Brahm\u0101 saw, were vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brtis. Devak\u012b is also an expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore this verse says, devaky\u0101\u1e41 deva-r\u016bpi\u1e47y\u0101\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25 sarva-guh\u0101-\u015baya\u1e25. At the time for the Lord\u2019s appearance, the great sages and the demigods, being pleased, began to shower flowers. At the seashore, there was the sound of mild waves, and above the sea there were clouds in the sky which began to thunder very pleasingly. When things were adjusted like this, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is residing within the heart of every living entity, appeared in the darkness of night as the Supreme Personality of Godhead before Devak\u012b, who appeared as one of the demigoddesses. The appearance of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u at that time could be compared to the rising of the full moon in the sky on the eastern horizon. The objection may be raised that since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared on the eighth day of the waning moon, there could be no rising of the full moon. In answer to this it may be said that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared in the dynasty which is in the hierarchy of the moon; therefore, although the moon was incomplete on that night, because of the Lord\u2019s appearance in the dynasty wherein the moon is himself the original person, the moon was in an overjoyous condition, so by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he could appear as a full moon. To welcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the waning moon became a full moon in jubilation. Instead of deva-r\u016bpi\u1e47y\u0101m, some texts of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam clearly say vi\u1e63\u1e47u-r\u016bpi\u1e47y\u0101m. In either case, the meaning is that Devak\u012b has the same spiritual form as the Lord. The Lord is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, and Devak\u012b is also sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. Therefore no one can find any fault in the way the Supreme Personality of Godhead, sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, appeared from the womb of Devak\u012b. Those who are not in full knowledge that the appearance and disappearance of the Lord are transcendental (janma karma ca me divyam) are sometimes surprised that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can take birth like an ordinary child. Actually, however, the Lord\u2019s birth is never ordinary. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is already situated within the core of everyone\u2019s heart as antary\u0101m\u012b, the Supersoul. Thus because He was present in full potency in Devak\u012b\u2019s heart, He was also able to appear outside her body. One of the twelve great personalities is Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva (svayambh\u016br n\u0101rada\u1e25 \u015bambhu\u1e25 kum\u0101ra\u1e25 kapilo manu\u1e25 prahl\u0101da, janako bh\u012b\u1e63ma\u1e25). In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.9.42), Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, a great authority to be followed by devotees, says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in the core of everyone\u2019s heart, just as the sun may be on everyone\u2019s head. Yet although the sun may be on the heads of millions and millions of people, this does not mean that the sun is variously situated. Similarly, because the Supreme Personality of Godhead has inconceivable potencies, He can be within everyone\u2019s heart and yet not be situated variously. Ekatvam anupa\u015byata\u1e25 (\u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad 7). The Lord is one, but He can appear in everyone\u2019s heart by His inconceivable potency. Thus although the Lord was within the heart of Devak\u012b, He appeared as her child. According to the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, therefore, as quoted in the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b, the Lord appeared like the sun (anugrah\u0101saya). The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.35) confirms that the Lord is situated even within the atom (a\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham). He is situated in Mathur\u0101, in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and in the core of the heart. Therefore one should clearly understand that He did not live like an ordinary child in the heart or the womb of Devak\u012b. Nor did He appear like an ordinary human child, although He seemed to do so in order to bewilder asuras like Ka\u1e41sa. The asuras wrongly think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took birth like an ordinary child and passed away from this world like an ordinary man. Such asuric conceptions are rejected by persons in knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ajo\u00a0\u2019pi sann avyay\u0101tm\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m \u012b\u015bvaro\u00a0\u2019pi san (Bg. 4.6). As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord is aja, unborn, and He is the supreme controller of everything. Nonetheless, He appeared as the child of Devak\u012b. This verse describes the inconceivable potency of the Lord, who appeared like the full moon. Understanding the special significance of the appearance of the Supreme Godhead, one should never regard Him as having taken birth like an ordinary child."

Vasudeva was shivering with wonder to see a newborn child decorated so nicely with valuable garments and gems. He could immediately understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had appeared, not as an ordinary child but in His original, fully decorated, four-handed form. The first wonder was that the Lord was not afraid to appear within the prison house of Ka\u1e41sa, where Vasudeva and Devak\u012b were interned. Second, although the Lord, the Supreme Transcendence, is all-pervading, He had appeared from the womb of Devak\u012b. The third point of wonder, therefore, was that a child could take birth from the womb so nicely decorated. Fourth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was Vasudeva\u2019s worshipable Deity yet had taken birth as his son. For all these reasons, Vasudeva was transcendentally jubilant, and he wanted to perform a festival, as k\u1e63atriyas do to celebrate the birth of a child, but because of his imprisonment he was unable to do it externally, and therefore he performed the festival within his mind. This was just as good. If one cannot externally serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can serve the Lord within one\u2019s mind, since the activities of the mind are as good as those of the other senses. This is called the nondual or absolute situation (advaya j\u00f1\u0101na). People generally perform ritualistic ceremonies for the birth of a child. Why then should Vasudeva not have performed such a ceremony when the Supreme Lord appeared as his son?"

        "translation": "My Lord, You are the same person who in the beginning created this material world by His personal external energy. After the creation of this world of three gu\u1e47as [sattva, rajas and tamas], You appear to have entered it, although in fact You have not.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.4) the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains: This material world of three modes of nature \u2014 sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a \u2014 is a composition of earth, water, fire, air, mind, intelligence and false ego, all of which are energies coming from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, yet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being always transcendental, is aloof from this material world. Those who are not in pure knowledge think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a product of matter and that His body is material like ours (avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25). In fact, however, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always aloof from this material world. In the Vedic literature, we find the creation described in relationship to Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.35): \u201cI worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, the original Personality of Godhead. By His partial plenary expansion as Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, He enters into material nature. Then He enters every universe as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and He enters all the elements, including every atom of matter, as K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Such manifestations of cosmic creation are innumerable, both in the universes and in the individual atoms.\u201d Govinda is partially exhibited as antary\u0101m\u012b, the Supersoul, who enters this material world (a\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha) and who is also within the atom. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.48) further says: This verse describes Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as a plenary expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u lies on the Causal Ocean, and when He exhales, millions of brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0das, or universes, come from the pores of His body. Then, when Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u inhales, all these brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0das disappear. Thus the millions of brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0das controlled by the Brahm\u0101s and other demigods come and go in this material world through the breathing of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Foolish persons think that when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears as the son of Vasudeva, He is limited like an ordinary child. But Vasudeva was aware that although the Lord had appeared as his son, the Lord had not entered Devak\u012b\u2019s womb and then come out. Rather, the Lord was always there. The Supreme Lord is all-pervading, present within and without. Pravi\u1e63\u1e6da iva bh\u0101vyase: He only seemed to have entered the womb of Devak\u012b and to have now appeared as Vasudeva\u2019s child. The expression of this knowledge by Vasudeva indicates that Vasudeva knew how these events took place. Vasudeva was certainly a devotee of the Lord in full knowledge, and we must learn from devotees like him. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.34) therefore recommends: \u201cJust try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201d Vasudeva begot the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet he was in full knowledge of how the Supreme Lord appears and disappears. He was therefore tattva-dar\u015b\u012b, a seer of the truth, because he personally saw how the Supreme Absolute Truth appeared as his son. Vasudeva was not in ignorance, thinking that because the Supreme Godhead had appeared as his son, the Lord had become limited. The Lord is unlimitedly existing and all-pervading, inside and outside. Thus there is no question of His appearance or disappearance."

        "translation": "The mahat-tattva, the total material energy, is undivided, but because of the material modes of nature, it appears to separate into earth, water, fire, air and ether. Because of the living energy [j\u012bva-bh\u016bta], these separated energies combine to make the cosmic manifestation visible, but in fact, before the creation of the cosmos, the total energy is already present. Therefore, the total material energy never actually enters the creation. Similarly, although You are perceived by our senses because of Your presence, You cannot be perceived by the senses, nor experienced by the mind or words [av\u0101\u1e45-m\u0101nasa-gocara]. With our senses we can perceive some things, but not everything; for example, we can use our eyes to see, but not to taste. Consequently, You are beyond perception by the senses. Although in touch with the modes of material nature, You are unaffected by them. You are the prime factor in everything, the all-pervading, undivided Supersoul. For You, therefore, there is no external or internal. You never entered the womb of Devak\u012b; rather, You existed there already.",
        "purport": " This same understanding is explained by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.4): \u201cBy Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses. It is said that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38): One can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always, within oneself and outside oneself, if one has developed the transcendental loving attitude toward Him. Thus for people in general, He is not visible. In the above-mentioned verse from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, therefore, it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is not conceivable by the material senses. But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As discussed in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies, the superior, spiritual energy and the inferior, material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy. Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence. To refute such arguments, the Lord says, \u201cI am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof.\u201d For example, a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king\u2019s energy; the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king\u2019s power. But still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see, and everything that exists, both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of His different energies, and, as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, He is everywhere present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies. One may argue that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who creates the whole cosmic manifestation simply by His glance, cannot come within the womb of Devak\u012b, the wife of Vasudeva. To eradicate this argument, Vasudeva said, \u201cMy dear Lord, it is not very wonderful that You appeared within the womb of Devak\u012b, for the creation was also made in that way. You were lying in the Causal Ocean as Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and by Your breathing, innumerable universes came into existence. Then You entered into each of the universes as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Then again You expanded Yourself as K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and entered into the heart of all living entities and entered even within the atoms. Therefore Your entrance into the womb of Devak\u012b is understandable in the same way. You appear to have entered, but You are simultaneously all-pervading. We can understand Your entrance and nonentrance from material examples. The total material energy remains intact even after being divided into sixteen elements. The material body is nothing but a combination of the five gross elements \u2014 namely earth, water, fire, air and ether. Whenever there is a material body, it appears that such elements are newly created, but actually the elements are always existing outside of the body. Similarly, although You appear as a child in the womb of Devak\u012b, You are also existing outside. You are always in Your abode, but still You can simultaneously expand Yourself into millions of forms. \u201cOne has to understand Your appearance with great intelligence because the material energy is also emanating from You. You are the original source of the material energy, just as the sun is the source of the sunshine. The sunshine cannot cover the sun globe, nor can the material energy \u2014 being an emanation from You \u2014 cover You. You appear to be in the three modes of material energy, but actually the three modes of material energy cannot cover You. This is understood by the highly intellectual philosophers. In other words, although You appear to be within the material energy, You are never covered by it.\u201d We hear from the Vedic version that the Supreme Brahman exhibits His effulgence and therefore everything is illuminated. We can understand from Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 that the brahmajyoti, or the Brahman effulgence, emanates from the body of the Supreme Lord. And from the Brahman effulgence, all creation takes place. It is further stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the Lord is the support of the Brahman effulgence. Originally He is the root cause of everything. But persons who are less intelligent think that when the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes within this material world, He accepts material qualities. Such conclusions are not mature, but are made by the less intelligent."

        "translation": "One who considers his visible body, which is a product of the three modes of nature, to be independent of the soul is unaware of the basis of existence, and therefore he is a rascal. Those who are learned have rejected this conclusion because one can understand through full discussion that with no basis in soul, the visible body and senses would be insubstantial. Nonetheless, although his conclusion has been rejected, a foolish person considers it a reality.",
        "purport": " Without the basic principle of soul, the body cannot be produced. So-called scientists have tried in many ways to produce a living body in their chemical laboratories, but no one has been able to do it because unless the spirit soul is present, a body cannot be prepared from material elements. Since scientists are now enamored of theories about the chemical composition of the body, we have challenged many scientists to make even a small egg. The chemicals in eggs can be found very easily. There is a white substance and a yellow substance, covered by a shell, and modern scientists should very easily be able to duplicate all this. But even if they were to prepare such an egg and put it in an incubator, this man-made chemical egg would not produce a chicken. The soul must be added because there is no question of a chemical combination for life. Those who think that life can exist without the soul have therefore been described here as abudha\u1e25, foolish rascals. Again, there are those who reject the body, regarding it as insubstantial. They are of the same category of fools. One can neither reject the body nor accept it as substantial. The substance is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and both the body and the soul are energies of the Supreme Godhead, as described by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.4-5): \u201cEarth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego \u2014 all together these eight comprise My separated material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.\u201d The body, therefore, has a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the soul does. Since both of them are energies of the Lord, neither of them is false, because they come from the reality. One who does not know this secret of life is described as abudha\u1e25. According to the Vedic injunctions, aitad\u0101tmyam ida\u1e41 sarvam, sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma: everything is the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, both the body and the soul are Brahman, since matter and spirit emanate from Brahman. Not knowing the conclusions of the Vedas, some people accept the material nature as substance, and others accept the spirit soul as substance, but actually Brahman is the substance. Brahman is the cause of all causes. The ingredients and the immediate cause of this manifested material world are Brahman, and we cannot make the ingredients of this world independent of Brahman. Furthermore, since the ingredients and the immediate cause of this material manifestation are Brahman, both of them are truth, satya; there is no validity to the expression brahma satya\u1e41 jagan mithy\u0101. The world is not false. J\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs reject this world, and foolish persons accept this world as reality, and in this way they are both misguided. Although the body is not as important as the soul, we cannot say that it is false. Yet the body is temporary, and only foolish, materialistic persons, who do not have full knowledge of the soul, regard the temporary body as reality and engage in decorating this body. Both of these pitfalls \u2014 rejection of the body as false and acceptance of the body as all in all \u2014 can be avoided when one is fully situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If we regard this world as false, we fall into the category of asuras, who say that this world is unreal, with no foundation and no God in control (asatyam aprati\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e41 te jagad \u0101hur an\u012b\u015bvaram). As described in the Sixteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, this is the conclusion of demons."

Illustrating the logic called bak\u0101ndha-ny\u0101ya, the duck is such a fool that it runs after the testicles of a bull, thinking them to be a hanging fish that can be taken when it drops. Thus the duck is always in darkness. Vy\u0101sadeva, however, the compiler of the Vedic literature, is blackish, but this does not mean that he is in tamo-gu\u1e47a; rather, he is in the highest position of sattva-gu\u1e47a, beyond the material modes of nature. Sometimes these colors (\u015bukla-raktas tath\u0101 p\u012bta\u1e25) are used to designate the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras. Lord K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is celebrated as possessing a blackish color, Lord \u015aiva is whitish, and Lord Brahm\u0101 is reddish, but according to \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b in the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b-\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101, this exhibition of colors is not what is referred to here. The real understanding of \u015bukla, rakta and k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is as follows. The Lord is always transcendental, but for the sake of creation He assumes the color rakta as Lord Brahm\u0101. Again, sometimes the Lord becomes angry. As He says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.19): \u201cThose who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.\u201d To destroy the demons, the Lord becomes angry, and therefore He assumes the form of Lord \u015aiva. In summary, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always beyond the material qualities, and we should not be misled into thinking otherwise simply because of sense perception. One must understand the position of the Lord through the authorities, or mah\u0101janas. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.3.28), ete c\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-kal\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam."

It is said, kali-k\u0101le n\u0101ma-r\u016bpe k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a avat\u0101ra. The Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement is also an incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the form of the holy name (n\u0101ma-r\u016bpe). Every one of us who is actually afraid of the asuric rulers and politicians must welcome this incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Then we will surely be protected from the harassment of asuric rulers. At the present moment these rulers are so powerful that by hook or by crook they capture the highest posts in government and harass countless numbers of people on the plea of national security or some emergency. Then again, one asura defeats another asura, but the public continues to suffer. Therefore the entire world is in a precarious condition, and the only hope is this Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement. Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva appeared when Prahl\u0101da was excessively harassed by his asuric father. Because of such asuric fathers \u2014 that is, the ruling politicians \u2014 it is very difficult to press forward the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement, but because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has now appeared in His holy name through this movement, we can hope that these asuric fathers will be annihilated and the kingdom of God established all over the world. The entire world is now full of many asuras in the guise of politicians, gurus, s\u0101dhus, yog\u012bs and incarnations, and they are misleading the general public away from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which can offer true benefit to human society."

As soon as he hears from his lieutenants that You have appeared, he will immediately come with weapons to kill You.",
        "purport": " Ka\u1e41sa has here been described as asabhya, meaning \u201cuncivilized\u201d or \u201cmost heinous,\u201d because he killed the many children of his sister. When he heard the prophecy that he would be killed by her eighth son, this uncivilized man, Ka\u1e41sa, was immediately ready to kill his innocent sister on the occasion of her marriage. An uncivilized man can do anything for the satisfaction of his senses. He can kill children, he can kill cows, he can kill br\u0101hma\u1e47as, he can kill old men; he has no mercy for anyone. According to the Vedic civilization, cows, women, children, old men and br\u0101hma\u1e47as should be excused if they are at fault. But asuras, uncivilized men, do not care about that. At the present moment, the killing of cows and the killing of children is going on unrestrictedly, and therefore this civilization is not at all human, and those who are conducting this condemned civilization are uncivilized asuras. Such uncivilized men are not in favor of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. As public officers, they declare without hesitation that the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement is a nuisance, although Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 clearly says, satata\u1e41 k\u012brtayanto m\u0101\u1e41 yatanta\u015b ca d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrat\u0101\u1e25. According to this verse, it is the duty of the mah\u0101tm\u0101s to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and try to spread it all over the world to the best of their ability. Unfortunately, society is in such an uncivilized state that there are so-called mah\u0101tm\u0101s who are prepared to kill cows and children and stop the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement. Such uncivilized activities were actually demonstrated in opposition to the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement\u2019s Bombay center, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Land. As Ka\u1e41sa was not expected to kill the beautiful child of Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, the uncivilized society, although unhappy about the advancement of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, cannot be expected to stop it. Yet we must face many difficulties in many different ways. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be killed, Vasudeva, as the father of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was trembling because in affection he thought that Ka\u1e41sa would immediately come and kill his son. Similarly, although the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are not different and no asuras can check it, we are afraid that at any moment the asuras can stop this movement in any part of the world."

        "translation": "\u015ar\u012b Devak\u012b said: My dear Lord, there are different Vedas, some of which describe You as unperceivable through words and the mind. Yet You are the origin of the entire cosmic manifestation. You are Brahman, the greatest of everything, full of effulgence like the sun. You have no material cause, You are free from change and deviation, and You have no material desires. Thus the Vedas say that You are the substance. Therefore, my Lord, You are directly the origin of all Vedic statements, and by understanding You, one gradually understands everything. You are different from the light of Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101, yet You are not different from them. Everything emanates from You. Indeed, You are the cause of all causes, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the light of all transcendental knowledge.",
        "purport": " Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the origin of everything, and there is no difference between Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because both of Them are vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva. From the \u1e5ag Veda we understand, o\u1e41 tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 padam: the original substance is the all-pervading Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is also Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the effulgent Brahman. The living entities are also part and parcel of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who has various energies (par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate sv\u0101bh\u0101vik\u012b j\u00f1\u0101na-bala-kriy\u0101 ca). Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is therefore everything. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8), aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhavo matta\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 pravartate: \u201cI am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, therefore, is the original cause of everything (sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am). When Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expands in His all-pervading aspect, we should understand Him to be the nir\u0101k\u0101ra-nirvi\u015be\u1e63a-brahmajyoti. Although everything emanates from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He is ultimately a person. Aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m: He is the origin of Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Mahe\u015bvara, and from them many other demigods are manifested. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.27), brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham; \u201cBrahman rests upon Me.\u201d The Lord also says: \u201cWhatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunt\u012b, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding.\u201d (Bg. 9.23) There are many persons who worship different demigods, considering all of them to be separate gods, which in fact they are not. The fact is that every demigod, and every living entity, is part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25). The demigods are also in the category of living entities; they are not separate gods. But men whose knowledge is immature and contaminated by the modes of material nature worship various demigods, according to their intelligence. Therefore they are rebuked in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante\u00a0\u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25). Because they are unintelligent and not very advanced and have not properly considered the truth, they take to the worship of various demigods or speculate according to various philosophies, such as the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is the actual origin of everything. As stated in the Vedas, yasya bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 sarvam ida\u1e41 vibh\u0101ti. The Absolute Truth is described later in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.28.15) as satya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam anantam yad brahma-jyoti\u1e25 san\u0101tanam. The brahmajyoti is san\u0101tana, eternal, yet it is dependent on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham). The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 states that the Lord is all-pervading. A\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham: He is within this universe, and He is within the atom as Param\u0101tm\u0101. Yasya prabh\u0101 prabhavato jagad-a\u1e47\u1e0da-ko\u1e6di-ko\u1e6di\u1e63v a\u015be\u1e63a-vasudh\u0101di-vibhu-ti-bhinnam: Brahman is also not independent of Him. Therefore whatever a philosopher may describe is ultimately K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma, para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n). According to different phases of understanding, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is differently described, but in fact He is the origin of everything. Because Devak\u012b was an unalloyed devotee, she could understand that the same Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u had appeared as her son. Therefore, after the prayers of Vasudeva, Devak\u012b offered her prayers. She was very frightened because of her brother\u2019s atrocities. Devak\u012b said, \u201cMy dear Lord, Your eternal forms, like N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Lord R\u0101ma, \u015ae\u1e63a, Var\u0101ha, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, V\u0101mana, Baladeva, and millions of similar incarnations emanating from Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, are described in the Vedic literature as original. You are original because all Your forms as incarnations are outside of this material creation. Your form was existing before this cosmic manifestation was created. Your forms are eternal and all-pervading. They are self-effulgent, changeless and uncontaminated by the material qualities. Such eternal forms are ever-cognizant and full of bliss; they are situated in transcendental goodness and are always engaged in different pastimes. You are not limited to a particular form only; all such transcendental, eternal forms are self-sufficient. I can understand that You are the Supreme Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\u201d We may conclude, therefore, that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is everything, although He is also different from everything. This is the acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva philosophy."

I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, under whose control even the sun, which is considered to be the eye of the Lord, rotates within the fixed orbit of eternal time.\u201d Although we see the cosmic manifestation as gigantic and wonderful, it is within the limitations of k\u0101la, the time factor.

Every minute, every second, every day, every night, every month and every year of time can be calculated according to the sun\u2019s movements. But the sun is not independent, for it is under time\u2019s control. Bhramati sa\u1e41bh\u1e5bta-k\u0101la-cakra\u1e25: the sun moves within the k\u0101la-cakra, the orbit of time. The sun is under the control of time, and time is controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord has no fear of time. The Lord is addressed here as avyakta-bandhu, or the inaugurator of the movements of the entire cosmic manifestation. Sometimes the cosmic manifestation is compared to a potter\u2019s wheel. When a potter\u2019s wheel is spinning, who has set it in motion? It is the potter, of course, although sometimes we can see only the motion of the wheel and cannot see the potter himself. Therefore the Lord, who is behind the motion of the cosmos, is called avyakta-bandhu. Everything is within the limits of time, but time moves under the direction of the Lord, who is therefore not within time\u2019s limit."

        "translation": "No one in this material world has become free from the four principles birth, death, old age and disease, even by fleeing to various planets. But now that You have appeared, My Lord, death is fleeing in fear of You, and the living entities, having obtained shelter at Your lotus feet by Your mercy, are sleeping in full mental peace.",
        "purport": " There are different categories of living entities, but everyone is afraid of death. The highest aim of the karm\u012bs is to be promoted to the higher, heavenly planets, where the duration of life is very long. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.17), sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahma\u1e47o vidu\u1e25: one day of Brahm\u0101 equals 1,000 yugas, and each yuga consists of 4,300,000 years. Similarly, Brahm\u0101 has a night of 1,000 times 4,300,000 years. In this way, we may calculate Brahm\u0101\u2019s month and year, but even Brahm\u0101, who lives for millions and millions of years (dvi-par\u0101rdha-k\u0101la), also must die. According to Vedic \u015b\u0101stra, the inhabitants of the higher planetary systems live for 10,000 years, and just as Brahm\u0101\u2019s day is calculated to equal 4,300,000,000 of our years, one day in the higher planetary systems equals six of our months. Karm\u012bs, therefore, try for promotion to the higher planetary systems, but this cannot free them from death. In this material world, everyone from Brahm\u0101 to the insignificant ant must die. Therefore this world is called martya-loka. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.16), \u0101brahma-bhuvan\u0101l lok\u0101\u1e25 punar \u0101vartino \u2019rjuna: as long as one is within this material world, either on Brahmaloka or on any other loka within this universe, one must undergo the k\u0101la-cakra of one life after another (bh\u016btv\u0101 bh\u016btv\u0101 pral\u012byate). But if one returns to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante), one need not reenter the limits of time. Therefore, devotees who have taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord can sleep very peacefully with this assurance from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9), tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti: after giving up the present body, a devotee who has understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is need not return to this material world. The constitutional position for the living entity is eternity (na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre, nitya\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvato\u00a0\u2019yam). Every living entity is eternal. But because of having fallen into this material world, one wanders within the universe, continually changing from one body to another. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says: Everyone is wandering up and down within this universe, but one who is sufficiently fortunate comes in contact with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, by the mercy of the spiritual master, and takes to the path of devotional service. Then one is assured of eternal life, with no fear of death. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears, everyone is freed from fear of death, yet Devak\u012b felt, \u201cWe are still afraid of Ka\u1e41sa, although You have appeared as our son.\u201d She was more or less bewildered as to why this should be so, and she appealed to the Lord to free her and Vasudeva from this fear. In this connection, it may be noted that the moon is one of the heavenly planets. From the Vedic literature we understand that one who goes to the moon receives a life with a duration of ten thousand years in which to enjoy the fruits of pious activities. If our so-called scientists are going to the moon, why should they come back here? We must conclude without a doubt that they have never gone to the moon. To go to the moon, one must have the qualification of pious activities. Then one may go there and live. If one has gone to the moon, why should he return to this planet, where life is of a very short duration?"

        "purport": " The word dhy\u0101na-dhi\u1e63\u1e47yam is significant in this verse because the form of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is meditated upon by yog\u012bs (dhy\u0101n\u0101vasthita-tad-gatena manas\u0101 pa\u015byanti ya\u1e41 yogina\u1e25). Devak\u012b requested the Lord, who had appeared as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, to conceal that form, for she wanted to see the Lord as an ordinary child, like a child appreciated by persons who have material eyes. Devak\u012b wanted to see whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead had factually appeared or she was dreaming the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form. If Ka\u1e41sa were to come, she thought, upon seeing the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form he would immediately kill the child, but if he saw a human child, he might reconsider. Devak\u012b was afraid of Ugrasena-\u0101tmaja; that is, she was afraid not of Ugrasena and his men, but of the son of Ugrasena. Thus she requested the Lord to dissipate that fear, since He is always ready to give protection (abhayam) to His devotees. \u201cMy Lord,\u201d she prayed, \u201cI request You to save me from the cruel hands of the son of Ugrasena, Ka\u1e41sa. I am praying to Your Lordship to please rescue me from this fearful condition because You are always ready to give protection to Your servitors.\u201d The Lord has confirmed this statement in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by assuring Arjuna, \u201cYou may declare to the world, My devotee shall never be vanquished.\u201d While thus praying to the Lord for rescue, mother Devak\u012b expressed her motherly affection: \u201cI understand that this transcendental form is generally perceived in meditation by the great sages, but I am still afraid because as soon as Ka\u1e41sa understands that You have appeared, he might harm You. So I request that for the time being You become invisible to our material eyes.\u201d In other words, she requested the Lord to assume the form of an ordinary child. \u201cMy only cause of fear from my brother Ka\u1e41sa is due to Your appearance. My Lord Madhus\u016bdana, Ka\u1e41sa may know that You are already born. Therefore I request You to conceal this four-armed form of Your Lordship, which holds the four symbols of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2014 namely the conchshell, the disc, the club and the lotus flower. My dear Lord, at the end of the annihilation of the cosmic manifestation, You put the whole universe within Your abdomen; still, by Your unalloyed mercy, You have appeared in my womb. I am surprised that You imitate the activities of ordinary human beings just to please Your devotee.\u201d Devak\u012b was so afraid of Ka\u1e41sa that she could not believe that Ka\u1e41sa would be unable to kill Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who was personally present. Out of motherly affection, therefore, she requested the Supreme Personality of Godhead to disappear. Although because of the Lord\u2019s disappearance Ka\u1e41sa would harass her more and more, thinking that the child born of her was hidden somewhere, she did not want the transcendental child to be harassed and killed. Therefore she requested Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to disappear. Later, when harassed, she would think of Him within her mind."

        "translation": "At the time of devastation, the entire cosmos, containing all created moving and nonmoving entities, enters Your transcendental body and is held there without difficulty. But now this transcendental form has taken birth from my womb. People will not be able to believe this, and I shall become an object of ridicule.",
        "purport": " As explained in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, loving service to the Personality of Godhead is of two different kinds: ai\u015bvarya-p\u016br\u1e47a, full of opulence, and ai\u015bvarya-\u015b\u012bthila, without opulence. Real love of Godhead begins with ai\u015bvarya-\u015b\u012bthila, simply on the basis of pure love. Pure devotees, whose eyes are anointed with the ointment of prema, love, want to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as \u015ay\u0101masundara, Mural\u012bdhara, with a flute swaying in His two hands. This is the form available to the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, who are all in love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as \u015ay\u0101masundara, not as Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, who is worshiped in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, where the devotees admire His opulence. Although Devak\u012b is not on the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana platform, she is near the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana platform. On the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana platform the mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and on the Mathur\u0101 and Dv\u0101rak\u0101 platform the mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Devak\u012b. In Mathur\u0101 and Dv\u0101rak\u0101 the love for the Lord is mixed with appreciation of His opulence, but in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not exhibited. There are five stages of loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 \u015b\u0101nta, d\u0101sya, sakhya, v\u0101tsalya and m\u0101dhurya. Devak\u012b is on the platform of v\u0101tsalya. She wanted to deal with her eternal son, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in that stage of love, and therefore she wanted the Supreme Personality of Godhead to withdraw His opulent form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura illuminates this fact very clearly in his explanation of this verse. Bhakti, bhagav\u0101n and bhakta do not belong to the material world. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who engages in the spiritual activities of unalloyed devotional service immediately transcends the modes of material nature and is elevated to the spiritual platform.\u201d From the very beginning of one\u2019s transactions in bhakti, one is situated on the transcendental platform. Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, therefore, being situated in a completely pure devotional state, are beyond this material world and are not subject to material fear. In the transcendental world, however, because of pure devotion, there is a similar conception of fear, which is due to intense love. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25) and as confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (bhakty\u0101ham ekay\u0101 gr\u0101hya\u1e25), without bhakti one cannot understand the spiritual situation of the Lord. Bhakti may be considered in three stages, called gu\u1e47\u012b-bh\u016bta, pradh\u0101n\u012b-bh\u016bta and kevala, and according to these stages there are three divisions, which are called j\u00f1\u0101na, j\u00f1\u0101namay\u012b and rati, or prem\u0101 \u2014 that is, simple knowledge, love mixed with knowledge, and pure love. By simple knowledge, one can perceive transcendental bliss without variety. This perception is called m\u0101na-bh\u016bti. When one comes to the stage of j\u00f1\u0101namay\u012b, one realizes the transcendental opulences of the Personality of Godhead. But when one reaches pure love, one realizes the transcendental form of the Lord as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Lord R\u0101ma. This is what is wanted. Especially in the m\u0101dhurya-rasa, one becomes attached to the Personality of Godhead (\u015br\u012b-vigraha-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha-r\u016bp\u0101di). Then loving transactions between the Lord and the devotee begin. The special significance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s bearing a flute in His hands in Vrajabh\u016bmi, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, is described as m\u0101dhur\u012b \u2026 vir\u0101jate. The form of the Lord with a flute in His hands is most attractive, and the one who is most sublimely attracted is \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, R\u0101dhik\u0101. She enjoys supremely blissful association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sometimes people cannot understand why R\u0101dhik\u0101\u2019s name is not mentioned in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Actually, however, R\u0101dhik\u0101 can be understood from the word \u0101r\u0101dhana, which indicates that She enjoys the highest loving affairs with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Not wanting to be ridiculed for having given birth to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Devak\u012b wanted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, with two hands, and therefore she requested the Lord to change His form."

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is eternal, and His selection of a father and mother from among His devotees takes place eternally.

One who follows his imaginations about the Supreme Personality of Godhead is condemned. The Lord appears as the son of His devotee by His para\u1e41 bh\u0101vam. The word bh\u0101va refers to the stage of pure love, which has nothing to do with material transactions."

        "translation": "When both of you were ordered by Lord Brahm\u0101 to create progeny, you first underwent severe austerities by controlling your senses.",
        "purport": " Here is an instruction about how to use one\u2019s senses to create progeny. According to Vedic principles, before creating progeny one must fully control the senses. This control takes place through the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. In India there is great agitation for birth control in various mechanical ways, but birth cannot be mechanically controlled. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.9), janma-m\u1e5btyu-jar\u0101-vy\u0101dhi-du\u1e25kha-do\u1e63\u0101nudar\u015banam: birth, death, old age and disease are certainly the primary distresses of the material world. People are trying to control birth, but they are not able to control death; and if one cannot control death, one cannot control birth either. In other words, artificially controlling birth is not any more feasible than artificially controlling death. According to Vedic civilization, procreation should not be contrary to religious principles, and then the birthrate will be controlled. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.11), dharm\u0101viruddho bh\u016bte\u1e63u k\u0101mo \u2019smi: sex not contrary to religious principles is a representation of the Supreme Lord. People should be educated in how to give birth to good children through sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras, beginning with the garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra; birth should not be controlled by artificial means, for this will lead to a civilization of animals. If one follows religious principles, he automatically practices birth control because if one is spiritually educated he knows that the after-effects of sex are various types of misery (bahu-du\u1e25kha-bh\u0101ja). One who is spiritually advanced does not indulge in uncontrolled sex. Therefore, instead of being forced to refrain from sex or refrain from giving birth to many children, people should be spiritually educated, and then birth control will automatically follow. If one is determined to make spiritual advancement, he will not beget a child unless able to make that child a devotee. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.18), pit\u0101 na sa sy\u0101t: one should not become a father unless one is able to protect his child from m\u1e5btyu, the path of birth and death. But where is there education about this? A responsible father never begets children like cats and dogs. Instead of being encouraged to adopt artificial means of birth control, people should be educated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because only then will they understand their responsibility to their children. If one can beget children who will be devotees and be taught to turn aside from the path of birth and death (m\u1e5btyu-sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-vartmani), there is no need of birth control. Rather, one should be encouraged to beget children. Artificial means of birth control have no value. Whether one begets children or does not, a population of men who are like cats and dogs will never make human society happy. It is therefore necessary for people to be educated spiritually so that instead of begetting children like cats and dogs, they will undergo austerities to produce devotees. This will make their lives successful."

        "purport": " Vasudeva and Devak\u012b did not obtain the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son very easily, nor does the Supreme Godhead accept merely anyone as His father and mother. Here we can see how Vasudeva and Devak\u012b obtained K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as their eternal son. In our own lives, we are meant to follow the principles indicated herewith for getting good children. Of course, it is not possible for everyone to get K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his son, but at least one can get very good sons and daughters for the benefit of human society. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that if human beings do not follow the spiritual way of life, there will be an increase of var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara population, population begotten like cats and dogs, and the entire world will become like hell. Not practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness but simply encouraging artificial means to check the population will be futile; the population will increase, and it will consist of var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara, unwanted progeny. It is better to teach people how to beget children not like hogs and dogs, but in controlled life. Human life is meant not for becoming a hog or dog, but for tapo divyam, transcendental austerity. Everyone should be taught to undergo austerity, tapasya. Although it may not be possible to undergo tapasya like that of P\u1e5b\u015bni and Sutap\u0101, the \u015b\u0101stra has given an opportunity for a method of tapasya very easy to perform \u2014 the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement. One cannot expect to undergo tapasya to get K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as one\u2019s child, yet simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra (k\u012brtan\u0101d eva k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47asya), one can become so pure that one becomes free from all the contamination of this material world (mukta-sa\u1e45ga\u1e25) and goes back home, back to Godhead (para\u1e41 vrajet). The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, therefore, is teaching people not to adopt artificial means of happiness, but to take the real path of happiness as prescribed in the \u015b\u0101stra \u2014 the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra \u2014 and become perfect in every aspect of material existence."

Since I am the best of all bestowers of benediction, I appeared in this same form as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to ask you to take from Me the benediction you desired. You then expressed your desire to have a son exactly like Me.",
        "purport": " Twelve thousand years on the celestial planets is not a very long time for those who live in the upper planetary system, although it may be very long for those who live on this planet. Sutap\u0101 was the son of Brahm\u0101, and as we have already understood from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.17), one day of Brahm\u0101 equals many millions of years according to our calculation (sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahma\u1e47o vidu\u1e25). We should be careful to understand that to get K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as one\u2019s son, one must undergo such great austerities. If we want to get the Supreme Personality of Godhead to become one of us in this material world, this requires great penance, but if we want to go back to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so\u00a0\u2019rjuna), we need only understand Him and love Him. Through love only, we can very easily go back home, back to Godhead. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore declared, prem\u0101 pum-artho mah\u0101n: love of Godhead is the highest achievement for anyone. As we have explained, in worship of the Lord there are three stages \u2014 j\u00f1\u0101na, j\u00f1\u0101namay\u012b and rati, or love. Sutap\u0101 and his wife, P\u1e5b\u015bni, inaugurated their devotional activities on the basis of full knowledge. Gradually they developed love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when this love was mature, the Lord appeared as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, although Devak\u012b then requested Him to assume the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To love the Supreme Personality of Godhead more, we want a form of the Lord like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or R\u0101ma. We can engage in loving transactions with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a especially. In this age, we are all fallen, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared as Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu to bestow upon us love of Godhead directly. This was appreciated by the associates of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b said: In this verse, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is described as mah\u0101-vad\u0101nya, the most munificent of charitable persons, because He gives K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so easily that one can attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. We should therefore take advantage of the benediction given by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, and when by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra we are cleansed of all dirty things (ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam), we shall be able to understand very easily that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only object of love (k\u012brtan\u0101d eva k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47asya mukta-sa\u1e45ga\u1e25 para\u1e41 vrajet). Therefore, one need not undergo severe penances for many thousands of years; one need only learn how to love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be always engaged in His service (sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau svayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25). Then one can very easily go back home, back to Godhead. Instead of bringing the Lord here for some material purpose, to have a son or whatever else, if we go back home, back to Godhead, our real relationship with the Lord is revealed, and we eternally engage in our eternal relationship. By chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, we gradually develop our eternal relationship with the Supreme Person and thus attain the perfection called svar\u016bpa-siddhi. We should take advantage of this benediction and go back home, back to Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has therefore sung, patita-p\u0101vana-hetu tava avat\u0101ra: Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu appeared as an incarnation to deliver all fallen souls like us and directly bestow upon us love of Godhead. We must take advantage of this great benediction of the great Personality of Godhead."

This attachment came about by the influence of devam\u0101y\u0101. Loving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as one\u2019s son is a Vedic principle. Vasudeva and Devak\u012b never desired anything but to have the Lord as their son, yet for this purpose they apparently wanted to live like ordinary g\u1e5bhasthas for sexual indulgence. Although this was a transaction of spiritual potency, their desire appears like attachment for sex in conjugal life. If one wants to return home, back to Godhead, one must give up such desires. This is possible only when one develops intense love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has said: If one wants to go back home, back to Godhead, one must be ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana, free from all material desires. Therefore, instead of desiring to have the Lord come here and become one\u2019s son, one should desire to become free from all material desires (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam) and go back home, back to Godhead. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu teaches us in His \u015aik\u1e63\u0101\u1e63\u1e6daka: \u201cO almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor do I desire beautiful women, nor do I want any number of followers.

If one has a tinge of attachment for the material enjoyments of eating, sleeping, mating and defending, one is not ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana. But one really should be ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana. Therefore, one should be free from the desire to beget a child like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by sexual enjoyment. This is indirectly hinted at in this verse."

On the other hand, the Supreme Lord was also anxious, thinking that if He appeared as an ordinary child, she would not believe that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u had appeared. Such are the dealings between devotees and the Lord. The Lord deals with His devotees exactly like a human being, but this does not mean that the Lord is one of the human beings, for this is the conclusion of nondevotees (avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam).

        "purport": " This instruction by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His father and mother, who are eternally connected with Him, is especially intended for persons eager to return home, back to Godhead. One should never think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as an ordinary human being, as nondevotees do. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, personally appeared and left His instructions for the benefit of all human society, but fools and rascals unfortunately think of Him as an ordinary human being and twist the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 for the satisfaction of their senses. Practically everyone commenting on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 interprets it for sense gratification. It has become especially fashionable for modern scholars and politicians to interpret Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as if it were something fictitious, and by their wrong interpretations they are spoiling their own careers and the careers of others. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, however, is fighting against this principle of regarding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a fictitious person and of accepting that there was no Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, that everything is symbolic, and that nothing in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is true. In any case, if one truly wants to be successful, one can do so by reading the text of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu especially stressed the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: y\u0101re dekha, t\u0101re kaha\u00a0\u2018k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019-upade\u015ba. If one wants to achieve the highest success in life, one must accept Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as spoken by the Supreme Lord. By accepting Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in this way, all of human society can become perfect and happy. It is to be noted that because Vasudeva and Devak\u012b would be separated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when He was carried to Gokula, the residence of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the Lord personally instructed them that they should always think of Him as their son and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That would keep them in touch with Him. After eleven years, the Lord would return to Mathur\u0101 to be their son, and therefore there was no question of separation."

In their presence, by His internal energy, He then transformed Himself into a small human child. [In other words, He transformed Himself into His original form: k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam.]",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.6), sambhav\u0101my \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101: whatever is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is done by His spiritual energy; nothing is forced upon Him by the material energy. This is the difference between the Lord and an ordinary living being. The Vedas say: It is natural for the Lord to be untinged by material qualities, and because everything is perfectly present in His spiritual energy, as soon as He desires something, it is immediately done. The Lord is not a pr\u0101k\u1e5bta-\u015bi\u015bu, a child of this world, but by His personal energy He appeared like one. Ordinary people may have difficulty accepting the supreme controller, God, as a human being because they forget that He can do everything by spiritual energy (\u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101). Nonbelievers say, \u201cHow can the supreme controller descend as an ordinary being?\u201d This sort of thinking is materialistic. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that unless we accept the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as inconceivable, beyond the conception of our words and mind, we cannot understand the Supreme Lord. Those who doubt that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can come as a human being and turn Himself into a human child are fools who think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is material, that He is born and that He therefore also dies. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Third Canto, Fourth Chapter, verses 28 and 29, there is a description of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s leaving His body. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it inquired from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u201cWhen all the members of the Yadu dynasty met their end, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also put an end to Himself, and the only member of the family who remained alive was Uddhava. How was this possible?\u201d \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b answered that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by His own energy, destroyed the entire family and then thought of making His own body disappear. In this connection, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b described how the Lord gave up His body. But this was not the destruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body; rather, it was the disappearance of the Supreme Lord by His personal energy. Actually, the Lord does not give up His body, which is eternal, but as He can change His body from the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to that of an ordinary human child, He can change His body to any form He likes. This does not mean that He gives up His body. By spiritual energy, the Lord can appear in a body made of wood or stone. He can change His body into anything because everything is His energy (par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate). As clearly said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.4), bhinn\u0101 prak\u1e5btir a\u1e63\u1e6dadh\u0101: the material elements are separated energies of the Supreme Lord. If He transforms Himself into the arc\u0101-m\u016brti, the worshipable Deity, which we see as stone or wood, He is still K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore the \u015b\u0101stra warns, arcye vi\u1e63\u1e47au \u015bil\u0101-dh\u012br guru\u1e63u nara-mati\u1e25. One who thinks that the worshipable Deity in the temple is made of wood or stone, one who sees a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava guru as an ordinary human being, or one who materially conceives of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava as belonging to a particular caste is n\u0101rak\u012b, a resident of hell. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can appear before us in many forms, as He likes, but we must know the true facts: janma karma ca me divyam eva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25 (Bg. 4.9). By following the instructions of s\u0101dhu, guru and \u015b\u0101stra \u2014 the saintly persons, the spiritual master and the authoritative scriptures \u2014 one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and then one makes his life successful by returning home, back to Godhead."

Although their names were different, they were practically nondifferent personalities. The only difference is that Devak\u012b was able to understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had been born to her and had now changed into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas Ya\u015bod\u0101 was not able to understand what kind of child had been born to her. Ya\u015bod\u0101 was such an advanced devotee that she never regarded K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but simply loved Him as her own child. Devak\u012b, however, knew from the very beginning that although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was her son, He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, no one regarded K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When something very wonderful happened because of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities, the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana \u2014 the cowherd men, the cowherd boys, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Ya\u015bod\u0101 and the others \u2014 were surprised, but they never considered their son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes they suggested that some great demigod had appeared there as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In such an exalted status of devotional service, a devotee forgets the position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and intensely loves the Supreme Personality of Godhead without understanding His position. This is called kevala-bhakti and is distinct from the stages of j\u00f1\u0101na and j\u00f1\u0101namay\u012b bhakti."
