Therefore, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s absence, Brahm\u0101 took all the boys and calves to another place.

Thus he became entangled in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s m\u0101y\u0101. After all, Brahm\u0101 was born materially. As mentioned here, ambhojanma jani\u1e25: he was born of ambhoja, a lotus flower. It does not matter that he was born of a lotus and not of any man, animal or material father. A lotus is also material, and anyone born through the material energy must be subject to the four material deficiencies: bhrama (the tendency to commit mistakes), pram\u0101da (the tendency to be illusioned), vipralips\u0101 (the tendency to cheat) and kara\u1e47\u0101p\u0101\u1e6dava (imperfect senses). Thus Brahm\u0101 also became entangled. Brahm\u0101, with his m\u0101y\u0101, wanted to test whether K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was actually present. These cowherd boys were but expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal self (\u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibh\u0101vit\u0101bhi\u1e25). Later K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would show Brahm\u0101 how He expands Himself into everything as His personal pleasure, \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa. Hl\u0101din\u012b \u015baktir asm\u0101t: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has a transcendental potency called hl\u0101din\u012b \u015bakti. He does not enjoy anything that is a product of the material energy. Brahm\u0101, therefore, would see Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expand His energy. Brahm\u0101 wanted to take away K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s associates, but instead he took away some other boys and calves. R\u0101va\u1e47a wanted to take away S\u012bt\u0101, but that was impossible, and instead he took away a m\u0101y\u0101 S\u012bt\u0101. Similarly, Brahm\u0101 took away m\u0101y\u0101rbhak\u0101\u1e25: boys manifested by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s m\u0101y\u0101. Brahm\u0101 could show some extraordinary opulence to the m\u0101y\u0101rbhak\u0101\u1e25; but he could not show any extraordinary potency to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s associates. That he would see in the very near future. M\u0101y\u0101rbhakasya \u012b\u015bitu\u1e25. This bewilderment, this m\u0101y\u0101, was caused by the supreme controller, prabhavata\u1e25 \u2014 the all-potent Supreme Person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 and we shall see the result. Anyone materially born is subject to bewilderment. This pastime is therefore called brahma-vimohana-l\u012bl\u0101, the pastime of bewildering Brahm\u0101. Mohita\u1e41 n\u0101bhij\u0101n\u0101ti m\u0101m ebhya\u1e25 param avyayam (Bg. 7.13). Materially born persons cannot fully understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even the demigods cannot understand Him (muhyanti yat s\u016braya\u1e25). Tene brahm\u0101 h\u1e5bd\u0101 ya \u0101di-kavaye (Bh\u0101g. 1.1.1). Everyone, from Brahm\u0101 down to the small insect, must take lessons from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

Now that the original group had been taken away by Brahm\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself assumed the forms of every member of the group, without anyone\u2019s knowledge, even the knowledge of Baladeva, and continued the usual program. He was ordering His friends to do this and that, and He was controlling the calves and going into the forest to search for them when they went astray, allured by new grass, but these calves and boys were He Himself. This was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s inconceivable potency.

The same pleasure potency (\u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa) was expanded by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when He Himself became all the calves and boys and enjoyed transcendental bliss in Vrajabh\u016bmi. This was done by the Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 potency and was inconceivable to persons under the potency of Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101."

They observe distinctions, however, between those other sons and their own. But now the elderly gop\u012bs could not distinguish between their own sons and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for since their own sons had been taken by Brahm\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had expanded as their sons. Therefore, their extra affection for their sons, who were now K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, was due to bewilderment resembling that of Brahm\u0101. Previously, the mothers of \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101, Sud\u0101m\u0101, Subala and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s other friends did not have the same affection for one another\u2019s sons, but now the gop\u012bs treated all the boys as their own. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, therefore, wanted to explain this increment of affection in terms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s bewilderment of Brahm\u0101, the gop\u012bs, the cows and everyone else."

The mothers were actually more anxious to feed the older calves, although the new calves were present, because the older calves were expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These surprising events were taking place by the manipulation of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101.

Now I can see that You alone are manifesting Yourself in all varieties of difference. Although one, You are existing in the different forms of the calves and boys. Please briefly explain this to Me.\u201d Having thus been requested by Lord Baladeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explained the whole situation, and Baladeva understood it.",
        "purport": " Inquiring from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a about the actual situation, Lord Balar\u0101ma said, \u201cMy dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the beginning I thought that all these cows, calves and cowherd boys were either great sages and saintly persons or demigods, but at the present it appears that they are actually Your expansions. They are all You; You Yourself are playing as the calves and cows and boys. What is the mystery of this situation? Where have those other calves and cows and boys gone? And why are You expanding Yourself as the cows, calves and boys? Will You kindly tell Me what is the cause?\u201d At the request of Balar\u0101ma, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a briefly explained the whole situation: how the calves and boys were stolen by Brahm\u0101 and how He was concealing the incident by expanding Himself so that people would not know that the original cows, calves and boys were missing. Balar\u0101ma understood, therefore, that this was not m\u0101y\u0101 but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s opulence. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has all opulences, and this was but another opulence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u201cAt first,\u201d Lord Balar\u0101ma said, \u201cI thought that these boys and calves were a display of the power of great sages like N\u0101rada, but now I see that all these boys and calves are You.\u201d After inquiring from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord Balar\u0101ma understood that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself had become many. That the Lord can do this is stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.33). Advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam: although He is one, He can expand Himself in so many forms. According to the Vedic version, eka\u1e41 bahu sy\u0101m: He can expand Himself into many thousands and millions but still remain one. In that sense, everything is spiritual because everything is an expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that is, everything is an expansion either of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself or of His potency. Because the potency is nondifferent from the potent, the potency and the potent are one (\u015bakti-\u015baktimatayor abheda\u1e25). The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, however, say, cid-acit-samanvaya\u1e25: spirit and matter are one. This is a wrong conception. Spirit (cit) is different from matter (acit), as explained by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.4-5): \u201cEarth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego \u2014 all together these eight comprise My separated material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.\u201d Spirit and matter cannot be made one, for actually they are superior and inferior energies, yet the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, or Advaita-v\u0101d\u012bs, try to make them one. This is wrong. Although spirit and matter ultimately come from the same one source, they cannot be made one. For example, there are many things that come from our bodies, but although they come from the same source, they cannot be made one. We should be careful to note that although the supreme source is one, the emanations from this source should be separately regarded as inferior and superior. The difference between the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da and Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophies is that the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy recognizes this fact. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s philosophy, therefore, is called acintya-bhed\u0101bheda \u2014 simultaneous oneness and difference. For example, fire and heat cannot be separated, for where there is fire there is heat and where there is heat there is fire. Nonetheless, although we cannot touch fire, heat we can tolerate. Therefore, although they are one, they are different."

        "purport": " Lord Brahm\u0101 had gone away for only a moment of his time, but when he returned, a year of human time had passed. On different planets, the calculation of time is different. To give an example, a man-made satellite may orbit the earth in an hour and twenty-five minutes and thus complete one full day, although a day ordinarily takes twenty-four hours for those living on earth. Therefore, what was but a moment for Brahm\u0101 was one year on earth. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a continued to expand Himself in so many forms for one year, but by the arrangement of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 no one could understand this but Balar\u0101ma. After one moment of Brahm\u0101\u2019s calculation, Brahm\u0101 came back to see the fun caused by his stealing the boys and calves. But he was also afraid that he was playing with fire. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was his master, and he had played mischief for fun by taking away K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s calves and boys. He was really anxious, so he did not stay away very long; he came back after a moment (of his calculation). When Brahm\u0101 returned, he saw that all the boys, calves and cows were playing with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the same way as when he had come upon them; by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s display of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, the same pastimes were going on without any change. On the day when Lord Brahm\u0101 had first come, Baladeva could not go with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the cowherd boys, for it was His birthday, and His mother had kept Him back for the proper ceremonial bath, called \u015b\u0101ntika-sn\u0101na. Therefore Lord Baladeva was not taken by Brahm\u0101 at that time. Now, one year later, Brahm\u0101 returned, and because he returned on exactly the same day, Baladeva was again kept at home for His birthday. Therefore, although this verse mentions that Brahm\u0101 saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and all the cowherd boys, Baladeva is not mentioned. It was five or six days earlier that Baladeva had inquired from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a about the extraordinary affection of the cows and cowherd men, but now, when Brahm\u0101 returned, Brahm\u0101 saw all the calves and cowherd boys playing with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but he did not see Baladeva. As in the previous year, Lord Baladeva did not go to the woods on the day Lord Brahm\u0101 appeared there."

        "purport": " Brahm\u0101 wanted to bewilder K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who bewilders the entire universe. The whole universe is under K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mystic power (mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101), but Brahm\u0101 wanted to mystify Him. The result was that Brahm\u0101 himself was mystified, just as one who wants to kill another may himself be killed. In other words, Brahm\u0101 was defeated by his own attempt. In a similar position are the scientists and philosophers who want to overcome the mystic power of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They challenge K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, saying, \u201cWhat is God? We can do this, and we can do that.\u201d But the more they challenge K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this way, the more they are implicated in suffering. The lesson here is that we should not try to overcome K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Rather, instead of endeavoring to surpass Him, we should surrender to Him (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). Instead of defeating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Brahm\u0101 himself was defeated, for he could not understand what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was doing. Since Brahm\u0101, the chief person within this universe, was so bewildered, what is to be said of so-called scientists and philosophers? Sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. We should give up all our tiny efforts to defy the arrangement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Instead, whatever arrangements He proposes, we should accept. This is always better, for this will make us happy. The more we try to defeat the arrangement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the more we become implicated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s m\u0101y\u0101 (daiv\u012b hy e\u1e63\u0101 gu\u1e47a-may\u012b mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101). But one who has reached the point of surrendering to the instructions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante) is liberated, free from k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-m\u0101y\u0101 (m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te). The power of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just like a government that cannot be overcome. First of all there are laws, and then there is police power, and beyond that is military power. Therefore, what is the use of trying to overcome the power of the government? Similarly, what is the use of trying to challenge K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? From the next verse it is clear that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be defeated by any kind of mystic power. If one gets even a little power of scientific knowledge, one tries to defy God, but actually no one is able to bewilder K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When Brahm\u0101, the chief person within the universe, tried to bewilder K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he himself was bewildered and astonished. This is the position of the conditioned soul. Brahm\u0101 wanted to mystify K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but he himself was mystified. The word vi\u1e63\u1e47um is significant in this verse. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u pervades the entire material world, whereas Brahm\u0101 merely occupies one subordinate post. The word n\u0101th\u0101\u1e25, which refers to Lord Brahm\u0101, is plural because there are innumerable universes and innumerable Brahm\u0101s. Brahm\u0101 is but a tiny force. This was exhibited in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a called for Brahm\u0101. One day when Brahm\u0101 came to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at Dv\u0101rak\u0101, the doorman, at Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s request, asked, \u201cWhich Brahm\u0101 are you?\u201d Later, when Brahm\u0101 inquired from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a whether this meant that there was more than one Brahm\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a smiled and at once called for many Brahm\u0101s from many universes. The four-headed Brahm\u0101 of this universe then saw innumerable other Brahm\u0101s coming to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and offer their respects. Some of them had ten heads, some had twenty, some had a hundred and some had a million heads. Upon seeing this wonderful exhibition, the four-headed Brahm\u0101 became nervous and began to think of himself as no more than a mosquito in the midst of many elephants. Therefore, what can Brahm\u0101 do to bewilder K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a?"

Just as a glowworm in the daytime and snow at night have no value, Brahm\u0101\u2019s mystic power became worthless in the presence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for greater mystic power condemns inferior mystic power. On a dark night, the darkness produced by snow has no meaning. The glowworm appears very important at night, but in the daytime its glow has no value; whatever little value it has is lost. Similarly, Brahm\u0101 became insignificant in the presence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mystic power. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s m\u0101y\u0101 was not diminished in value, but Brahm\u0101\u2019s m\u0101y\u0101 was condemned. Therefore, one should not try to exhibit one\u2019s insignificant opulence before a greater power."

        "purport": " Those Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms blessed the devotees with Their clear glances and smiles, which resembled the increasingly full light of the moon (\u015breya\u1e25-kairava-candrik\u0101-vitara\u1e47am). As maintainers, They glanced upon Their devotees, embracing them and protecting them by smiling. Their smiles resembled the mode of goodness, protecting all the desires of the devotees, and the glancing of Their eyes resembled the mode of passion. Actually, in this verse the word raja\u1e25 means not \u201cpassion\u201d but \u201caffection.\u201d In the material world, rajo-gu\u1e47a is passion, but in the spiritual world it is affection. In the material world, affection is contaminated by rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a, but in the \u015buddha-sattva the affection that maintains the devotees is transcendental. The word svak\u0101rth\u0101n\u0101m refers to great desires. As mentioned in this verse, the glance of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u creates the desires of the devotees. A pure devotee, however, has no desires. Therefore San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b comments that because the desires of devotees whose attention is fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a have already been fulfilled, the Lord\u2019s sidelong glances create variegated desires in relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and devotional service. In the material world, desire is a product of rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a, but desire in the spiritual world gives rise to a variety of everlasting transcendental service. Thus the word svak\u0101rth\u0101n\u0101m refers to eagerness to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana there is a place where there was no temple, but a devotee desired, \u201cLet there be a temple and sev\u0101, devotional service.\u201d Therefore, what was once an empty corner has now become a place of pilgrimage. Such are the desires of a devotee."

Therefore the mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, the topmost devotee, sees everyone as being engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; only himself does he see as not engaged. We have to elevate ourselves from a lower position to a higher position, and the topmost position is that of direct service in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. But everyone is engaged in service. Denial of the service of the Lord is m\u0101y\u0101. \u201cOnly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme master, and all others are His servants. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desires, everyone dances according to His tune.\u201d (Cc. \u0100di 5.142) There are two kinds of living entities \u2014 the moving and the nonmoving. Trees, for example, stand in one place, whereas ants move. Brahm\u0101 saw that all of them, down to the smallest creatures, had assumed different forms and were accordingly engaged in the service of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. One receives a form according to the way one worships the Lord. In the material world, the body one receives is guided by the demigods. This is sometimes referred to as the influence of the stars. As indicated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.27) by the words prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni, according to the laws of nature one is controlled by the demigods. All living entities are serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in different ways, but when they are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, their service is fully manifest. As a flower in the bud gradually fructifies and yields its desired aroma and beauty, so when a living entity comes to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the beauty of his real form comes into full blossom. That is the ultimate beauty and the ultimate fulfillment of desire."

We should always remember that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only supreme master and that everyone else is His servant (ekale \u012b\u015bvara k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u0101ra saba bh\u1e5btya). Be one even N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a or Lord \u015aiva, everyone is subordinate to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam). Even Baladeva is subordinate to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is a fact. One should understand that no one is independent, for everything is part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and is acting and moving by the supreme desire of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This understanding, this consciousness, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. \u201cA person who considers demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva to be on an equal level with N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a must certainly be considered an offender.\u201d No one can compare to N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Brahm\u0101 himself addressed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47as tva\u1e41 na hi sarva-dehin\u0101m: \u201cYou are also N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Indeed, You are the original N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.14) K\u0101la, or the time factor, has many assistants, such as svabh\u0101va, sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, k\u0101ma, karma and gu\u1e47a. Svabh\u0101va, or one\u2019s own nature, is formed according to the association of the material qualities. K\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go\u00a0\u2019sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu (Bg. 13.22). Sat and asat-svabh\u0101va \u2014 one\u2019s higher or lower nature \u2014 is formed by association with the different qualities, namely sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a. We should gradually come to the sattva-gu\u1e47a, so that we may avoid the two lower gu\u1e47as. This can be done if we regularly discuss \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities. Na\u1e63\u1e6da-pr\u0101ye\u1e63v abhadre\u1e63u nitya\u1e41 bh\u0101gavata-sevay\u0101 (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.18). All the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, beginning even with the pastimes concerning P\u016btan\u0101, are transcendental. Therefore, by hearing and discussing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a are subdued, so that only sattva-gu\u1e47a remains. Then rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a cannot do us any harm. Var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, therefore, is essential, for it can bring people to sattva-gu\u1e47a. Tad\u0101 rajas-tamo-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25 k\u0101ma-lobh\u0101daya\u015b ca ye (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.19). Tamo-gu\u1e47a and rajo-gu\u1e47a increase lust and greed, which implicate a living entity in such a way that he must exist in this material world in many, many forms. That is very dangerous. One should therefore be brought to sattva-gu\u1e47a by the establishment of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma and should develop the brahminical qualifications of being very neat and clean, rising early in the morning and seeing ma\u1e45gala-\u0101r\u0101trika, and so on. In this way, one should stay in sattva-gu\u1e47a, and then one cannot be influenced by tamo-gu\u1e47a and rajo-gu\u1e47a. The opportunity for this purification is the special feature of human life; in other lives, this is not possible. Such purification can be achieved very easily by r\u0101dh\u0101-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-bhajana, devotional service rendered to R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura sings, hari hari viphale janama go\u1e45\u0101inu, indicating that unless one worships R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one\u2019s human form of life is wasted. V\u0101sudeve bhagavati bhakti-yoga\u1e25 prayojita\u1e25/ janayaty \u0101\u015bu vair\u0101gyam (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.7). By engagement in the service of V\u0101sudeva, one very quickly renounces material life. The members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, for example, being engaged in v\u0101sudeva-bhakti, very quickly come to the stage of being nice Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, so much so that people are surprised that mlecchas and yavanas are able to come to this stage. This is possible by v\u0101sudeva-bhakti. But if we do not come to the stage of sattva-gu\u1e47a in this human life, then, as Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura sings, hari hari viphale janama go\u1e45\u0101inu \u2014 there is no profit in gaining this human form of life. \u015ar\u012b V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya comments that each of the items mentioned in the first half of this verse is a cause for material entanglement. K\u0101la, or the time factor, agitates the modes of material nature, and svabh\u0101va is the result of association with these modes. Therefore Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says, bhakta-sane v\u0101sa. If one associates with bhaktas, then one\u2019s svabh\u0101va, or nature, will change. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is meant to give people good association so that this change may take place, and we actually see that by this method people all over the world are gradually becoming devotees. As for sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, or reformation, this is possible by good association, for by good association one develops good habits, and habit becomes second nature. Therefore, bhakta-sane v\u0101sa: let people have the chance to live with bhaktas. Then their habits will change. In the human form of life one has this chance, but as Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura sings, hari hari viphale janama go\u1e45\u0101inu: if one fails to take advantage of this opportunity, one\u2019s human life is wasted. We are therefore trying to save human society from degradation and actually elevate people to the higher nature. As for k\u0101ma and karma \u2014 desires and activities \u2014 if one engages in devotional service, one develops a different nature than if one engages in activities of sense gratification, and of course the result is also different. According to the association of different natures, one receives a particular type of body. K\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go\u00a0\u2019sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu (Bg. 13.22). Therefore we should always seek good association, the association of devotees. Then our life will be successful. A man is known by his company. If one has the chance to live in the good association of devotees, one is able to cultivate knowledge, and naturally one\u2019s character or nature will change for one\u2019s eternal benefit."

This is also explained in the Upani\u1e63ads (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 3.2.3): \u201cThe Supreme Lord is not obtained by expert explanations, by vast intelligence, or even by much hearing. He is obtained only by one whom He Himself chooses. To such a person, He manifests His own form.\u201d One description given of Brahman is satya\u1e41 brahma, \u0101nanda-r\u016bpam: \u201cBrahman is the Absolute Truth and complete \u0101nanda, or bliss.\u201d The forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Brahman, were one, but They were manifested differently. The followers of the Upani\u1e63ads, however, cannot understand the varieties manifested by Brahman. This proves that Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101 can actually be understood only through devotion, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: bhakty\u0101ham ekay\u0101 gr\u0101hya\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 11.14.21). To establish that Brahman indeed has transcendental form, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura gives various quotations from the \u015b\u0101stras. In the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.8), the Supreme is described as \u0101ditya-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101t: \u201cHe whose self-manifest form is luminous like the sun and transcendental to the darkness of ignorance.\u201d \u0100nanda-m\u0101tram ajara\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47am eka\u1e41 santa\u1e41 bahudh\u0101 d\u1e5b\u015byam\u0101nam: \u201cThe Supreme is blissful, with no tinge of unhappiness. Although He is the oldest, He never ages, and although one, He is experienced in different forms.\u201d Sarve nity\u0101\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvat\u0101\u015b ca deh\u0101s tasya par\u0101tmana\u1e25: \u201cAll the forms of that Supreme Person are eternal.\u201d (Mah\u0101-var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a) The Supreme Person has a form, with hands and legs and other personal features, but His hands and legs are not material. Bhaktas know that the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Brahman, is not at all material. Rather, Brahman has a transcendental form, and when one is absorbed in it, being fully developed in bhakti, one can understand Him (prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena). The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, however, cannot understand this transcendental form, for they think that it is material. Transcendental forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His person are so great that the impersonal followers of the Upani\u1e63ads cannot reach the platform of knowledge to understand them. Particularly, the transcendental forms of the Lord are beyond the reach of the impersonalists, who can only understand, through the studies of the Upani\u1e63ads, that the Absolute Truth is not matter and that the Absolute Truth is not materially restricted by limited potency. Yet although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be seen through the Upani\u1e63ads, in some places it is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can in fact be known in this way. Aupani\u1e63ada\u1e41 puru\u1e63am: \u201cHe is known by the Upani\u1e63ads.\u201d This means that when one is purified by Vedic knowledge, one is then allowed to enter into devotional understanding (mad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m). \u201cThe seriously inquisitive student or sage, well equipped with knowledge and detachment, realizes that Absolute Truth by rendering devotional service in terms of what he has heard from the Ved\u0101nta-\u015bruti.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.12) The word \u015bruta-g\u1e5bh\u012btay\u0101 refers to Ved\u0101nta knowledge, not sentimentality. \u015aruta-g\u1e5bh\u012bta is sound knowledge. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Brahm\u0101 thus realized, is the reservoir of all truth, knowledge and bliss. He is the combination of these three transcendental features, and He is the object of worship for the followers of the Upani\u1e63ads. Brahm\u0101 realized that all the different forms of cows, boys and calves transformed into Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms were not transformed by mysticism of the type that a yog\u012b or demigod can display by specific powers invested in him. The cows, calves and boys transformed into vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brtis, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms, were not displays of vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u0101y\u0101, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u energy, but were Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Himself. The respective qualifications of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u0101y\u0101 are just like those of fire and heat. In heat there is the qualification of fire, namely warmth; and yet heat is not fire. The manifestation of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms of the boys, cows and calves was not like the heat, but rather like the fire \u2014 they were all actually Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Factually, the qualification of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is full truth, full knowledge and full bliss. Another example may be given with material objects, which may be reflected in many, many forms. For example, the sun is reflected in many waterpots, but the reflections of the sun in many pots are not actually the sun. There is no actual heat and light from the sun in the pot, although it appears as the sun. But each and every one of the forms K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a assumed was fully Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. We should discuss \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam daily as much as possible, and then everything will be clarified, for Bh\u0101gavatam is the essence of all Vedic literature (nigama-kalpa-taror galita\u1e41 phalam). It was written by Vy\u0101sadeva (mah\u0101-muni-k\u1e5bte) when he was self-realized. Thus the more we read \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the more its knowledge becomes clear. Each and every verse is transcendental."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, understanding Brahm\u0101\u2019s position, then at once removed the curtain of His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101.",
        "purport": " Brahm\u0101 was completely mystified. He could not understand what he was seeing, and then he was not even able to see. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, understanding Brahm\u0101\u2019s position, then removed that yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 covering. In this verse, Brahm\u0101 is referred to as ire\u015ba. Ir\u0101 means Sarasvat\u012b, the goddess of learning, and Ire\u015ba is her husband, Lord Brahm\u0101. Brahm\u0101, therefore, is most intelligent. But even Brahm\u0101, the lord of Sarasvat\u012b, was bewildered about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although he tried, he could not understand Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the beginning the boys, the calves and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself had been covered by yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, which later displayed the second set of calves and boys, who were K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s expansions, and which then displayed so many four-armed forms. Now, seeing Brahm\u0101\u2019s bewilderment, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a caused the disappearance of that yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. One may think that the m\u0101y\u0101 taken away by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, but \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments that it was yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, the potency by which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sometimes manifest and sometimes not manifest. The potency which covers the actual reality and displays something unreal is mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, but the potency by which the Absolute Truth is sometimes manifest and sometimes not is yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Therefore, in this verse the word aj\u0101 refers to yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy \u2014 His m\u0101y\u0101-\u015bakti, or svar\u016bpa-\u015bakti \u2014 is one, but it is manifested in varieties. Par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.8). The difference between Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs is that M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs say that this m\u0101y\u0101 is one, whereas Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas recognize its varieties. There is unity in variety. For example, in one tree, there are varieties of leaves, fruits and flowers. Varieties of energy are required for performing the varieties of activity within the creation. To give another example, in a machine all the parts may be iron, but the machine includes varied activities. Although the whole machine is iron, one part works in one way, and other parts work in other ways. One who does not know how the machine is working may say that it is all iron; nonetheless, in spite of its being iron, the machine has different elements, all working differently to accomplish the purpose for which the machine was made. One wheel runs this way, another wheel runs that way, functioning naturally in such a way that the work of the machine goes on. Consequently we give different names to the different parts of the machine, saying, \u201cThis is a wheel,\u201d \u201cThis is a screw,\u201d \u201cThis is a spindle,\u201d \u201cThis is the lubrication,\u201d and so on. Similarly, as explained in the Vedas: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s power is variegated, and thus the same \u015bakti, or potency, works in variegated ways. Vividh\u0101 means \u201cvarieties.\u201d There is unity in variety. Thus yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 and mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 are among the varied individual parts of the same one potency, and all of these individual potencies work in their own varied ways. The sa\u1e41vit, sandhin\u012b and \u0101hl\u0101din\u012b potencies \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s potency for existence, His potency for knowledge and His potency for pleasure \u2014 are distinct from yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Each is an individual potency. The \u0101hl\u0101din\u012b potency is R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. As Svar\u016bpa D\u0101modara Gosv\u0101m\u012b has explained, r\u0101dh\u0101 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pra\u1e47aya-vik\u1e5btir hl\u0101din\u012b \u015baktir asm\u0101t (Cc. \u0100di 1.5). The \u0101hl\u0101din\u012b-\u015bakti is manifested as R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b are the same, although one is potent and the other is potency. Brahm\u0101 was mystified about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s opulence (nija-mahimani) because this opulence was atarkya, or inconceivable. With one\u2019s limited senses, one cannot argue about that which is inconceivable. Therefore the inconceivable is called acintya, that which is beyond cintya, our thoughts and arguments. Acintya refers to that which we cannot contemplate but have to accept. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has said that unless we accept acintya in the Supreme, we cannot accommodate the conception of God. This must be understood. Therefore we say that the words of \u015b\u0101stra should be taken as they are, without change, since they are beyond our arguments. Acinty\u0101\u1e25 khalu ye bh\u0101v\u0101 na t\u0101\u1e41s tarke\u1e47a yojayet: \u201cThat which is acintya cannot be ascertained by argument.\u201d People generally argue, but our process is not to argue but to accept the Vedic knowledge as it is. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cThis is superior, and this is inferior,\u201d we accept what He says. It is not that we argue, \u201cWhy is this superior and that inferior?\u201d If one argues, for him the knowledge is lost. This path of acceptance is called avaroha-panth\u0101. The word avaroha is related to the word avat\u0101ra, which means \u201cthat which descends.\u201d The materialist wants to understand everything by the \u0101roha-panth\u0101 \u2014 by argument and reason \u2014 but transcendental matters cannot be understood in this way. Rather, one must follow the avaroha-panth\u0101, the process of descending knowledge. Therefore one must accept the parampar\u0101 system. And the best parampar\u0101 is that which extends from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (eva\u1e41 parampar\u0101-pr\u0101ptam). What K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, we should accept (ima\u1e41 r\u0101jar\u1e63ayo vidu\u1e25). This is called the avaroha-panth\u0101. Brahm\u0101, however, adopted the \u0101roha-panth\u0101. He wanted to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mystic power by his own limited, conceivable power, and therefore he himself was mystified. Everyone wants to take pleasure in his own knowledge, thinking, \u201cI know something.\u201d But in the presence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a this conception cannot stand, for one cannot bring K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within the limitations of prak\u1e5bti. One must submit. There is no alternative. Na t\u0101\u1e41s tarke\u1e47a yojayet. This submission marks the difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-ites and M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs. The phrase atan-nirasana refers to the discarding of that which is irrelevant. (Atat means \u201cthat which is not a fact.\u201d) Brahman is sometimes described as asth\u016blam ana\u1e47v ahrasvam ad\u012brgham, \u201cthat which is not large and not small, not short and not long.\u201d (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 5.8.8) Neti neti: \u201cIt is not this, it is not that.\u201d But what is it? In describing a pencil, one may say, \u201cIt is not this; it is not that,\u201d but this does not tell us what it is. This is called definition by negation. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also explains the soul by giving negative definitions. Na j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101: \u201cIt is not born, nor does it die. You can hardly understand more than this.\u201d But what is it? It is eternal. Ajo nitya\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvato\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47o na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre: \u201cIt is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. It is not slain when the body is slain.\u201d (Bg. 2.20) In the beginning the soul is difficult to understand, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has given negative definitions: \u201cThe soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can it be burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.\u201d (Bg. 2.23) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cIt is not burned by fire.\u201d Therefore, one has to imagine what it is that is not burned by fire. This is a negative definition."

        "purport": " The word vana means \u201cforest.\u201d We are afraid of the forest and do not wish to go there, but in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana the forest animals are as good as demigods, for they have no envy. Even in this material world, in the forest the animals live together, and when they go to drink water they do not attack anyone. Envy develops because of sense gratification, but in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana there is no sense gratification, for the only aim is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s satisfaction. Even in this material world, the animals in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are not envious of the s\u0101dhus who live there. The s\u0101dhus keep cows and supply milk to the tigers, saying, \u201cCome here and take a little milk.\u201d Thus envy and malice are unknown in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. That is the difference between V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and the ordinary world. We are horrified to hear the name of vana, the forest, but in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana there is no such horror. Everyone there is happy by pleasing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47otk\u012brtana-g\u0101na-nartana-parau. Whether a gosv\u0101m\u012b or a tiger or other ferocious animal, everyone\u2019s business is the same \u2014 to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even the tigers are also devotees. This is the specific qualification of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana everyone is happy. The calf is happy, the cat is happy, the dog is happy, the man is happy \u2014 everyone. Everyone wants to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a different capacity, and thus there is no envy. One may sometimes think that the monkeys in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana are envious, because they cause mischief and steal food, but in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana we find that the monkeys are allowed to take butter, which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself distributes. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally demonstrates that everyone has the right to live. This is V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana life. Why should I live and you die? No. That is material life. The inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana think, \u201cWhatever is given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, let us divide it as pras\u0101da and eat.\u201d This mentality cannot appear all of a sudden, but it will gradually develop with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; by s\u0101dhana, one can come to this platform. In the material world one may collect funds all over the world in order to distribute food freely, yet those to whom the food is given may not even feel appreciative. The value of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, will gradually be very much appreciated. For instance, in an article about the temple of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement in Durban, South Africa, the Durban Post reported, \u201cAll the devotees here are very active in the service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the results are obvious to see: happiness, good health, peace of mind, and the development of all good qualities.\u201d This is the nature of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Har\u0101v abhaktasya kuto mahad-gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e25: without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, happiness is impossible; one may struggle, but one cannot have happiness. We are therefore trying to give human society the opportunity for a life of happiness, good health, peace of mind and all good qualities through God consciousness."

        "translation": "Then Lord Brahm\u0101 saw the Absolute Truth \u2014 who is one without a second, who possesses full knowledge and who is unlimited \u2014 assuming the role of a child in a family of cowherd men and standing all alone, just as before, with a morsel of food in His hand, searching everywhere for the calves and His cowherd friends.",
        "purport": " The word ag\u0101dha-bodham, meaning \u201cfull of unlimited knowledge,\u201d is significant in this verse. The Lord\u2019s knowledge is unlimited, and therefore one cannot touch where it ends, just as one cannot measure the ocean. What is the extent of our intelligence in comparison to the vast expanse of water in the ocean? On my passage to America, how insignificant the ship was, like a matchbox in the midst of the ocean. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s intelligence resembles the ocean, for one cannot imagine how vast it is. The best course, therefore, is to surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Don\u2019t try to measure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The word advayam, meaning \u201cone without a second,\u201d is also significant. Because Brahm\u0101 was overcast by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s m\u0101y\u0101, he was thinking himself the Supreme. In the material world, everyone thinks, \u201cI am the best man in this world. I know everything.\u201d One thinks, \u201cWhy should I read Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101? I know everything. I have my own interpretation.\u201d Brahm\u0101, however, was able to understand that the Supreme Personality is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. Another of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s names, therefore, is parame\u015bvara. Now Brahm\u0101 saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing as a cowherd boy in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, not demonstrating His opulence but standing just like an innocent boy with some food in His hand, loitering with His cowherd boyfriends, calves and cows. Brahm\u0101 did not see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as catur-bhuja, the opulent N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; rather, he simply saw an innocent boy. Nonetheless, he could understand that although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not demonstrating His power, He was the same Supreme Person. People generally do not appreciate someone unless he shows something wonderful, but here, although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not manifest anything wonderful, Brahm\u0101 could understand that the same wonderful person was present like an ordinary child, although He was the master of the whole creation. Thus Brahm\u0101 prayed, govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi: \u201cYou are the original person, the cause of everything. I bow down to You.\u201d This was his realization. Tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi. This is what is wanted. Vede\u1e63u durlabham: one cannot reach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a merely by Vedic knowledge. Adurlabham \u0101tma-bhaktau: but when one becomes a devotee, then one can realize Him. Brahm\u0101, therefore, became a devotee. In the beginning he was proud of being Brahm\u0101, the lord of the universe, but now he understood, \u201cHere is the Lord of the universe. I am simply an insignificant agent. Govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was playing like a dramatic actor. Because Brahm\u0101 had some false prestige, thinking that he had some power, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed him his real position. A similar incident occurred when Brahm\u0101 went to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Dv\u0101rak\u0101. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s doorman informed Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that Lord Brahm\u0101 had arrived, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a responded, \u201cWhich Brahm\u0101? Ask him which Brahm\u0101.\u201d The doorman relayed this question, and Brahm\u0101 was astonished. \u201cIs there another Brahm\u0101 besides me?\u201d he thought. When the doorman informed Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cIt is four-headed Brahm\u0101,\u201d Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said, \u201cOh, four-headed. Call others. Show him.\u201d This is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s position. For K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the four-headed Brahm\u0101 is insignificant, to say nothing of \u201cfour-headed scientists.\u201d Materialistic scientists think that although this planet earth is full of opulence, all others are vacant. Because they simply speculate, this is their scientific conclusion. But from the Bh\u0101gavatam we understand that the entire universe is full of living entities everywhere. Thus it is the folly of the scientists that although they do not know anything, they mislead people by presenting themselves as scientists, philosophers and men of knowledge."

        "translation": "After seeing this, Lord Brahm\u0101 hastily got down from his swan carrier, fell down like a golden rod and touched the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with the tips of the four crowns on his heads. Offering his obeisances, he bathed the feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with the water of his tears of joy.",
        "purport": " Lord Brahm\u0101 bowed down like a stick, and because Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s complexion is golden, he appeared to be like a golden stick lying down before Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When one falls down before a superior just like a stick, one\u2019s offering of obeisances is called da\u1e47\u1e0davat. Da\u1e47\u1e0da means \u201cstick,\u201d and vat means \u201clike.\u201d It is not that one should simply say \u201cDa\u1e47\u1e0davat.\u201d Rather, one must fall down. Thus Brahm\u0101 fell down, touching his foreheads to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and his crying in ecstasy is to be regarded as an abhi\u1e63eka bathing ceremony of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet. He who appeared before Brahm\u0101 as a human child was in fact the Absolute Truth, Parabrahman (brahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate). The Supreme Lord is nar\u0101k\u1e5bti; that is, He resembles a human being. It is not that He is four-armed (catur-b\u0101hu). N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is catur-b\u0101hu, but the Supreme Person resembles a human being. This is also confirmed in the Bible, where it is said that man was made in the image of God. Lord Brahm\u0101 saw that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in His form as a cowherd boy, was Parabrahman, the root cause of everything, but was now appearing as a human child, loitering in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana with a morsel of food in His hand. Astonished, Lord Brahm\u0101 hastily got down from his swan carrier and let his body fall to the earth. Usually, the demigods never touch the ground, but Lord Brahm\u0101, voluntarily giving up his prestige as a demigod, bowed down on the ground before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although Brahm\u0101 has one head in each direction, he voluntarily brought all his heads to the ground and touched K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s feet with the tips of his four helmets. Although his intelligence works in every direction, he surrendered everything before the boy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is mentioned that Brahm\u0101 washed the feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with his tears, and here the word sujalai\u1e25 indicates that his tears were purified. As soon as bhakti is present, everything is purified (sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmuktam). Therefore Brahm\u0101\u2019s crying was a form of bhakty-anubh\u0101va, a transformation of transcendental ecstatic love."

        "purport": " Brahm\u0101, being very joyful, began to shed tears, and he washed the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with his tears. Repeatedly he fell and rose as he recalled the wonderful activities of the Lord. After repeating obeisances for a long time, Brahm\u0101 stood up and smeared his hands over his eyes. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments that the word locane indicates that with his two hands he wiped the two eyes on each of his four faces. Seeing the Lord before him, Brahm\u0101 began to offer prayers with great humility, respect and attention."
