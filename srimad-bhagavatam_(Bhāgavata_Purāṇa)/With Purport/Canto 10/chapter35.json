Then, in the company of Balar\u0101ma and the cowherd boys, He plays His flute to call the cows. At that time the rivers stop flowing, their water stunned by the ecstasy they feel as they eagerly wait for the wind to bring them the dust of His lotus feet. But like us, the rivers are not very pious, and thus they merely wait with their arms trembling out of love.",
        "purport": " The gop\u012bs state here that the sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute causes even inanimate objects like rivers to become conscious and then stunned in ecstasy. Just as the gop\u012bs could not always be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s physical association, the rivers could not come to the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. Although they desired the Lord, their movement was checked by ecstasy, and their \u201carms,\u201d their waves, trembled with love of Godhead."

He thus appears just like the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibiting His inexhaustible opulences. When the cows wander onto the mountainsides and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a calls out to them with the sound of His flute, the trees and creepers in the forest respond by becoming so luxuriant with fruits and flowers that they seem to be manifesting Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u within their hearts. As their branches bend low with the weight, the filaments on their trunks and vines stand erect out of the ecstasy of love of God, and both the trees and the creepers pour down a rain of sweet sap.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has made several illuminating comments on these verses. He gives the analogy that just as when householder Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas hear a sa\u1e45k\u012brtana party approaching they become ecstatic and offer obeisances, so the trees and creepers in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana became ecstatic when they heard K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s flute and bowed low with their branches and vines. The word dar\u015ban\u012bya-tilaka in text 10 indicates not only that the Lord is \u201cthe most excellent (to see),\u201d but also that He decorated Himself with attractive reddish tilaka taken from the mineral-rich earth of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana forest. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b also points out that tulas\u012b, although exalted in many ways, is not normally considered an especially fragrant plant. However, early in the morning tulas\u012b emits a transcendental fragrance that ordinary people cannot perceive but that transcendental personalities fully appreciate. The bees who are privileged to swarm about the flower garlands worn by the Supreme Personality of Godhead certainly appreciate this fragrance, and \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b quotes from the Bh\u0101gavatam (3.15.19) to the effect that the most fragrant plants in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha also appreciate the special qualifications of Tulas\u012b-dev\u012b. The word sandhita-ve\u1e47u\u1e25 in text 10 indicates that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a placed His flute firmly upon His lips. And the melody emanating from that flute is certainly the most enchanting of sounds, as the gop\u012bs describe in this chapter."

Thus He delights the entire world. At that time the nearby cloud, afraid of offending a great personality, thunders very gently in accompaniment. The cloud showers flowers onto his dear friend K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and shades Him from the sun like an umbrella.",

And such qualities as being colored like sandalwood-pulp tilaka [speckled] or having a head shaped like a m\u1e5bda\u1e45ga drum create eight further groups. To count these 108 groups of cows, distinguished by color and form, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is using a string of 108 jewel-beads.\u2026 \u201cThus when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a calls out \u2018Hey Dhaval\u012b [the name of a white cow],\u2019 a whole group of white cows come forward, and when He calls \u2018Ha\u1e41s\u012b, Candan\u012b, Ga\u1e45g\u0101, Mukt\u0101\u2018 and so on, the twenty-four other groups of white cows come. The reddish cows are called Aru\u1e47\u012b, Ku\u1e45kuma, Sarasvat\u012b, etc., the blackish ones \u015ay\u0101mal\u0101, Dh\u016bmal\u0101, Yamun\u0101, etc., and the yellowish ones P\u012bt\u0101, Pi\u1e45gal\u0101, Harit\u0101lik\u0101, etc. Those in the group with tilaka marks on their foreheads are called Citrit\u0101, Citra-tilak\u0101, D\u012brgha-tilak\u0101 and Tiryak-tilak\u0101, and there are groups known as M\u1e5bda\u1e45ga-mukh\u012b [m\u1e5bda\u1e45ga-head], Si\u1e41ha-mukh\u012b [lion-head] and so on. \u201cThus being called by name, the cows are coming forward, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, thinking that when it is time to bring them back from the forest none should be forgotten, is counting them on His jewel-beads.\u201d"
