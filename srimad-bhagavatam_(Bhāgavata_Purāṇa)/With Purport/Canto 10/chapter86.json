After they were all comfortably seated, the wise King, his heart overflowing with joy and his eyes clouded by tears, bowed down to them and washed their feet with intense devotion. Taking the wash water, which could purify the entire world, he sprinkled it on his head and the heads of his family members.

Therefore, when he found that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and all the great sages were at his home, he was astonished, and he began to thank Lord Krsna for His causeless mercy.\u201d The word \u012b\u015bvara in this verse refers not only to the Supreme Lord but also to the exalted sages in His company; this is confirmed by \u0100c\u0101ryas \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b and Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b."

The devotees of the Lord who are in the reciprocal mood of neutral admiration (\u015b\u0101nta-rasa) meditate on the Supreme as possessing a divine, personal form (\u0101tm\u0101 or \u015br\u012b-vigraha) transcending all aspects of material illusion.

Is not such activity pleasing to those who are actually afraid of material existence?\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 4.30.37) And Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja says: \u201cMy dear Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, I see that there are many saintly persons indeed, but they are interested only in their own deliverance. Not caring for the big cities and towns, they go to the Him\u0101layas or the forest to meditate with vows of silence [mauna-vrata]. They are not interested in delivering others. As for me, however, I do not wish to be liberated alone, leaving aside all these poor fools and rascals. I know that without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, without taking shelter of Your lotus feet, one cannot be happy. Therefore I wish to bring them back to shelter at Your lotus feet.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 7.9.44)"

        "translation": "O King, thus the Personality of Godhead, who is devoted to His own devotees, stayed for some time with His two great devotees \u015arutadeva and Bahul\u0101\u015bva, teaching them the behavior of perfect saints. Then the Lord returned to Dv\u0101rak\u0101.",
        "purport": " In his narration of this pastime in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup\u0101da concludes: \u201cThe instruction we receive from this incident is that King Bahul\u0101\u015bva and \u015arutadeva the br\u0101hma\u1e47a were accepted by the Lord on the same level because both were pure devotees. This is the real qualification for being recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because it has become the fashion of this age to become falsely proud of having taken birth in the family of a k\u1e63atriya or a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, we see persons without any qualification claiming to be br\u0101hma\u1e47a or k\u1e63atriya or vai\u015bya. But as it is stated in the scriptures, kalau \u015b\u016bdra-sambhava: \u2018In this Age of Kali, everyone is born a \u015b\u016bdra.\u2019 This is because there is no performance of the purificatory process known as sa\u1e41sk\u0101ras, which begin from the time of the mother\u2019s pregnancy and continue up to the point of the individual\u2019s death. No one can be classified as a member of a particular caste, especially of a higher caste \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya or vai\u015bya \u2014 simply by birthright. If one is not purified by the process of the seed-giving ceremony, or garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, he is immediately classified among the \u015b\u016bdras because only the \u015b\u016bdras do not undergo this purificatory process. Sex life without the purificatory process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is merely the seed-giving process of the \u015b\u016bdras or the animals. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the highest perfection, by which everyone can come to the platform of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. This includes having all the qualifications of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are trained to become freed from the four kinds of sinful activities \u2014 illicit sex, indulgence in intoxicants, gambling and eating animal foodstuffs. No one can be on the brahminical platform without having these preliminary qualifications, and without becoming a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a, one cannot become a pure devotee.\u201d"
