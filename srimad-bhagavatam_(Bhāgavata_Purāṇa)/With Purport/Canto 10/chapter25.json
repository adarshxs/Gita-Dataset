Therefore as demigods, or as servants of the Lord, their existence is pure (sad-bh\u0101va). When the demigods fail to live up to the high position given them by the Lord and deviate from proper behavior, they are not acting as demigods but rather as conditioned souls. M\u0101na, or false prestige, is certainly an anxiety-ridden burden for the conditioned soul. A falsely proud person is not truly peaceful or satisfied, because his understanding of himself is false and inflated. When a servant of the Lord becomes asat, or irreligious, the Lord saves him from impiety by breaking the false prestige that has led him to be offensive or sinful. As stated by the Lord Himself, yasy\u0101ham anug\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101mi hari\u1e63ye tad-dhana\u1e41 \u015banai\u1e25: \u201cI give My blessings to a person by taking away his so-called opulence.\u201d Of course, the advanced stage of devotional service to the Lord, as described by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, is yukta-vair\u0101gya, utilizing the opulence of this world to execute the Lord\u2019s mission. Obviously the things of this world can be used wonderfully to spread the glories of God and to create a godly society, and a more advanced devotee will not be seduced by material paraphernalia but will dutifully and honestly engage it solely for the pleasure of the Lord. In this particular case, Lord Indra forgot that he was a humble servant of God, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore arranged to bring this bewildered demigod to his senses."

However, because the hill was in ecstasy, being touched by the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it acquired inconceivable power and even felt the hundreds of deadly thunderbolts thrown upon its back by angry Indra to be offerings of soft, fragrant flowers. At times \u015ar\u012b Govardhana was not even aware that the thunderbolts were striking. From the Hari-va\u1e41\u015ba the \u0101c\u0101rya has also quoted \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself as saying, trai-lokyam apy utsahate rak\u1e63itu\u1e41 ki\u1e41 punar vrajam: \u201c\u015ar\u012b Govardhana can give shelter to all the three worlds, what to speak of the simple land of Vraja.\u201d When Indra\u2019s attack began and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a lifted the hill, the deer, wild hogs, and other animals and birds standing on the hill\u2019s flanks climbed up to its peaks, and even they did not experience the slightest distress."

Ordinarily they could not publicly talk about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, since they were chaste young girls in a religious village, but now they took advantage of this wonderful exhibition by the Lord and freely sang of His beautiful qualities. It is natural that a young man wants to do something wonderful in the presence of a beautiful young girl. The gop\u012bs were the most beautiful and pure-hearted young girls, and \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a performed the most wonderful activities in their presence. Thus He entered deep within their tender hearts, enlivening their eternal devotion to Him."
