Here we find that in household affairs, ladies could take charge of protecting a child simply by taking help from the cow. As described here, they knew how to wave about the switch of a cow so as to protect the child from all types of danger. There are so many facilities afforded by cow protection, but people have forgotten these arts. The importance of protecting cows is therefore stressed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (k\u1e5b\u1e63i-go-rak\u1e63ya-v\u0101\u1e47ijya\u1e41 vai\u015bya-karma svabh\u0101vajam). Even now in the Indian villages surrounding V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the villagers live happily simply by giving protection to the cow. They keep cow dung very carefully and dry it to use as fuel. They keep a sufficient stock of grains, and because of giving protection to the cows, they have sufficient milk and milk products to solve all economic problems. Simply by giving protection to the cow, the villagers live so peacefully. Even the urine and stool of cows have medicinal value."

        "purport": " As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.33): \u201cI worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is the original person \u2014 nondual, infallible, and without beginning. Although He expands into unlimited forms, He is still the original, and although He is the oldest person, He always appears as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful and all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot be understood by the academic wisdom of the Vedas, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.\u201d While decorating the body with tilaka, we give protection to the body by chanting twelve names of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Although Govinda, or Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is one, He has different names and forms with which to act differently. But if one cannot remember all the names at one time, one may simply chant, \u201cLord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u,\u201d and always think of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47or \u0101r\u0101dhana\u1e41 param: this is the highest form of worship. If one remembers Vi\u1e63\u1e47u always, even though one is disturbed by many bad elements, one can be protected without a doubt. The \u0100yurveda-\u015b\u0101stra recommends, au\u1e63adhi cintayet vi\u1e63\u1e47um: even while taking medicine, one should remember Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, because the medicine is not all and all and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the real protector. The material world is full of danger (pada\u1e41 pada\u1e41 yad vipad\u0101m). Therefore one must become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and think of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u constantly. This is made easier by the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra.

What then is to be said of those who had natural devotion and affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as mothers and who offered Him their breasts to suck or offered something very dear, as a mother offers something to a child?",

Nonetheless, because with or without knowledge she offered her breast, she attained the highest achievement in life. But the offerings of devotees attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in parental love are always sincere. A mother likes to offer something to her child with affection and love; there is no question of envy. So here we can make a comparative study. If P\u016btan\u0101 could attain such an exalted position in spiritual life by neglectfully, enviously making an offering to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, what is to be said of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and the other gop\u012bs, who served K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with such great affection and love, offering everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s satisfaction? The gop\u012bs automatically achieved the highest perfection. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu recommended the affection of the gop\u012bs, either in maternal affection or in conjugal love, as the highest perfection in life (ramy\u0101 k\u0101cid up\u0101san\u0101 vrajavadh\u016b-varge\u1e47a y\u0101 kalpit\u0101)."

P\u016btan\u0101 was neither a devotee nor a nondevotee; she was actually a demoniac witch instructed by Ka\u1e41sa to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nonetheless, in the beginning she assumed the form of a very beautiful woman and approached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exactly like an affectionate mother, so that mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and Rohi\u1e47\u012b did not doubt her sincerity. The Lord took all this into consideration, and thus she was automatically promoted to a position like that of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. As explained by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, there are various roles one may play in such a position. P\u016btan\u0101 was immediately promoted to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, which is also sometimes described as Svarga. The Svarga mentioned in this verse is not the material heavenly planet, but the transcendental world. In Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, P\u016btan\u0101 attained the position of a nurse (dh\u0101try-ucit\u0101m), as described by Uddhava.

For that Personality of Godhead, the gop\u012bs always felt maternal love, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sucked their breasts with full satisfaction. Therefore, because of their relationship as mother and son, although the gop\u012bs were engaged in various family activities, one should never think that they returned to this material world after leaving their bodies.",
        "purport": " The advantage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is described herein. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness gradually develops on the transcendental platform. One may think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme personality, one may think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme master, one may think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme friend, one may think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme son, or one may think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme conjugal lover. If one is connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in any of these transcendental relationships, the course of one\u2019s material life is understood to have already ended. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9), tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti: for such devotees, going back home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. Na puna\u1e25 kalpate r\u0101jan sa\u1e41s\u0101ro j\u00f1\u0101na-sambhava\u1e25. This verse also guarantees that devotees who constantly think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a particular relationship will never return to this material world. In this material world of sa\u1e41s\u0101ra, there are the same relationships. One thinks, \u201cHere is my son,\u201d \u201cHere is my wife,\u201d \u201cHere is my lover,\u201d or \u201cHere is my friend.\u201d But these relationships are temporary illusions. Aj\u00f1\u0101na-sambhava\u1e25: such a consciousness awakens in ignorance. But when the same relationships awaken in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one\u2019s spiritual life is revived, and one is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead. Even though the gop\u012bs who were friends of Rohi\u1e47\u012b and mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and who allowed their breasts to be sucked by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were not directly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mothers, they all had the same chance as Rohi\u1e47\u012b and Ya\u015bod\u0101 to go back to Godhead and act as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mothers-in-law, servants and so on. The word sa\u1e41s\u0101ra refers to attachment for one\u2019s body, home, husband or wife, and children, but although the gop\u012bs and all the other inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana had the same affection and attachment for husband and home, their central affection was for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in some transcendental relationship, and therefore they were guaranteed to be promoted to Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in the next life, to live with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a eternally in spiritual happiness. The easiest way to attain spiritual elevation, to be liberated from this material world, and to go back home, back to Godhead, is recommended by Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura: k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era sa\u1e41s\u0101ra kara ch\u0101\u1e0di\u2019 an\u0101c\u0101ra. One should give up all sinful activities and remain in the family of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then one\u2019s liberation is guaranteed."
