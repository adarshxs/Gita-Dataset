        "purport": " Draupad\u012b is the chief hearer in this assembly of exalted women, since, as explained by \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, she had asked the question that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s queens answered by relating their respective stories. Since G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b and the other ladies named here were not even mentioned in the previous chapter as having been present, \u0100c\u0101rya \u015ar\u012bdhara concludes that they must have heard the queens\u2019 narrations only secondhand. Indeed, Draupad\u012b would never have spoken so freely in the presence of P\u1e5bth\u0101 and G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b, her elders, or before the gop\u012bs, whose attitude toward the queens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 was not particularly sympathetic. Even though the gop\u012bs joined in shedding tears, it was more because of their being reminded of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes than because of any loving affinity between them and the queens. We should remember, of course, that there is always perfect harmony on the spiritual platform. Apparent conflict between pure devotees is nothing like mundane envy and strife. The jealousy of the gop\u012bs was more show than substance, being exhibited by them as an ecstatic symptom of their overflowing love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101mip\u0101da further analyzes the phrase sva-gopya\u1e25 as implying that these gop\u012bs were the queens\u2019 sva-svar\u016bpa, the original prototypes of whom the queens were specific expansions."

But ordinary demigods are not absolute, being infinitesimal spirit souls, and thus representations of the demigods are not identical with them. Worship of demigods or ritual bathing in a sanctified place gives only limited benefit to those who lack transcendental faith in the Supreme Lord. On the other hand, great Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava saints like Vy\u0101sadeva, N\u0101rada and the four Kum\u0101ras are always absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thus they are veritable moving t\u012brthas, places of pilgrimage.

Association with advanced sages, either directly or by hearing their instructions, is recommended in this verse for one who wishes to advance beyond the lowest stages of devotional life. A neophyte devotee may be free from the more obvious sins of violence against innocent creatures and against his own body and mind, but until he becomes very advanced on the devotional path, he must always contend with the subtler contaminations of false pride, disrespect toward respectable Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and lack of compassion for suffering creatures.

        "purport": " Things of this world are inevitably destroyed by one means or another. Time itself causes the eventual decay of every created being \u2014 a fruit, for instance, which may grow ripe but then must either rot or be eaten. Some things, like lightning, destroy themselves as soon as they are manifested, while others are destroyed suddenly by external agents, as a clay pot is by a hammer. Even in living bodies and other things whose existence continues for some time, there is a constant flux of various qualities that are destroyed and replaced by others. In contrast to all of this, the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s awareness is never disrupted by anything. Only out of ignorance could one imagine Him to be an ordinary human being subject to material conditions. Mortal beings are covered by their entanglement in fruitive activities and their consequent happiness and distress, but the Supreme Lord cannot be covered by what are in fact His own expansions. Analogously, the immense sun is the source of the relatively insignificant phenomena of clouds, snow and eclipses, and so it cannot be covered by them, though the ordinary observer may think that it is."

When one is uneducated but falsely puffed up by wealth, the result is that one engages his wealth in enjoying wine, women and gambling.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.10.8)"

        "translation": "Then, after Vasudeva, Ugrasena, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Uddhava, Balar\u0101ma and others had fulfilled his desires and presented him with precious ornaments, fine linen and varieties of priceless household furnishings, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja accepted all these gifts and took his leave. Seen off by all the Yadus, he departed with his family members and the residents of Vraja.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, at the end of the three months Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda approached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and told Him, \u201cMy dear son, for one drop of perspiration from Your divine face I am ready to give up countless lives. Let us leave now for Vraja; I cannot spend any more time here.\u201d Then he went to Vasudeva and told him, \u201cMy dear friend, please send K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Vraja,\u201d and of King Ugrasena he requested, \u201cPlease order my friend to do this. If you refuse, I will have to drown myself here in Lord Para\u015bur\u0101ma\u2019s lake. Just watch, if you do not believe me! We people of Vraja came to this holy place not to gain some piety on the occasion of the solar eclipse, but to get K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a back or die.\u201d Hearing these desperate words from Nanda, Vasudeva and the others tried to pacify him with valuable gifts. Well-versed in the arts of diplomacy, Vasudeva consulted with his most trustworthy advisors and then satisfied \u015ar\u012b Nanda by telling him, \u201cMy dearest friend, O King of Vraja, it is of course true that none of you can live without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And how can we allow you to kill yourselves? Therefore, by all means I must send K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a back to Vraja. I will do so right after we accompany Him and His relatives and friends \u2014 among them many helpless women \u2014 back to Dv\u0101rak\u0101. Then, the very next day, without trying to obstruct Him in any way, I will let Him leave for Vraja at an auspicious time of the day. This I swear to you a thousand times over. After all, how can we who came here with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a go home without Him? What will people say about us? You are a great scholar in all matters, so please forgive me for making this request of you.\u201d Next Ugrasena addressed Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja: \u201cMy dear master of Vraja, I bear witness to Vasudeva\u2019s statement and take this solemn vow: I will send K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a back to Vraja even if I have to do it by force.\u201d Then Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, joined by Uddhava and Balar\u0101ma, spoke to Nanda in private. He said, \u201cDear father, if I go directly to Vraja today, leaving aside all these V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is, they will die from the pain of separation from Me. Then many thousands of enemies more powerful than even Ke\u015b\u012b and Ari\u1e63\u1e6da will come to annihilate all these kings. \u201cSince I am omniscient, I know what is inevitably going to happen to Me. Listen and I will describe it to you. After returning to Dv\u0101rak\u0101, I will receive an invitation from Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and will go to Indraprastha to participate in his R\u0101jas\u016bya sacrifice. There I will kill \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la, after which I will again return to Dv\u0101rak\u0101 and kill \u015a\u0101lva. Next I will travel to a place just south of Mathur\u0101 to save you by killing Dantavakra. I will then go back to Vraja, see all My old friends and again sit in your lap with great pleasure. Indeed, with great happiness I will spend the rest of My life with you. God has written this fate on My forehead, and it has been written on your foreheads that until the day I return you must tolerate separation from Me. Neither of our destinies can possibly be changed, so please find the courage to leave Me here for now and go home to Vraja. \u201cAnd if, in the meantime, you, My dear parents, and you, My beloved friends, are distressed by the unavoidable fate written on our foreheads, then whenever you wish to feed Me some delicacy or play some game with Me or simply see Me, just close your eyes and I will appear before you to turn your torment into sky-flowers and fulfill all your desires. I promise you this, and the young friends of Mine whose lives I saved in a forest fire can vouch for it.\u201d Convinced by all these arguments that his son\u2019s happiness was of prime importance, Nanda accepted the gifts offered him and took his leave, accompanied by the Yadus\u2019 large army."
