In the context of the current episode of Sud\u0101m\u0101\u2019s visit to Dv\u0101rak\u0101, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b has kindly continued his explanation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statements: This verse is a reply to Sud\u0101m\u0101\u2019s anxiety that his bringing such an unfit offering was ill-considered. The use of the words bhakty\u0101 prayacchati and bhakty-upah\u1e5btam may seem redundant, since they both mean \u201coffered with devotion,\u201d but bhakty\u0101 can indicate how the Lord reciprocates the devotional mood of whoever offers Him something with love. In other words, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here declares that His reciprocation in a pure loving exchange is not dependent on the external quality of what is offered. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cSomething may or may not be impressive and pleasing in its own right, but when My devotee offers it to Me in devotion, with the expectation that I will enjoy it, it gives Me great pleasure; in this regard I make no discrimination.\u201d The verb a\u015bn\u0101mi, \u201cI eat,\u201d implies that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a eats even a flower, which is supposed to be smelled, bewildered as He is by the ecstatic love He feels for His devotee. Someone might then question the Lord, \u201cSo, will You refuse an offering made to You by a devotee of some other deity?\u201d The Lord answers, \u201cYes, I will refuse to eat it.\u201d This the Lord states by the phrase prayat\u0101tmana\u1e25, implying \u201cOnly by devotional service to Me can one become pure in heart.\u201d"

Thus He thought, \u201cIn the past My friend has never worshiped Me out of a desire for material opulence, but now he comes to Me to satisfy his chaste and devoted wife. I will give him riches that even the immortal demigods cannot obtain.\u201d",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b comments that the Lord momentarily wondered, \u201cHow has it come about, despite My omniscience, that this devotee of Mine has fallen into such poverty?\u201d Then, quickly understanding the situation, He spoke to Himself the words related in this verse. But someone may point out that Sud\u0101m\u0101 should not have been so poverty-stricken, since appropriate enjoyment comes as a by-product of service to God even for a devotee who has no ulterior motives. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.22): \u201cBut those who always worship Me with exclusive devotion, meditating on My transcendental form \u2014 to them I carry what they lack, and I preserve what they have.\u201d In response to this point, a distinction must be made between two kinds of renounced devotees: one kind is inimical to sense gratification, and the other is indifferent to it. The Supreme Lord does not force sense gratification upon the devotee who is extremely averse to worldly enjoyments. This is seen among such great renouncers as Ja\u1e0da Bharata. On the other hand, the Lord may give limitless wealth and power to a devotee who is neither repelled nor attracted by material things, such as Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Up to this point in his life, Sud\u0101m\u0101 Br\u0101hma\u1e47a was totally averse to sense gratification, but now, out of compassion for his faithful wife \u2014 and also because he hankered to have K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s audience \u2014 he went to beg from the Lord."
