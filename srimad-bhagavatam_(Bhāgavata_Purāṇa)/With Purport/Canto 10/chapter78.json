When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, moreover, heard of this, He mounted His chariot and went to Mathur\u0101.\u201d Tayor dantavakra-v\u0101sudevayor aho-r\u0101tra\u1e41 mathur\u0101-dv\u0101ri sa\u1e45gr\u0101ma\u1e25 samavartata; k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu gaday\u0101 ta\u1e41 jagh\u0101na; sa tu c\u016br\u1e47ita-sarv\u0101\u1e45go vajra-nirbhinno mah\u012bdhara iva gat\u0101sur avani-tale nipap\u0101ta; so\u00a0\u2019pi hare\u1e25 s\u0101r\u016bpye\u1e47a yogi-gamya\u1e41 nity\u0101nanda-sukha-da\u1e41 \u015b\u0101\u015bvata\u1e41 parama\u1e41 padam av\u0101pa: \u201cBetween the two of them \u2014 Dantavakra and Lord V\u0101sudeva \u2014 there then began a battle at the gate of Mathur\u0101 that lasted all day and night. Finally K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a struck Dantavakra with His club, at which point Dantavakra fell lifeless to the ground, all his limbs smashed like a mountain shattered by a lightning bolt. Dantavakra achieved the liberation of gaining a form equal to the Lord\u2019s, and thus he also achieved the Lord\u2019s eternal, supreme abode, attainable by perfect yog\u012bs, which bestows the happiness of everlasting spiritual bliss.\u201d Ittha\u1e41 jaya-vijayau sanak\u0101di-\u015b\u0101pa-vy\u0101jena kevala\u1e41 bhagavato l\u012bl\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa\u1e41s\u1e5bt\u0101v avat\u012brya janma-traye\u00a0\u2019pi tenaiva nihatau janma-tray\u0101vas\u0101ne muktim av\u0101ptau: \u201cSo it was that Jaya and Vijaya \u2014 apparently because of being cursed by Sanaka and his brothers but actually to facilitate the Supreme Lord\u2019s pastimes \u2014 descended to this material world and in three consecutive lifetimes were killed by the Lord Himself. Then, at the completion of these three lifetimes, they attained liberation.\u201d In this passage of the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a the words k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu tac chrutv\u0101, \u201cwhen K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a heard of this,\u201d indicate that the Lord heard from N\u0101rada, who travels as swiftly as the mind, that Dantavakra had gone to Mathur\u0101. Therefore immediately after killing \u015a\u0101lva, without first entering Dv\u0101rak\u0101, the Lord reached the vicinity of Mathur\u0101 in a single moment on His chariot, which also moves as swiftly as the mind, and there He saw Dantavakra. Thus it is that even today, by the gate of Mathur\u0101 facing the direction of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, there is a village known in the vernacular as Datih\u0101, a name derived from the Sanskrit dantavakra-ha, \u201ckiller of Dantavakra.\u201d This village was founded by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s great-grandson Vajra. In the same section of the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, these statements follow: k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019pi ta\u1e41 hatv\u0101 yamun\u0101m utt\u012brya nanda-vraja\u1e41 gatv\u0101 sotka\u1e47\u1e6dhau pitar\u0101v abhiv\u0101dy\u0101\u015bv\u0101sya t\u0101bhy\u0101\u1e41 s\u0101\u015bru-sekam \u0101li\u1e45gita\u1e25 sakala-gopa-v\u1e5bddh\u0101n pra\u1e47amya bahu-vastr\u0101bhara\u1e47\u0101dibhis tatra-sth\u0101n santarpay\u0101m \u0101sa. \u201cAnd after killing him [Vid\u016bratha], K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a crossed the Yamun\u0101 and went to the cowherd village of Nanda, where He honored and consoled His aggrieved parents. They drenched Him with tears and embraced Him, and then the Lord offered obeisances to the elder cowherd men and gratified all the residents with abundant gifts of clothing, ornaments and so on.\u201d \u201cLord Ke\u015bava sported continuously with the cowherd women on the K\u0101lind\u012b\u2019s charming bank, which was filled with pious trees. Thus the Supreme Lord, assuming the appearance of a cowherd, resided there for two months, enjoying the pleasure of intimate pastimes in various moods of loving reciprocation.\u201d Atha tatra-sth\u0101 nanda-gop\u0101daya\u1e25 sarve jan\u0101\u1e25 putra-d\u0101r\u0101di-sahit\u0101 v\u0101sudeva-pras\u0101dena divya-r\u016bpa-dhar\u0101 vim\u0101nam \u0101r\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25 parama\u1e41 vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-lokam av\u0101pu\u1e25; k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu nanda-gopa-vrajaukas\u0101\u1e41 sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 nir\u0101maya\u1e41 sva-pada\u1e41 dattv\u0101 divi deva-ga\u1e47ai\u1e25 sa\u1e41st\u016byam\u0101no dv\u0101ravat\u012b\u1e41 vive\u015ba: \u201cThen, by Lord V\u0101sudeva\u2019s grace, Nanda and all the other residents of that place, together with their children and wives, assumed their eternal, spiritual forms, boarded a celestial airplane and ascended to the supreme Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet [Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana]. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, after bestowing on Nanda Gopa and all the other inhabitants of Vraja His own transcendental abode, which is free of all disease, traveled through the sky and returned to Dv\u0101rak\u0101 as demigods chanted His praises.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b comments as follows on this passage in his Laghu-bh\u0101gavat\u0101m\u1e5bta (1.488-89): \u201cSince Dro\u1e47a and other demigods had previously descended to earth to merge as partial expansions into the King of Vraja and other devotees of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, at this time it was these demigod expansions whom Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sent off to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Lord Hari is perpetually enjoying pastimes in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana with His intimate devotees, the residents of Gokula, who are dearer to Him than even His most dear other devotees.\u201d In the passage of the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the word putra in the phrase nanda-gop\u0101daya\u1e25 sarve jan\u0101\u1e25 putra-d\u0101r\u0101di-sahit\u0101\u1e25 (\u201cNanda Gopa and the others, together with their children and wives\u201d) refers to such sons as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101 and Subala, while the word d\u0101ra refers to such wives as \u015ar\u012b Ya\u015bod\u0101 and K\u012brtid\u0101, the mother of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. The phrase sarve jan\u0101\u1e25 (\u201call the people\u201d) refers to everyone living in the district of Vraja. Thus they all went to the topmost Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet, Goloka. The phrase divya-r\u016bpa-dhar\u0101\u1e25 indicates that in Goloka they engage in pastimes appropriate to demigods, not those suited to humans, as in Gokula. Just as during Lord R\u0101macandra\u2019s incarnation the residents of Ayodhy\u0101 were transported to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha in their selfsame bodies, so in this incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the residents of Vraja attained to Goloka in theirs. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s journey from Dv\u0101rak\u0101 to Vraja is confirmed by the following passage of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.11.9): yarhy ambuj\u0101k\u1e63\u0101pasas\u0101ra bho bhav\u0101n kur\u016bn madh\u016bn v\u0101tha suh\u1e5bd-did\u1e5bk\u1e63ay\u0101/ tatr\u0101bda-ko\u1e6di-pratima\u1e25 k\u1e63a\u1e47o bhavet. \u201cO lotus-eyed Lord, whenever You go away to Mathur\u0101, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or Hastin\u0101pura to meet Your friends and relatives, every moment of Your absence seems like a million years.\u201d Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had been harboring a desire to go see His friends and relatives in Vraja ever since Lord Baladeva had gone there, but His mother, father and other elders in Dv\u0101rak\u0101 had refused to give Him permission. Now, however, after the killing of \u015a\u0101lva, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a heard from N\u0101rada that Dantavakra had gone to Mathur\u0101, no one could object to the Lord\u2019s going there immediately without first entering Dv\u0101rak\u0101. And after killing Dantavakra, He would have the opportunity to meet with His friends and relatives living in Vraja. Thinking like this, and also remembering Uddhava\u2019s allusion to the gop\u012bs in the words g\u0101yanti te vi\u015bada-karma (Bh\u0101g. 10.71.9), He went to Vraja, dispelling the feelings of separation of the inhabitants. For two months Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enjoyed in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana just as before, previous to His leaving there to kill Ka\u1e41sa in Mathur\u0101. Then, at the end of two months, He withdrew His Vraja pastimes from mundane eyes by taking the demigod portions of His parents and other relatives and friends to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Thus, in one complete plenary manifestation He went to Goloka in the spiritual world, in another He remained perpetually enjoying in Vraja while invisible to material eyes, and in yet another He mounted His chariot and returned alone to Dv\u0101rak\u0101. The people of \u015aaurasena province thought that after killing Dantavakra K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had paid a visit to His parents and other dear ones and now was returning to Dv\u0101rak\u0101. The people of Vraja, on the other hand, could not understand where He had suddenly disappeared to, and so they were totally astonished. Furthermore, \u015aukadeva considered that Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja might think, \u201cHow is it that the same K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who caused the cowherds to attain Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha in their selfsame bodies also caused the residents of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 to attain such an inauspicious condition in the course of His mau\u1e63ala-l\u012bl\u0101?\u201d Thus the King might consider the arrangement unfair because of his own affinity for the Yadus. That is why \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b did not allow him to hear this pastime, which, as mentioned above, is related in the Uttara-kha\u1e47\u1e0da of \u015ar\u012b Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a. In \u015ar\u012b Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s commentary on the Tenth Canto, we find the following sequential list of pastimes: First was the journey on the occasion of the solar eclipse, then the R\u0101jas\u016bya assembly, then the gambling match and attempted disrobing of Draupad\u012b, then the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas\u2019 exile to the forest, then the killing of \u015a\u0101lva and Dantavakra, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s visit to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and finally the winding up of the V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana pastimes."
