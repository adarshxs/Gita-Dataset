And as bees drink only once of a flower\u2019s nectar and then leave it for another, fickle men abandon beautiful and devoted women to pursue other pleasures. This tendency is condemned here by the gop\u012bs, who gave their hearts completely to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The gop\u012bs wanted only to exhibit their charms for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pleasure, and in the pain of separation they questioned the motives of His friendship with them. These are the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Both Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the gop\u012bs are completely liberated souls engaged in spiritual loving affairs. By contrast, our so-called loving affairs, being perverted reflections of the perfect loving relationships in the spiritual world, are polluted with lust, greed, pride and so on. Like all liberated souls, the gop\u012bs \u2014 and certainly Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself \u2014 are eternally free of these lower qualities, and their intense loving affairs are motivated exclusively by unalloyed devotion."

        "purport": " In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da explains the meaning of this verse as follows: \u201c[\u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b said to the bee,] \u2018You poor messenger, you are only a less intelligent servant. You do not know much about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 how ungrateful and hardhearted He has been, not only in this life but in His previous lives also. We have all heard this from our grandmother Paur\u1e47am\u0101s\u012b. She has informed us that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was born in a k\u1e63atriya family previous to this birth and was known as R\u0101macandra. In that birth, instead of killing V\u0101li, an enemy of His friend, in the manner of a k\u1e63atriya, He killed him just like a hunter. A hunter takes a secure hiding place and then kills an animal without facing it. So Lord R\u0101macandra, as a k\u1e63atriya, should have fought with V\u0101li face to face, but instigated by His friend, He killed him from behind a tree. Thus He deviated from the religious principles of a k\u1e63atriya. Also, He was so attracted by the beauty of S\u012bt\u0101 that He converted \u015a\u016brpa\u1e47akh\u0101, the sister of R\u0101va\u1e47a, into an ugly woman by cutting off her nose and ears. \u015a\u016brpa\u1e47akh\u0101 proposed an intimate relationship with Him, and as a k\u1e63atriya He should have satisfied her. But He was so henpecked that He could not forget S\u012bt\u0101dev\u012b and converted \u015a\u016brpa\u1e47akh\u0101 into an ugly woman. Before that birth as a k\u1e63atriya, He took birth as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a boy known as V\u0101manadeva and asked charity from Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was so magnanimous that he gave Him whatever he had, yet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as V\u0101manadeva ungratefully arrested him just like a crow and pushed him down to the P\u0101t\u0101la kingdom. We know all about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and how ungrateful He is. But here is the difficulty: in spite of His being so cruel and hardhearted, it is very difficult for us to give up talking about Him.\u2019\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b points out that this speech of R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s is called avajalpa, as described by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in the following verse from the Ujjvala-n\u012blama\u1e47i (14.192): \u201cSaintly persons have concluded that when a lover, impelled by jealousy and fear, declares that Lord Hari is unworthy of her attachment because of His harshness, lustiness and dishonesty, such speech is called avajalpa.\u201d"

For those who relish just a single drop of that nectar, even once, their dedication to material duality is ruined. Many such persons have suddenly given up their wretched homes and families and, themselves becoming wretched, traveled here to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to wander about like birds, begging for their living.",
        "purport": " Material duality is based on falsely thinking, \u201cThis is mine, and that is yours,\u201d or \u201cThis is our country, and that is yours,\u201d or \u201cThis is my family, and that is yours,\u201d and so on. In fact, there is one Absolute Truth, in which we all exist and to whom everything belongs. His beauty and pleasure are also absolute and infinite, and if one actually hears about this Absolute Truth, called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one\u2019s dedication to the illusion of mundane duality is spoiled. According to the \u0101c\u0101ryas, and certainly in accord with Sanskrit grammar, the last two words of the second line of this text may also be divided dharma-avina\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25. Then the entire line becomes part of a single compound, the meaning of which is that hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cleanses one of irreligious duality and thus one is not vanquished (avina\u1e63\u1e6da) by material illusion. The word d\u012bn\u0101\u1e25 is then given the alternate reading of dh\u012br\u0101\u1e25, meaning that one becomes spiritually sober and thus gives up attachment to fleeting material relationships. The word viha\u1e45g\u0101\u1e25, \u201cbirds,\u201d would in this case refer to swans, the symbol of essential discrimination. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b quotes R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as follows in connection with this verse: \u201cWhen a lover indirectly states with remorse that her beloved is fit to be given up, such speech, uttered like the plaintive crying of a bird, is called abhijalpa.\u201d (Ujjvala-n\u012blama\u1e47i 14.194)"

She was in full mourning due to separation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and felt ecstasy by talking with the bee. But as soon as the bee disappeared, She became almost mad, thinking that the messenger-bee might have returned to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to inform Him all about Her talking against Him. \u2018K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must be very sorry to hear it,\u2019 She thought. In this way She was overwhelmed by another type of ecstasy. \u201cIn the meantime, the bee, flying hither and thither, appeared before Her again. She thought, \u2018K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is still kind to Me. In spite of the messenger\u2019s carrying disruptive messages, He is so kind that He has again sent the bee to take Me to Him.\u2019 \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b was very careful this time not to say anything against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b explains that the goddess of fortune, \u015ar\u012b, has the power to assume many different forms. Thus when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enjoys other women, she stays on His chest in the form of a golden line. When He is not consorting with other women, she puts aside this form and gives Him pleasure in Her naturally beautiful form of a young woman. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, this statement of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s expresses pratijalpa, as described by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: \u201cWhen the lover humbly states that although she is unworthy of attaining her beloved she cannot give up hoping for a conjugal relationship with Him, such words, spoken with respect for her beloved\u2019s message, are called pratijalpa.\u201d (Ujjvala-n\u012blama\u1e47i 14.198) Here \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b has given up Her harsh feelings and humbly acknowledges the greatness of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

O great soul! Does He ever talk about us, His maidservants? When will He lay on our heads His aguru-scented hand?",
        "purport": " The translation and word meanings for this verse are taken from \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da\u2019s Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 6.68). \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b writes very poetically, with deep spiritual insight, about the emotions expressed in this and the previous nine verses. He interprets R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b\u2019s feelings as follows: \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b thought, \u201cSince K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was once satisfied in Vraja but left for Mathur\u0101 City, won\u2019t He also develop a desire to leave that place and go somewhere else? Mathur\u0101 is so close to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana that it\u2019s possible He may even come back here. \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the son of a respectable gentleman, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, so He must be staying in Mathur\u0101 because of His sense of obligation to His father, who authorized His going there. On the other hand, while Nanda\u2019s whole life is dedicated exclusively to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Nanda is so innocent that he allowed himself to be tricked by the Yadus, who brought K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Mathur\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must be thinking, \u2018Alas, alas! Since even My father could not bring Me back to Vraja, what can I do to return there?\u2019 Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must be impatient to come back here, and so He has sent you, a messenger. \u201cIt is only because Nanda is so innocent that he allowed his son to leave. If Nanda had allowed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mother, the queen of Vraja, to do so, she would have climbed onto Akr\u016bra\u2019s chariot and, holding her son by the neck, gone off to Mathur\u0101 with Him, followed by all the gop\u012bs. But this was not possible. \u201cEver since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a left, Nanda has been stunned by separation from Him, and Nanda\u2019s treasury rooms, storehouses, kitchens, sleeping quarters, opulent houses and so on are now vacant. Unswept and uncleansed, they are littered with grass, dust, leaves and cobwebs. Does K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ever remember His father\u2019s houses? And does He sometimes remember Subala and His other friends, who are now lying stunned in other neglected houses? \u201cThe women in Mathur\u0101 who now associate with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot know how to serve Him in the way that pleases Him most. When they see He is not satisfied and ask how they can make Him happy, does He tell them about us gop\u012bs? \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must tell them, \u2018You city ladies cannot please Me as much as the gop\u012bs of Vraja. They are most expert in stringing flower garlands, perfuming their bodies with ointments, playing various rhythms and melodies on stringed instruments, dancing and singing in the r\u0101sa performance, displaying their beauty, charm and cleverness, and skillfully playing at questions and answers. They are especially expert in the pastimes of meeting one\u2019s lover and showing jealous anger and other signs of pure love and affection.\u2019 Surely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must know this. Therefore He\u2019ll probably tell the women of Mathur\u0101, \u2018My dear women of the Yadu clan, please go back to your families. I no longer desire to associate with you. In fact, I\u2019m going back to Vraja early tomorrow morning.\u2019 \u201cWhen will K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speak like this and come back here to place His hand, fragrant with aguru, on our heads? Then He will console us, saying, \u2018O beloveds of My heart, I swear to you that I will never abandon you again and go elsewhere. Indeed, I have not been able to find anyone in all the three worlds with even a trace of your good qualities.\u2019\u201d Thus \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b interprets the feelings of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. The \u0101c\u0101rya further explains that the present text displays the speech called sujalpa, as described by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: \u201cWhen, out of honest sincerity, a lover questions \u015ar\u012b Hari with gravity, humility, unsteadiness and eagerness, such speech is known as sujalpa.\u201d (Ujjvala-n\u012blama\u1e47i 14.200) Concluding this section of Chapter Forty-seven, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b explains that there are ten divisions of divine madness (divyonm\u0101da), which are expressed by the ten divisions of citra-jalpa, or variegated speech. Such divine madness is shown in the special pastime of bewilderment, which is itself part of the supreme bliss, mah\u0101-bh\u0101va, of \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b. The \u0101c\u0101rya quotes the following verses from R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s Ujjvala-n\u012blama\u1e47i (14.174, 178-80) to explain these ecstasies: \u201cIt is virtually only within the princess of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana [\u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b] that the ecstasy of bewilderment arises. She has attained to a special stage of this bewilderment, a wonderful state that resembles delusion. Known as divyonm\u0101da, it has many aspects, which come and go unsteadily, and one of these manifestations is citra-jalpa. This talk, induced by Her seeing Her beloved\u2019s friend, is filled with covered anger and comprises many different ecstasies. It culminates in Her intense, anxious eagerness. \u201cThis citra-jalpa has ten divisions, known as prajalpa, parijalpa, vijalpa, ujjalpa, sa\u00f1jalpa, avajalpa, abhijalpa, \u0101jalpa, pratijalpa and sujalpa.\u201d Finally, some authorities say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, eager to drink the sweetness of His beloved\u2019s speech, assumed the form of the messenger bee."

Just as the elements of nature \u2014 ether, air, fire, water and earth \u2014 are present in every created thing, so I am present within everyone\u2019s mind, life air and senses, and also within the physical elements and the modes of material nature.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, the apparently philosophical language of the Lord\u2019s statement conceals a deeper meaning. The Supreme Lord was secretly telling the gop\u012bs that He, by way of reciprocating their special love for Him, was present with them, not only as the Soul of all creation but also as their special lover. In this sense of the verse, the word gu\u1e47a indicates the gop\u012bs\u2019 special divine qualities, which attracted \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the word sarv\u0101tman\u0101, which we have here translated in reference to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself (corresponding to the word me, which is also in the instrumental case), is also understood in the sense of sarvath\u0101, or \u201ccompletely.\u201d In other words, although in one sense Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was absent, He could never be completely absent, since in His spiritual form He is always in the hearts and minds of the gop\u012bs. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and other books, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has elaborately explained that the reason Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a separated Himself from the gop\u012bs was to intensify their love for Him and, as Uddhava noted, to bless other devotees by revealing to them the intensity of the gop\u012bs\u2019 love. In fact, the Lord was spiritually present with the gop\u012bs, since they are His eternal associates. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b further points out that foolish persons will conclude that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s use of philosophical language meant that the Lord was trying to bring the gop\u012bs to the point of liberation by explaining basic points of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious philosophy. In truth, the gop\u012bs are the most exalted liberated souls, and their pastimes with \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must be understood with the help of authorized \u0101c\u0101ryas. When the gop\u012bs came for the r\u0101sa dance, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tried to preach karma-yoga to them, emphasizing ordinary ethics and morality, but the gop\u012bs were beyond that. Similarly, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a now offers them j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, or metaphysical philosophy, but this is also inadequate for the gop\u012bs, who have achieved spontaneous, unalloyed love for \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here assures the gop\u012bs that by fixing their minds in self-realization, they will realize their spiritual oneness with the Lord. Thus they will no longer suffer the pangs of separation."

Leave V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, and then you won\u2019t have to see these rivers, mountains and forests. Cover your eyes with your garments, use your intelligence to lead your minds to some other thought, and thus forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d The gop\u012bs answer this suggestion in the previous verse by stating, \u201cWe no longer possess our intelligence, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has taken it away by His supreme beauty and charm.\u201d Now in the present verse the feelings of the gop\u012bs become so strong that they disregard Uddhava and, turning toward Mathur\u0101, address K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself with humble cries. They address K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Vrajan\u0101tha because in the past young K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a performed many inconceivable pastimes to protect His beloved village people, such as lifting Govardhana Hill and destroying many monstrous demons. In this heartrending verse, the gop\u012bs cry out to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to remember the wonderful, sweet relationship they once enjoyed together as innocent village people. Indeed, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would lovingly take care of His father\u2019s cows, and the gop\u012bs appealed to Him to remember these duties and return so He could resume them."

In this regard \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b describes three types of adulterous women. The first is a woman who enjoys both her husband and a lover, being faithful to neither. Both ordinary society and the scriptures condemn this conduct. The second type of adulterous woman is she who abandons her husband to enjoy only with her lover. Society and the scriptures also condemn this behavior, although such a fallen woman may be said to at least have the good quality of dedicating herself to a single man. The last kind of adulterous woman is she who abandons her husband and enjoys in the attitude of being a lover of the Supreme Lord alone. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b explains that although foolish, common people criticize this position, such behavior is commended by those who are wise in spiritual science. Therefore learned members of society and the revealed scriptures praise such single-minded devotion to the Lord. Such was the gop\u012bs\u2019 behavior. Thus the term vyabhic\u0101ra-du\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25, \u201ccorrupted by deviation,\u201d indicates the apparent resemblance between the gop\u012bs\u2019 behavior and that of ordinary adulterous women."

        "purport": " The word meanings and translation for this verse are taken from \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da\u2019s English rendering of Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Antya 7.47). \u015ar\u012b Uddhava here shows the perfect Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava attitude of humility. He does not pray to be equal to the gop\u012bs in their exalted stage of love, but rather to take birth as a bush or creeper in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana so that when they walk upon him he will get the dust of their feet and thus be blessed. The shy gop\u012bs would never agree to give such blessings to a great personality like Uddhava; therefore he cleverly sought to get such mercy by taking birth as a plant in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana."
