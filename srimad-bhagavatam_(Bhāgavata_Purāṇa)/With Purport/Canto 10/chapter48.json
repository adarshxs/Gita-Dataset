        "purport": " It is clear from the commentaries of the \u0101c\u0101ryas that the story of Trivakr\u0101 is to be understood on two levels. On the one hand, she is understood to be a liberated soul, directly associating with the Lord and participating in His pastimes. On the other hand, her conduct is clearly meant to teach a lesson about what not to do in relation with Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Since all of the Lord\u2019s pastimes are not only blissful but also didactic, there is no real contradiction in this pastime, since Trivakr\u0101\u2019s purity and her bad example take place on two distinct levels. Arjuna is also considered a pure devotee, yet by initially disobeying K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instruction to fight, he also showed an example of what not to do. However, such \u201cbad examples\u201d always have happy endings in the blissful association of the Absolute Truth, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

Throughout the Bh\u0101gavatam and other authorized Vedic literature, we often find descriptions of the Lord\u2019s simultaneous supremacy over all other things and His identity with them. We cannot reasonably draw any other conclusion from Vedic literature than the one powerfully preached by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva. That is, the Absolute Truth is greater than and distinct from everything (since He is the omnipotent creator and controller of all), and simultaneously one with everything (since all that exists is the expansion of His own power). Throughout these chapters of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, we also observe one of the unique, extraordinary features of this great work. Whether K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sending His message to the gop\u012bs or accepting the prayers of Akr\u016bra, there is constant philosophical discussion. Throughout the Bh\u0101gavatam, the steady combination of fascinating pastimes with persistent spiritual philosophy is an extraordinary feature. We are allowed to glimpse and even to relish the spiritual emotions of the Lord and His liberated associates, and yet we are constantly reminded of their ontological position lest we lapse into a cheap, anthropomorphic vision. Thus it is entirely in character with the work that Akr\u016bra, in his ecstasy, glorifies the Lord with precise philosophical prayers."

        "purport": " Here Akr\u016bra states two reasons why the Lord appears to be covered by a material form, or to take birth like a human being. First, when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a executes His pastimes, His loving devotees think of Him as their beloved child, friend, lover and so on. In the ecstasy of this loving reciprocation, they do not think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as God. For example, because of her extraordinary love for Him, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 worries that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be injured in the forest. That she feels this way is the desire of the Lord, which is here indicated by the word nik\u0101ma\u1e25. The second reason the Lord may appear material is indicated by the word aviveka\u1e25: Simply because of ignorance, a lack of discrimination, one may misunderstand the position of the Personality of Godhead. In the Eleventh Canto of the Bh\u0101gavatam, in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s discussion with \u015ar\u012b Uddhava, the Lord elaborately discusses His transcendental position beyond bondage and liberation. As stated in Vedic literature, deha-dehi-vibhago ya\u1e41 ne\u015bvare vidyate kvacit: \u201cThere is never a distinction of body and soul in the Supreme Lord.\u201d In other words, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is eternal, spiritual, omniscient and the reservoir of all pleasure."

Even in this world, an excess of love may sometimes produce unnecessary solicitude.

A grown child may be wealthy, competent and healthy, and yet the mother\u2019s loving concern continues. Similarly, a pure devotee always feels loving concern for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as exemplified by mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, who could only think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as her beautiful son. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had promised Akr\u016bra that after killing Ka\u1e41sa He would visit his home, and now the Lord kept His promise. Akr\u016bra recognizes this and glorifies the Lord as \u1e5bta-gira\u1e25, \u201cone who is true to His word.\u201d The Lord is k\u1e5bta-j\u00f1a, grateful for whatever little worship a devotee offers, and even if the devotee forgets, the Lord does not."
