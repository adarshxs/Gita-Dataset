O son of the king of the cowherds, Your transcendental body is dark blue like a new cloud, Your garment is brilliant like lightning, and the beauty of Your face is enhanced by Your gu\u00f1j\u0101 earrings and the peacock feather on Your head. Wearing garlands of various forest flowers and leaves, and equipped with a herding stick, a buffalo horn and a flute, You stand beautifully with a morsel of food in Your hand.",
        "purport": " In the previous chapter Brahm\u0101, the creator of the universe, tried to bewilder the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by stealing His cowherd boyfriends and calves. But by a slight exhibition of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s own mystic potency, Brahm\u0101 himself was completely bewildered, and now with great humility and devotion he offers his humble obeisances and prayers unto the Lord. The word kavala in this verse refers to a morsel of rice mixed with yogurt that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a held in His left hand. According to San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the Lord held a cowherding stick and a buffalo horn pressed under His left arm, and His flute was placed under His belt. Beautiful young K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, decorated with multicolored forest minerals, exhibited opulences far greater than those of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Although Brahm\u0101 had seen innumerable four-armed forms of the Lord, he now surrendered unto the lotus feet of the two-armed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who appeared as the son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Brahm\u0101 offered his prayers to that form."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, neither I nor anyone else can estimate the potency of this transcendental body of Yours, which has shown such mercy to me and which appears just to fulfill the desires of Your pure devotees. Although my mind is completely withdrawn from material affairs, I cannot understand Your personal form. How, then, could I possibly understand the happiness You experience within Yourself?",
        "purport": " In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Chapter Fourteen, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da explains that in the present verse Lord Brahm\u0101 expressed the following prayerful sentiment: \u201cYour appearance as a cowherd child is for the benefit of the devotees, and although I have committed an offense at Your lotus feet by stealing away Your boys and calves, I can understand that You have bestowed Your mercy upon me. That is Your transcendental quality: You are very affectionate toward Your devotees. But in spite of Your great affection for me, I cannot estimate the potency of Your bodily activities. It is to be understood that when I, Lord Brahm\u0101, the supreme personality of this universe, cannot estimate the childlike body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then what to speak of others? And if I cannot estimate the spiritual potency of Your childlike body, then what can I understand about Your transcendental pastimes? Therefore, as it is said in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, anyone who can understand a little of the transcendental pastimes, appearance and disappearance of the Lord immediately becomes eligible to enter the kingdom of God after quitting the material body. This statement is confirmed in the Vedas, where it is stated simply: By understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can overcome the chain of repeated birth and death. I therefore recommend that people should not try to understand You by their speculative knowledge.\u201d When Brahm\u0101 disrespected the supreme status of the Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first bewildered him by exhibiting the Lord\u2019s own transcendental power. Then, having humbled His devotee Brahm\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave him His personal audience. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental body can also function through the agency of His plenary expansions, called vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva. As stated by Brahm\u0101 himself in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.32): a\u1e45g\u0101ni yasya sakalendriya-v\u1e5bttimanti. This verse indicates not only that the Lord can perform any bodily function with any of His limbs but also that He can see through the eyes of His Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions or, indeed, through the eyes of any living entity, and similarly that He can hear through the ears of any Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or j\u012bva expansion. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura points out that although the Lord can perform any function with any one of His senses, in His transcendental pastimes as \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a He generally sees with His eyes, touches with His hands, hears with His ears and so on. Thus He behaves like the most beautiful and charming young cowherd boy. The Vedic knowledge expands from Lord Brahm\u0101, who is described in the first verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as \u0101di-kavi, the primeval Vedic scholar. Yet Brahm\u0101 could not understand the transcendental body of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because it is beyond the reach of ordinary Vedic knowledge. Among all the transcendental forms of the Lord, the two-armed form of Govinda \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 is original and supreme. Thus Lord Govinda\u2019s pastimes of stealing butter, drinking the gop\u012bs\u2019 breast milk, tending the calves, playing His flute and playing childhood sports are extraordinary even in comparison with the activities of the Lord\u2019s Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions."

        "purport": " Here the word udap\u0101sya clearly indicates that one should not even slightly endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by the process of mental speculation, for it invariably carries one to an imperfect, impersonal understanding of God. The word j\u012bvanti indicates that a devotee who always hears about Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will go back home, back to Godhead, even if he can do nothing except maintain his existence and hear topics concerning the Lord. \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b has explained the words tanu-v\u0101\u1e45-manobhi\u1e25 (\u201cby the body, words and mind\u201d) in three ways. In reference to devotees, through their body, words and mind they are able to conquer Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus becoming perfect in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, they can touch His lotus feet with their hands, call Him to come with their words, and attain His direct audience within their mind simply by thinking about Him. In the case of nondevotees, the words tanu-v\u0101\u1e45-manobhi\u1e25 refer to the word ajita, \u201cunconquered,\u201d and indicate that those not engaged in the loving service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot conquer the Absolute Truth by their bodily strength, verbal expertise or mental power. Despite all their endeavors, the ultimate truth remains beyond their reach. In reference to the word jita\u1e25, \u201cconquered,\u201d the words tanu-v\u0101\u1e45-manobhi\u1e25 indicate that the pure devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conquer His body, words and mind. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is conquered because He always remains by the side of His pure devotees; Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s words are conquered because He always chants the glories of His devotees; and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mind is conquered because He always thinks about His loving devotees. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has explained the words tanu-v\u0101\u1e45-manobhi\u1e25 in regard to the word namanta\u1e25, \u201coffering obeisances.\u201d He explains that the devotees can take full advantage of the transcendental topics of the Lord by offering all respects to those topics with their body, words and mind. One should engage his body by touching the ground with his hands and head while offering obeisances to the topics of the Lord; one should engage his words by praising transcendental literatures such as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, as well as the devotees who are preaching such literatures; and one should engage his mind by feeling great reverence and pleasure while hearing the transcendental topics of the Lord. In this way, a sincere devotee who has acquired even a small amount of transcendental knowledge about Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can conquer Him and thus go back home, back to Godhead, for eternal life at the Lord\u2019s side."

If someone gives up that path and engages in the cultivation of speculative knowledge, he will simply undergo a troublesome process and will not achieve his desired result. As a person who beats an empty husk of wheat cannot get grain, one who simply speculates cannot achieve self-realization. His only gain is trouble.",
        "purport": " Loving service to the Supreme Person is the natural and eternal function of every living entity. If a person renounces his own constitutional function and instead laboriously seeks so-called enlightenment through impersonal, speculative knowledge, his result is simply the trouble and bother that come from following an artificial process. A fool may beat an empty husk, not knowing that the grain has already been removed. Similarly foolish is the person who throws his mind again and again into the pursuit of knowledge without surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is the very substance and goal of knowledge, just as grain is the substance and goal of the entire agricultural effort. Vedic knowledge or, indeed, material science without the Personality of Godhead is exactly like an empty and useless husk of wheat. One may argue that by practicing yoga or cultivating impersonal knowledge one can acquire prestige, wealth, mystic powers or even impersonal liberation. But these so-called gains are actually useless, because they do not situate the living being in his constitutional position of loving service to the Supreme Lord. Therefore such results, being superfluous to the living being\u2019s essential nature, are impermanent. As stated in the N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a, patre\u1e63u pu\u1e63pe\u1e63u phale\u1e63u toye\u1e63v akr\u012bta-labhye\u1e63u vadaiva satsu/ bhakty\u0101 su-labhye puru\u1e63e pur\u0101\u1e47e muktyai kim artha\u1e41 kriyate prayatna\u1e25: \u201cSince the primeval Personality of Godhead is easily attained by offering Him such things as leaves, flowers, fruits and water, which are all found without difficulty, why does one need to endeavor for liberation separately?\u201d Although the process of devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very simple, it is extremely difficult for stubborn conditioned souls to completely humble themselves before the Supreme Personality of Godhead and absorb themselves twenty-four hours a day in His loving service. The mood of loving service is anathema to belligerent conditioned souls determined to defy God and enjoy. When such stubborn conditioned souls attempt to bypass surrendering to God through proud attempts at philosophical speculation, austerity, and yoga, they are turned back to the material platform by the powerful laws of God and violently merged into the heaving ocean of insignificance called the material world."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental existence is beyond the qualities of material nature. Thus here the Lord is referred to as agu\u1e47asya, without material qualities. Even by practicing yoga or engaging in advanced philosophical speculation, one will find it very difficult to understand clearly the transcendental existence beyond the modes of material nature. And these processes are virtually useless for understanding the Lord\u2019s own unlimited transcendental qualities, which are far beyond the impersonal conception of spiritual existence. Only by the mercy of the pure devotees of the Lord or by associating with the Lord Himself can one begin the process of realizing the personal feature of God \u2014 a process that culminates in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the final and supreme perfection of knowledge."

But among these learned men, who could possibly count the unlimited transcendental qualities possessed by You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have descended onto the surface of the earth for the benefit of all living entities?",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b explains that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is gu\u1e47\u0101tm\u0101, \u201cthe soul of all superior qualities,\u201d because He gives them life. For example, one may discuss in an abstract way such qualities as generosity, intelligence and mercy, but they come to life only when a living person exhibits them. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is gu\u1e47\u0101tm\u0101 because He descends to the material world and reestablishes religious principles by exhibiting all godly qualities Himself and inspiring them in others. A living entity who develops the transcendental qualities found in the Lord receives immeasurable benefit and eventually goes with the Lord back to His own abode, where all living beings are liberated and fully endowed with the transcendental nature. \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b further explains that the Lord manifests a specific spiritual quality for the benefit of each living entity. Since there are innumerable living entities within the confines of the material creation, the Lord manifests infinite qualities. Thus every conditioned soul can appreciate the Supreme Lord in a particular way. The example is given here that even if the most learned scholars could someday count the particles of earth, snow and light, they would still fail to understand the qualities of the Lord. In this example earth, snow and light are progressively more subtle; thus it is to be understood that there is an increasing difficulty in counting their virtually infinite particles. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, great personalities like Lord Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a actually have counted the number of atoms on the earth, and even the molecules in the entire universe. Yet even such a personality as Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, who has been continuously chanting the glories of the Lord since time immemorial, has not even approached a final count of those glories. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibits His most astonishing qualities during His childhood pastimes in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where He steals butter from the cowherd ladies, dances with His girlfriends, and plays with His cowherd boyfriends as their most dear companion. Although appearing like ordinary human activities, such sublime pastimes embody Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s immeasurable and innumerable beautiful transcendental qualities, which are the life and soul of the pure devotees."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, one who earnestly waits for You to bestow Your causeless mercy upon him, all the while patiently suffering the reactions of his past misdeeds and offering You respectful obeisances with his heart, words and body, is surely eligible for liberation, for it has become his rightful claim.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b explains in his commentary that just as a legitimate son has to simply remain alive to gain an inheritance from his father, one who simply remains alive in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, following the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, automatically becomes eligible to receive the mercy of the Personality of Godhead. In other words, he will be promoted to the kingdom of God. The word su-sam\u012bk\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47a indicates that a devotee earnestly awaits the mercy of the Supreme Lord even while suffering the painful effects of previous sinful activities. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that a devotee who fully surrenders unto Him is no longer liable to suffer the reactions of his previous karma. However, because in his mind a devotee may still maintain the remnants of his previous sinful mentality, the Lord removes the last vestiges of the enjoying spirit by giving His devotee punishments that may sometimes resemble sinful reactions. The purpose of the entire creation of God is to rectify the living entity\u2019s tendency to enjoy without the Lord, and therefore the particular punishment given for a sinful activity is specifically designed to curtail the mentality that produced the activity. Although a devotee has surrendered to the Lord\u2019s devotional service, until he is completely perfect in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness he may maintain a slight inclination to enjoy the false happiness of this world. The Lord therefore creates a particular situation to eradicate this remaining enjoying spirit. This unhappiness suffered by a sincere devotee is not technically a karmic reaction; it is rather the Lord\u2019s special mercy for inducing His devotee to completely let go of the material world and return home, back to Godhead. A sincere devotee earnestly desires to go back to the Lord\u2019s abode. Therefore he willingly accepts the Lord\u2019s merciful punishment and continues offering respects and obeisances to the Lord with his heart, words and body. Such a bona fide servant of the Lord, considering all hardship a small price to pay for gaining the personal association of the Lord, certainly becomes a legitimate son of God, as indicated here by the words d\u0101ya-bh\u0101k. Just as one cannot approach the sun without becoming fire, one cannot approach the supreme pure, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without undergoing a rigid purificatory process, which may appear like suffering but which is in fact a curative treatment administered by the personal hand of the Lord."

Indeed, if one of the small sparks were to try to burn the original fire, the attempt would be simply ludicrous. Similarly, even the creator of the entire universe, Lord Brahm\u0101, is an insignificant spark of the potency of God, and therefore Brahm\u0101\u2019s attempt to bewilder the Supreme Lord was certainly ludicrous. Brahm\u0101 here addresses Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as \u012b\u015ba, which indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not only the supreme master of everyone but is also specifically the master of Brahm\u0101, who creates the universe directly under the guidance of the Lord and who, indeed, is born directly from the Lord\u2019s own body. Brahm\u0101 felt ashamed of his impudent attempt at deluding Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he was therefore perfectly willing to be punished or forgiven by the Lord, according to His decision. If Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not mercifully punish His devotees when they act improperly, their foolishness will simply increase and gradually completely overwhelm their devotional sentiments. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a kindly disciplines His devotees and maintains them on the progressive path back home, back to Godhead."

Generally, everyone\u2019s personal bodily measurement is calculated to be seven spans of his hand. This particular universe may appear to be a very gigantic body, but it is nothing but the measurement of seven spans for Lord Brahm\u0101. \u201cAside from this universe, there are unlimited other universes outside the jurisdiction of this particular Lord Brahm\u0101. Just as innumerable atomic infinitesimal fragments pass through the holes of a screened window, so millions and trillions of universes in their seedling form are coming out from the bodily pores of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and that Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is but a part of the plenary expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Under these circumstances, although Lord Brahm\u0101 is the supreme creature within this universe, what is his importance in the presence of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a?\u201d"

Brahm\u0101 had tried to test Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to see if He was really the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing as a cowherd boy. Brahm\u0101 stole all the other boys and their calves from the pasturing grounds, but when he returned to the pastures he saw that all the boys and calves were still there, for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had created them all again. When Brahm\u0101 saw this mystic power of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, he admitted defeat and offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the proprietor and seer of everything in the creation and as the Supersoul who is within each and every living entity and is dear to all. That Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the father of Brahm\u0101, because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plenary expansion Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, after placing Himself on the Garbha Ocean, created Brahm\u0101 from His own body. Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in the Causal Ocean and K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart, are also transcendental expansions of the Supreme Truth.\u201d In his commentary on this verse, \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b has elaborately explained the expansion of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, incarnations from the original form of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The essence is that although Lord Brahm\u0101 was born from Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Brahm\u0101 now understands that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is Himself a mere expansion of the original Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

As described in the Second Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Lord Brahm\u0101 took birth on the seat of a giant lotus whose stem emanated from the navel of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Brahm\u0101 was bewildered as to his whereabouts, function and identity, and therefore he tried to trace out the source of the lotus stem, searching for clear information. Unable to find the Personality of Godhead, he returned to his seat and engaged in severe austerities, having been ordered to do so by the transcendental voice of the Lord, who could be heard but not seen. After long meditation, Brahm\u0101 saw the Lord but then again lost sight of Him. Thus Brahm\u0101 concludes that the transcendental body of the Personality of Godhead is not material but rather an eternal, spiritual form endowed with inconceivable mystic potencies. In other words, Lord Brahm\u0101 should not have challenged the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of all mystic power."

This does not mean, however, that the Lord is degraded by His incarnations. As Brahm\u0101 clarifies here, no conditioned soul can understand the transcendental nature of the Lord\u2019s activities, which He enacts through His spiritual potency. Although the Lord is bh\u016bman, the supremely great one, He is still Bhagav\u0101n, the supremely beautiful personality exhibiting pastimes of love in His own abode. At the same time He is Param\u0101tm\u0101, the all-pervading Supersoul, who witnesses and sanctions all the activities of conditioned souls. The Lord\u2019s multiple identity is explained by the term yoge\u015bvara. The Absolute Truth is the master of all mystic potencies, and although He is one and supreme, He manifests His greatness and opulence in many different ways. Such elevated spiritual matters can hardly be understood by foolish persons primitively identifying themselves with the insignificant material body. These conditioned souls, such as atheistic scientists, consider their own puffed-up intelligence supreme. Gullibly placing their firm faith in material illusion, they are captured by the modes of nature and driven far away from knowledge of God."

In his commentary on Vedanta-s\u016btra, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya has confirmed this by quoting the following statement from the Vedic \u015bruti-mantras: satya\u1e41 hy eveda\u1e41 vi\u015bvam as\u1e5bjata. \u201cThis universe, created by the Lord, is real.\u201d The perfect authority of the Vedas thus certifies this universe to be real; nevertheless, because our knowledge is stolen by illusion (as indicated here by the words asta-dhi\u1e63a\u1e47am), we cannot properly understand this universe or the Supreme Lord who has created it. As the expansion of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the universe is real and is meant for being engaged in His service. One who accepts the kingdom of God as home, the Lord Himself as the object of love, and the material universe as paraphernalia for being engaged in the Lord\u2019s service dwells within eternal reality wherever he may go within the material and spiritual worlds."

You are eternal and infallible, perfect and complete, without any rival and free from all material designations.

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b explains how the various terms of this verse demonstrate that the transcendental body of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is free from the characteristics of material bodies. All material bodies go through six phases: birth, growth, maturity, reproduction, decline and destruction. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not take material birth, since He is the original reality, a fact clearly indicated here by the word adya, \u201coriginal.\u201d We take our material birth within a particular material atmosphere, in material bodies that are amalgamations of various material elements. Since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a existed long before the creation of any material atmosphere or element, there is no question of material birth for His transcendental body. Similarly, the word p\u016br\u1e47a, meaning \u201cfull and complete,\u201d refutes the concept that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could grow, since He is ever-existing in fullness. When one\u2019s material body becomes mature, one can no longer enjoy as in youth; but the words ajasra-sukha, \u201cenjoying unobstructed happiness,\u201d indicate that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body never reaches so-called middle age, since it is always full of spiritual youthful bliss. The word ak\u1e63ara, \u201cundiminishing,\u201d refutes the possibility that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body grows old or declines, and the word am\u1e5bta, \u201cimmortal\u201d negates the possibility of death. In other words, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental body is free from the transformations of material bodies. The Lord does, however, create innumerable worlds and expand Himself as innumerable living entities. But the Lord\u2019s so-called reproduction is completely spiritual and does not take place at a certain phase of bodily existence; rather, it constitutes the Lord\u2019s eternal proclivity to expand His spiritual bliss and glories. As the Lord states in \u015bruti, p\u016brvam ev\u0101ham ih\u0101sam: \u201cI alone existed in the beginning.\u201d Therefore here the Lord is called puru\u1e63a\u1e25 pur\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25, \u201cthe primeval enjoyer.\u201d This original puru\u1e63a expands Himself as the Supersoul and enters every living being. Still, He is ultimately the Absolute Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as stated in the Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad: ya\u1e25 s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t para-brahmeti govinda\u1e41 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e41 v\u1e5bnd\u0101vana-sura-bh\u016bruha-tal\u0101s\u012bnam. \u201cThe Absolute Truth Himself is Govinda, who has an eternal form of bliss and knowledge and who is sitting beneath the shady desire trees of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\u201d This Absolute Truth is beyond material ignorance and beyond even ordinary spiritual knowledge, as stated in the same Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b \u015bruti: vidy\u0101vidy\u0101bhy\u0101\u1e41 bhinna\u1e25. Thus, in many ways the supremacy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has been established in the Vedic literature, and it is here confirmed by Lord Brahm\u0101 himself."

To be trapped in a world in which all things are born and die is certainly a fearful experience. Anyone trapped in a dark place naturally becomes fearful. Since material life is always covered by the darkness of ignorance, every conditioned soul is fearful. The material nature is not ultimate reality, and thus analysis of matter can never provide answers to ultimate questions. This dark, snakelike existence called material life immediately disappears as soon as one opens his eyes to the bright light of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " Material bondage is illusion because the living entity actually has no real relationship with the material world. Because of false ego, the conditioned soul identifies himself with matter. Therefore so-called liberation is simply the giving up of an illusion rather than release from actual bondage. Yet even if we think that the suffering of material illusion is real and that liberation is thus a meaningful release from suffering, the mere absence of material existence is still insignificant compared to the achievement of factual spiritual life, which is the positive eternal reality opposed to the negative illusion of material life. Ultimately, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or pure love of Godhead, is the only significant, meaningful and permanent status for every living entity. Since the darkness of night is caused by the absence of the sun, one would not experience night within the sun itself, nor would one experience individual days separated by nights. Similarly, within the pure living entity there is no material darkness and thus no experience of liberation from such darkness. When the conditioned soul comes to this platform of pure consciousness, he becomes fit to associate with the supreme pure, the Personality of Godhead Himself, in the Lord\u2019s own abode."

Discovering that we are actually an eternal soul within the body, we naturally focus our attention on that real self.

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very eager to bestow His mercy upon the conditioned living beings, who are uselessly struggling with the Lord\u2019s illusory energy, M\u0101y\u0101. The conditioned soul struggles for happiness through sense gratification and for knowledge through mental speculation. Both processes ultimately bring him to a morose and hopeless condition. If the conditioned soul surrenders to the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thus acquires even a trace of His causeless mercy, the whole situation is changed, and the living entity can begin his real life of bliss and knowledge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

The Lord\u2019s devotees achieve their exalted position by unalloyed devotion and love. One cannot achieve such spiritual opulence by any puffed-up material process of personal improvement. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da reveals the mind of Brahm\u0101 as follows: \u201cBut if I am not so fortunate to take birth within the forest of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, I beg to be allowed to take birth outside the immediate area of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana so that when the devotees go out they will walk over me. Even that would be a great fortune for me. I am just aspiring for a birth in which I will be smeared by the dust of the devotees\u2019 feet.\u201d"

However, all these activities are intensely engaged in the loving service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana perform all activities in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thus exist on the most exalted platform of liberated life. Otherwise, the same activities performed without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness constitute ordinary bondage to the material world. Thus, one should not misunderstand the exalted position of the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, nor should one consider oneself highly religious simply because one performs ordinary domestic affairs very enthusiastically, but without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. By focusing our passionate attachment on our family and society, we are completely deviated from the progressive path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Conversely, if we engage our family in the loving service of the Lord, our endeavors to maintain our family become part and parcel of our progressive spiritual duties. In conclusion, by studying the extraordinary status of the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, we can see that the essential quality of their lives is pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2014 the rendering of loving service to the Lord without a trace of material desire or mental speculation. Such loving service to the original Personality of Godhead immediately creates the atmosphere of \u015ar\u012b V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana-dh\u0101ma, the kingdom of God."

        "purport": " In his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da has quoted Lord Brahm\u0101 as follows: \u201cMy dear Lord, although You are the Supreme Lord of all creation, I sometimes falsely think that I am the master of this universe. I may be master of this universe, but there are innumerable universes, and there are also innumerable Brahm\u0101s who preside over these universes. But actually You are the master of them all. As the Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart, You know everything. Please, therefore, accept me as Your surrendered servant. I hope that You will excuse me for disturbing You in Your pastimes with Your friends and calves. Now if You will kindly allow me, I will immediately leave so You can enjoy Your friends and calves without my presence.\u201d The words sarva\u1e41 tva\u1e41 vetsi sarva-d\u1e5bk are very significant here. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows everything and sees everything, and therefore Lord Brahm\u0101 did not need to remain in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana to maintain his personal loving contact with the Lord. In fact, as the creator of the universe, Lord Brahm\u0101 was somewhat out of place in the simple, blissful atmosphere of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was exhibiting His supreme opulences in herding cows, enjoying picnics, playing games, and so on. Upon seeing the intense love the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana had for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Brahm\u0101 felt unqualified to remain there. He was not eager to give up the Lord\u2019s association, but he felt it better to return to his personal devotional service in Brahmaloka. Somewhat embarrassed and unhappy over his foolish attempt at bewildering the Lord, Brahm\u0101 preferred to resume his transcendental loving service rather than try to enjoy the Lord\u2019s presence."

You dispel the dense darkness of irreligion and oppose the demons who have appeared on this earth. O Supreme Personality of Godhead, as long as this universe exists and as long as the sun shines, I will offer my obeisances unto You.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Lord Brahm\u0101 is here engaged in the ecstasy of n\u0101ma-sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, glorifying various holy names of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that indicate His variegated pastimes. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expertly suppressed the demoniac population of the earth, which became unbearable with the advent of demoniac politicians like Ka\u1e41sa, Jar\u0101sandha and \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la. Similarly, in modern society there are many so-called God-fearing people who are actually attracted to demoniac existence. Such persons become enlivened with the setting of the sun and go out in the darkness to enjoy life in restaurants, nightclubs, discotheques, hotels and so on, which are all simply meant for illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. Then there are those who openly defy God and His laws, declaring themselves atheists and demons. Both the covert and the overt enemies of the Lord constitute an unholy burden for the earth, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends to expertly remove this burden. Here Lord Brahm\u0101 indirectly states that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should remove Brahm\u0101\u2019s own subtle atheism, which had led him to try to exert illusory power over Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, Lord Brahm\u0101, in his shame, felt himself to be like a brahma-r\u0101k\u1e63asa from Satyaloka who had come to the earth to disturb Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His intimate friends and calves. Brahm\u0101 is lamenting that although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is most exalted, the Lord of all lords, because He had appeared before Brahm\u0101 in such a simple and innocent feature \u2014 decorated with a stick, a conchshell, ornaments, red clay, a peacock feather and so on, and sporting with His cowherd boyfriends \u2014 Brahm\u0101 dared to challenge Him. Concerning Brahm\u0101\u2019s prayers, of which this verse is the conclusion, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura states, \u201cMay these prayers of Brahm\u0101, which take away all doubts and broadcast all the definitive conclusions of devotional service, become the expert craftsmanship of the foundation of my consciousness.\u201d"

        "translation": "After granting His son Brahm\u0101 permission to leave, the Supreme Personality of Godhead took the calves, who were still where they had been a year earlier, and brought them to the riverbank, where He had been taking His meal and where His cowherd boyfriends remained just as before.",
        "purport": " The word sva-bhuvam, \u201cto His own son,\u201d indicates that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a forgave the offense Brahm\u0101 had committed and treated him with affection, as His son. It is stated in this verse that the original cowherd boyfriends and calves were situated just as before: near the bank of the Yamun\u0101 River and in the forest, respectively. Previously the calves had disappeared within the forest and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had gone to search for them. Not finding them, the Lord had returned to the riverbank to discuss the situation with His cowherd boyfriends, but they had also disappeared. Now the cows were once again in the forest and the boyfriends once again on the bank of the river, ready to take their lunch. According to \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the calves and boys remained in the forest and on the riverbank, respectively, for one full year. Lord Brahm\u0101 did not actually take them away to another place. By the Lord\u2019s omnipotent illusory energy, the gop\u012bs and other residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana did not notice the calves and boys, nor did the calves and boys notice the passing of a year\u2019s time or feel any hunger, cold or thirst. All this was part of the pastime arranged by the Lord\u2019s illusory potency. Lord Brahm\u0101 thought, \u201cI have kept all the boys and calves of Gokula sleeping on the bed of my mystic potency, and to this very day they have not risen. A similar number of boys and calves have been playing with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for one whole year, yet they are different from the ones illusioned by my mystic potency. Who are they? Where did they come from?\u201d Nothing is invisible to the Supreme Lord. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared to be searching for the calves and boys only to enact the dramatic pastime of bewildering Lord Brahm\u0101. After Brahm\u0101 surrendered and offered prayers, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a returned to the original boys and calves, who appeared exactly as before, although their size had somewhat increased because of one year\u2019s growth. According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was playing exactly like an innocent young cowherd boy in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, after four-headed Brahm\u0101 offered his prayers the Lord maintained His role as a young cowherd boy and thus remained silent before Brahm\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s silence indicates the following thoughts: \u201cWhere did this four-headed Brahm\u0101 come from? What is he doing? What are these words he keeps on speaking? I am busy looking for My calves. I am just a cowherd boy and do not understand all this.\u201d Lord Brahm\u0101 had considered Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a an ordinary cowherd boy and had treated Him as such. After accepting Brahm\u0101\u2019s prayers, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a continued to play as a cowherd boy and thus did not answer the four-headed Brahm\u0101. Rather, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was more interested in rejoining His cowherd boyfriends for the picnic lunch on the bank of the Yamun\u0101 River."

        "purport": " Sometimes modern thinkers become puzzled when they study the psychology of moral behavior. Although every living entity is inclined toward self-preservation, as stated here, sometimes a person voluntarily sacrifices his own apparent interest through philanthropic or patriotic activities, such as giving his money for the benefit of others or giving his life for the national interest. Such so-called selfless behavior appears to contradict the principle of material self-centeredness and self-preservation. As explained in this verse, however, a living entity serves his society, nation, family and so on only because these objects of affection represent the expanded concept of false ego. A patriot sees himself as a great servitor of a great nation, and thus he sacrifices his life to gratify his sense of egotism. Similarly, it is common knowledge that a man feels great pleasure by thinking that he is sacrificing everything to please his dear wife and children. A man derives great egotistic pleasure by seeing himself as a selfless well-wisher of his so-called family and community. Thus, to gratify his proud sense of false ego, a man is prepared even to lay down his life. This apparently contradictory behavior is yet another demonstration of the bewilderment of material life, which has neither rhyme nor reason, being a manifestation of gross ignorance of the nonmaterial soul."

Thus, even ordinary persons pick up the notion of self-realization, instinctively understanding that it is possible for the soul to exist in many different bodies. As the body of an intelligent person becomes old and useless, he strongly desires to live, even when he knows that his body cannot live much longer. This indicates he is gradually becoming aware that his self is more important than his body. Thus simply the desire for life can indirectly bring one to a preliminary understanding of self-realization. And in this case as well, one\u2019s basic attachment is to one\u2019s own self and not to that which supposedly belongs to oneself.

Due to the intimate relationship between the soul and the body, the body is important and dear to everyone. Similarly, the soul, being part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord, is very, very dear to all living entities. Unfortunately, the soul forgets his constitutional position and thinks he is only the body (deh\u0101tma-buddhi). Thus the soul is subjected to the rules and regulations of material nature. When a living entity, by his intelligence, reawakens his attraction for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can understand that he is not the body but part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus filled with knowledge, he no longer labors under attachment to the body and everything related to the body (janasya moho\u00a0\u2019yam aha\u1e41 mameti). Material existence, wherein one thinks,\u00a0\u2018I am the body, and this belongs to me,\u2019 is also illusory. One must redirect his attraction to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.7) states: \u2018By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.\u2019\u201d"

Still, the order of progression is always from the energetic to the expanded energy. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original identity, from whom all other identities emanate. He is the supreme energetic, from whom all categories and dimensions of energy become manifest. Thus, our personal bodies, self, family, friends, nation, planet, universe and so on are all manifestations of the Supreme Lord, who expands Himself through His personal potencies. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is certainly the supreme object of our love and attraction, and other objects, such as body, family and home, should be secondary objects of our affection. Moreover, a close analytic study of the actual situation will reveal that even the secondary objects of love are also manifestations of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The conclusion is that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is our only friend and object of love. In his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da comments on this verse as follows: \u201cWithout being an expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nothing can be attractive. Whatever is attractive within the cosmic manifestation is due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the reservoir of all pleasure. The active principle of everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and highly elevated transcendentalists see everything in connection with Him. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is stated that a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, a highly advanced devotee, sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the active principle in all moving and nonmoving living entities. Therefore he sees everything within this cosmic manifestation in relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d"

According to \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, this verse summarizes the knowledge presented in this section of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet are described as pallava, flower buds, because they are most tender and of a pinkish hue. According to \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the word pallava also indicates that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet are just like desire trees, which can fulfill all the desires of the Lord\u2019s pure devotees. Even exalted devotees like \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada, who are themselves the great shelter for the conditioned souls in this universe, personally take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus it is natural that when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a manifested Himself as all the young boys and calves of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, their parents were more attracted to them than previously. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the reservoir of all pleasure and, being all-attractive, the ultimate object of everyone\u2019s love."

        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, the word nil\u0101yanai\u1e25 refers to games such as hide-and-go-seek or cops and robbers. Sometimes the boys would jump around like the monkeys in Lord R\u0101macandra\u2019s army and then enact the building of the bridge to \u015ar\u012b La\u1e45k\u0101 by constructing play bridges in lakes or ponds. Sometimes the boys would imitate the pastime of churning the Ocean of Milk, and sometimes they would play catch with balls. We can find full pleasure in the spiritual world, with the simple condition that everything be performed in pure love of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."
