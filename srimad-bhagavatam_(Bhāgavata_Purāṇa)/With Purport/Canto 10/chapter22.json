        "translation": "Each of the young unmarried girls performed her worship while chanting the following mantra. \u201cO goddess K\u0101ty\u0101yan\u012b, O great potency of the Lord, O possessor of great mystic power and mighty controller of all, please make the son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja my husband. I offer my obeisances unto you.\u201d",
        "purport": " According to various \u0101c\u0101ryas, the goddess Durg\u0101 mentioned in this verse is not the illusory energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a called M\u0101y\u0101 but rather the internal potency of the Lord known as Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. The distinction between the internal and external, or illusory, potency of the Lord is described in the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, in the conversation between \u015aruti and Vidy\u0101: \u201cThe Lord\u2019s inferior potency, known as Durg\u0101, is dedicated to His loving service. Being the Lord\u2019s potency, this inferior energy is nondifferent from Him. There is another, superior potency, whose form is on the same spiritual level as that of God Himself. Simply by scientifically understanding this supreme potency, one can immediately achieve the Supreme Soul of all souls, who is the Lord of all lords. There is no other process to achieve Him. That supreme potency of the Lord is known as Gokule\u015bvar\u012b, the goddess of Gokula. Her nature is to be completely absorbed in love of God, and through Her one can easily obtain the primeval God, the Lord of all that be. This internal potency of the Lord has a covering potency, known as Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, who rules the material world. In fact she bewilders the entire universe, and thus everyone within the universe falsely identifies himself with the material body.\u201d From the above we can understand that the internal and external, or superior and inferior, potencies of the Supreme Lord are personified as Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 and Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101, respectively. The name Durg\u0101 is sometimes used to refer to the internal, superior potency, as stated in the Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra: \u201cIn all mantras used to worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the presiding deity is known as Durg\u0101.\u201d Thus in the transcendental sound vibrations glorifying and worshiping the Absolute Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the presiding deity of the particular mantra or hymn is called Durg\u0101. The name Durg\u0101 therefore refers also to that personality who functions as the internal potency of the Lord and who is thus on the platform of \u015buddha-sattva, pure transcendental existence. This internal potency is understood to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s sister, known also as Ek\u0101na\u1e41\u015b\u0101 or Subhadr\u0101. This is the Durg\u0101 who was worshiped by the gop\u012bs in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Several \u0101c\u0101ryas have pointed out that ordinary people are sometimes bewildered and think that the names Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101 and Durg\u0101 refer exclusively to the external potency of the Lord. Even if we accept hypothetically that the gop\u012bs were worshiping the external M\u0101y\u0101, there is no fault on their part, since in their pastimes of loving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a they were acting as ordinary members of society. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da comments in this regard: \u201cThe Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas generally do not worship any demigods. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has strictly forbidden all worship of the demigods for anyone who wants to advance in pure devotional service. Yet the gop\u012bs, who are beyond compare in their affection for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, were seen to worship Durg\u0101. The worshipers of demigods also sometimes mention that the gop\u012bs worshiped goddess Durg\u0101, but we must understand the purpose of the gop\u012bs. Generally, people worship the goddess Durg\u0101 for some material benediction. Here, the gop\u012bs prayed to the goddess to become wives of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The purport is that if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the center of activity, a devotee can adopt any means to achieve that goal. The gop\u012bs could adopt any means to satisfy or serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That was the superexcellent characteristic of the gop\u012bs. They worshiped goddess Durg\u0101 completely for one month in order to have K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as their husband. Every day they prayed for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, to become their husband.\u201d The conclusion is that a sincere devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will never imagine any material quality to exist in the transcendental gop\u012bs, who are the most exalted devotees of the Lord. The only motivation in all their activities was simply to love and satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and if we foolishly consider their activities to be mundane in any way, it will be impossible for us to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

The portion of the river where the girls and women bathe was strictly prohibited to any male, and this is still the system. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, knowing the minds of the unmarried young gop\u012bs, awarded them their desired objective. They had prayed for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to become their husband, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted to fulfill their desires.\u201d"

Although the bodily forms of the gop\u012bs were all fully developed, and although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a met them in a secluded place and brought them fully under His control, because the Lord is completely transcendental there was not a trace of material desire in His mind. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ocean of transcendental bliss, and He wanted to share His bliss with the gop\u012bs on the spiritual platform, completely free of ordinary lust. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that the companions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mentioned here were mere toddlers two or three years old.

But they still desired to successfully complete their vow, and since Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Himself the ultimate result of all pious activities, they offered their obeisances to Him to cleanse away all their sins.",
        "purport": " The transcendental position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is clearly described here. The gop\u012bs decided that it was better to renounce their so-called family tradition and traditional morality and simply surrender unto the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This does not mean that the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement advocates immoral activities. In fact, the devotees of ISKCON practice the highest standard of restraint and morality, but at the same time we recognize the transcendental position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is God and therefore has no material desire to enjoy young girls in sexual affairs. As will be seen in this chapter, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not at all attracted to enjoying the gop\u012bs; rather He was attracted to their love and wanted to satisfy them. The greatest offense is to imitate the activities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In India there is a group called pr\u0101k\u1e5bta-sahajiy\u0101, who imitate these affairs of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and try to enjoy naked young girls in the name of worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The ISKCON movement sternly rejects this mockery of religion, because the greatest offense is for a human being to ludicrously imitate the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the ISKCON movement there are no cheap incarnations, and it is not possible for a devotee of this movement to promote himself to the position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Five hundred years ago K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared as Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who practiced strict celibacy throughout His student life and at the age of twenty-four took sanny\u0101sa, a lifelong vow of celibacy. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu rigidly avoided contact with women in order to carry out His vow of loving service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally appeared five thousand years ago, He exhibited these wonderful pastimes, which attract our attention. We should not become envious or shocked when we hear that God can perform such pastimes. Our shock is due to our ignorance, because if we tried to perform these activities our bodies would be afflicted by lust. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, is the Supreme Absolute Truth and is therefore never disturbed by any material desire whatsoever. Thus, this incident \u2014 in which the gop\u012bs gave up normal standards of morality and, raising their hands to their head, bowed down in compliance with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s order \u2014 is an example of pure devotional surrender and not a discrepancy in religious principles. In fact, the gop\u012bs\u2019 surrender is the perfection of all religion, as \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da describes in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead: \u201cThe gop\u012bs were all simple souls, and whatever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said they took to be true. In order to be freed from the wrath of Varu\u1e47adeva, as well as to fulfill the desired end of their vows and ultimately to please their worshipable Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they immediately abided by His order. Thus they became the greatest lovers of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His most obedient servitors. \u201cNothing can compare with the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness of the gop\u012bs. Actually, the gop\u012bs did not care for Varu\u1e47a or any other demigod; they only wanted to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d"
