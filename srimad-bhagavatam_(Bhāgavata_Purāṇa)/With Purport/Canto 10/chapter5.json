Therefore, after bathing and purifying himself and dressing himself properly, he invited br\u0101hma\u1e47as who knew how to recite Vedic mantras. After having these qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as recite auspicious Vedic hymns, he arranged to have the Vedic birth ceremony celebrated for his newborn child according to the rules and regulations, and he also arranged for worship of the demigods and forefathers.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has discussed the significance of the words nandas tu. The word tu, he says, is not used to fulfill the sentence, because without tu the sentence is complete. Therefore the word tu is used for a different purpose. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared as the son of Devak\u012b, Devak\u012b and Vasudeva did not enjoy the j\u0101ta-karma, the festival of the birth ceremony. Instead, this ceremony was enjoyed by Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, as stated here (nandas tv \u0101tmaja utpanne j\u0101t\u0101hl\u0101do mah\u0101-man\u0101\u1e25). When Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja met Vasudeva, Vasudeva could not disclose, \u201cYour son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually my son. You are His father in a different way, spiritually.\u201d Because of fear of Ka\u1e41sa, Vasudeva could not observe the festival for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, took full advantage of this opportunity. The j\u0101ta-karma ceremony can take place when the umbilical cord, connecting the child and the placenta, is cut. However, since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was brought by Vasudeva to the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, where was the chance for this to happen? In this regard, Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura desires to prove with evidence from many \u015b\u0101stras that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a actually took birth as the son of Ya\u015bod\u0101 before the birth of Yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, who is therefore described as the Lord\u2019s younger sister. Even though there may be doubts about the cutting of the umbilical cord, and even though it is possible that this was not done, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, such events are regarded as factual. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared as Var\u0101hadeva from the nostril of Brahm\u0101, and therefore Brahm\u0101 is described as the father of Var\u0101hadeva. Also significant are the words k\u0101ray\u0101m \u0101sa vidhivat. Being overwhelmed with jubilation over the birth of his son, Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not see whether the cord was cut or not. Thus he performed the ceremony very gorgeously. According to the opinion of some authorities, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was actually born as the son of Ya\u015bod\u0101. In any case, without regard for material understandings, we can accept that Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s celebration for the ceremony of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth was proper. This ceremony is therefore well known everywhere as Nandotsava."

As described elsewhere in the Bh\u0101gavatam, during Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s time the cows were so happy that they used to muddy the pasturing ground with milk.

They were not daridra, nor were they N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Rather, they were devotees of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and by their educational qualifications they would satisfy N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Therefore, satisfying them was an indirect way of satisfying Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Mad-bhakta-p\u016bj\u0101bhyadhik\u0101 (Bh\u0101g. 11.19.21). The Lord says, \u201cWorshiping My devotees is better than worshiping Me directly.\u201d The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system is entirely meant for vi\u1e63\u1e47u-\u0101r\u0101dhana, worship of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Lord. The uncivilized man or materialistic person, however, does not know this aim of life. Na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um (Bh\u0101g. 7.5.31). One\u2019s real self-interest lies in satisfying Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Not satisfying Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u but instead attempting to become happy through material adjustments (bahir-artha-m\u0101nina\u1e25) is the wrong way for happiness. Because Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the root of everything, if Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is pleased, everyone is pleased; in particular, one\u2019s children and family members become happy in all respects. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted to see his newborn child happy. That was his purpose. Therefore he wanted to satisfy Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and to satisfy Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u it was necessary to satisfy His devotees, such as the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as, m\u0101gadhas and s\u016btas. Thus, in a roundabout way, ultimately it was Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u who was to be satisfied."
