Here they especially indicate that the reunion of the Yadus and V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is at Kuruk\u1e63etra is being narrated out of chronological sequence. \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b explains in his Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-to\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b commentary that the events of this Eighty-second Chapter occur after Lord Baladeva\u2019s visit to Vraja (Chapter 65) and before Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s R\u0101jas\u016bya sacrifice (Chapter 74). This must be so, the \u0101c\u0101rya reasons, since during the eclipse at Kuruk\u1e63etra all the Kurus, including Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a, met in friendship and happily shared the company of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. At the R\u0101jas\u016bya-yaj\u00f1a, on the other hand, Duryodhana\u2019s jealousy against the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas became irrevocably inflamed. Soon after this, Duryodhana challenged Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira and his brothers to the gambling match, in which he cheated them of their kingdom and exiled them to the forest. Right after the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas\u2019 return from exile, the great Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra took place, during which Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a were killed. So it is not logically possible for the solar eclipse at Kuruk\u1e63etra to have happened after the R\u0101jas\u016bya sacrifice."

The knowledge of the ancient astronomers went much further, however, since they understood the karmic influences of such events. Solar and lunar eclipses are generally very inauspicious, with certain rare exceptions. But just as the otherwise inauspicious Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b day becomes beneficial when used for the glorification of Lord Hari, so the time of an eclipse is also advantageous for fasting and worship. The holy pilgrimage site known as Samanta-pa\u00f1caka is located at Kuruk\u1e63etra, the \u201csacred ground of the Kurus,\u201d where the Kuru kings\u2019 predecessors performed many Vedic sacrifices. The Kurus were thus advised by learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as that this would be the best place for them to observe vows during the eclipse. Long before their time, Lord Para\u015bur\u0101ma had done penance at Kuruk\u1e63etra to atone for his killings. Samanta-pa\u00f1caka, the five ponds he dug there, were still present at the end of Dv\u0101para-yuga, as they are even today."

Although the earth\u2019s good fortune was ravaged by time, the touch of His lotus feet has revitalized her, and thus she is raining down on us the fulfillment of all our desires. The same Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u who makes one forget the goals of heaven and liberation has now entered into marital and blood relationships with you, who otherwise travel on the hellish path of family life. Indeed, in these relationships you see and touch Him directly, walk beside Him, converse with Him, and together with Him lie down to rest, sit at ease and take your meals.",
        "purport": " All Vedic mantras glorify Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; this truth is supported with elaborate evidence by learned \u0101c\u0101ryas like R\u0101m\u0101nuja, in his Ved\u0101rtha-sa\u1e45graha, and Madhva, in his \u1e5ag-veda-bh\u0101\u1e63ya. The words Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Himself speaks, such as the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, are the confidential essence of all scripture. In His manifestation as Vy\u0101sadeva, the Supreme Lord composed both the Ved\u0101nta-sutras and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and this Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata includes \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s personal statement: vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedyo/ ved\u0101nta-k\u1e5bd veda-vid eva c\u0101ham. \u201cBy all the Vedas, I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of Ved\u0101nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.\u201d (Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 15.15) When Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u appeared before Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to beg three steps of land, the Lord\u2019s second step pierced the shells of the universe. The water of the transcendental river Viraj\u0101, lying just outside the universal egg, thus seeped inside, washing Lord V\u0101mana\u2019s foot and flowing down to become the Ganges River. Because of the sanctity of its origin, the Ganges is generally considered the most holy of rivers. But even more potent is the water of the Yamun\u0101, where Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in His original form of Govinda played with His intimate companions. In these two verses the assembled kings praise the special merit of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s Yadu clan. Not only do they see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but they are also directly connected with Him by dual bonds of marital and blood relationships. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b suggests that the word bandha, beside its more obvious meaning of \u201crelation,\u201d can also be understood in the sense of \u201ccapture,\u201d expressing that the love the Yadus feel for the Lord obliges Him always to stay with them."

Also, you are behaving as if insane and blind with love for Them, showing millions of times more maternal affection than I possess. Thus you simply keep staring at us, your friends, without recognizing us. So let me bring you back to reality on the pretext of some affectionate words.\u201d Then, when Devak\u012b failed to get any response from Ya\u015bod\u0101 even after addressing her, Rohi\u1e47\u012b said, \u201cMy dear Devak\u012b, it\u2019s impossible just now to rouse her out of this ecstatic trance. We are crying in the wilderness, and her two sons are no less bound up in the ropes of affection for her than she is for Them. So let us now go outside to meet with P\u1e5bth\u0101, Draupad\u012b and the others.\u201d"

Now, seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a again after such a long separation, with their eyes they took Him into their hearts, and there they embraced Him to their full satisfaction. In this way they became totally absorbed in ecstatic meditation on Him, although those who constantly practice mystic yoga find such absorption difficult to achieve.",
        "purport": " According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, just then Lord Balar\u0101ma saw the gop\u012bs standing a short distance away. Seeing them trembling with eagerness to meet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and apparently ready to give up their lives if they could not, He tactfully decided to get up and involve Himself elsewhere. Then the gop\u012bs attained the state described in the current verse. In referring to the gop\u012bs\u2019 intolerant disrespect of Lord Brahm\u0101, \u201cthe creator of eyelids,\u201d \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b is giving vent to his own subtle jealousy of the gop\u012bs\u2019 favored position. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b offers an alternate understanding of the phrase nitya-yuj\u0101m, which may mean \u201ceven of the Lord\u2019s principal queens, who tend to be proud of their constant association with Him.\u201d In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da writes: \u201cBecause they had been separated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for so many years, the gop\u012bs, having come along with Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, felt intense ecstasy in seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one can even imagine how anxious the gop\u012bs were to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a again. As soon as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a became visible to them, they took Him inside their hearts through their eyes and embraced Him to their full satisfaction. Even though they were embracing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only mentally, they became so ecstatic and overwhelmed with joy that for the time being they completely forgot themselves. The ecstatic trance which they achieved simply by mentally embracing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is impossible to achieve even for great yog\u012bs constantly engaged in meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could understand that the gop\u012bs were rapt in ecstasy by embracing Him in their minds, and therefore, since He is present in everyone\u2019s heart, He also reciprocated the embracing from within.\u201d"

Revealing the jealous mood in which the gop\u012bs spoke these deceptively reverential words, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b gives their statements as follows: \u201cO Supreme Lord, O directly manifest Supersoul, O crest jewel of instructors in definitive knowledge, You were aware of our excessive attachment to home, property and family. Therefore You previously had Uddhava instruct us in the knowledge that dispels ignorance, and now You have done so Yourself. In this way You have purified our hearts of contamination, and as a result we understand Your pure love for us, free from any motivation other than assuring our liberation. But we are only unintelligent cowherd women; how can this knowledge remain fixed in our hearts? We cannot even meditate steadily on Your feet, the focus of realization for great souls like Lord Brahm\u0101. Please be merciful to us and somehow make it possible for us to concentrate on You, even a little. We are still suffering the reactions of our own fruitive work, so how can we meditate on You, the goal of great yog\u012bs? Such yog\u012bs are immeasurably wise, but we are mere feeble-minded women. Please do something to get us out of this deep well of material life.\u201d Pure devotees are never motivated by a desire for material elevation or spiritual liberation. And even if the Lord offers them such benedictions, the devotees often refuse to accept them. As stated by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the Eleventh Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.20.34): \u201cBecause My devotees possess saintly behavior and deep intelligence, they completely dedicate themselves to Me and do not desire anything besides Me. Indeed, even if I offer them liberation from birth and death, they do not accept it.\u201d It is quite appropriate, therefore, that the gop\u012bs respond with a trace of jealous anger to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s attempt at teaching them j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. Thus, according to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the words the gop\u012bs speak in this verse may be interpreted as follows: \u201cO sun who directly destroys the darkness of ignorance, we are scorched by the sun-rays of this philosophical knowledge. We are cakora birds who can subsist only on the moonlight radiating from Your beautiful face. Please come back to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana with us, and in this way bring us back to life.\u201d And if He says, \u201cThen come to Dv\u0101rak\u0101; there we will enjoy together,\u201d they reply that \u015ar\u012b V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is their home, and they are too attached to it for them to take up residence anywhere else. Only there, the gop\u012bs imply, can K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attract them by wearing peacock feathers in His turban and playing enchanting music with His flute. Only by His appearing again in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana can the gop\u012bs be saved, not by any other kind of meditation on Him or theoretical knowledge of the self."
