The word asa\u1e45khy\u0101ta means \u201cunlimited.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s calves were unlimited. We may speak of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, billions, trillions, tens of trillions, and so on, but when we go further to speak of numbers impossible for us to count, we are speaking of unlimited numbers. Such unlimited numbers are indicated here by the word asa\u1e45khy\u0101tai\u1e25. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is unlimited, His potency is unlimited, His cows and calves are unlimited, and His space is unlimited. Therefore He is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as Parabrahman. The word brahman means \u201cunlimited,\u201d and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Unlimited, Parabrahman. Therefore, we should not consider the statements of this verse to be mythological. They are factual, but inconceivable. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can accommodate an unlimited number of calves and an unlimited measurement of space. This is neither mythological nor false, but if we study K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s potency with our limited knowledge, that potency will never be possible to understand. Ata\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101m\u0101di na bhaved gr\u0101hyam indriyai\u1e25 (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.109). Our senses cannot perceive how He could keep an unlimited number of calves and cows and have unlimited space in which to do so. But this is answered in the B\u1e5bhad-bh\u0101gavat\u0101m\u1e5bta: \u015ar\u012b San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, in the B\u1e5bhad-bh\u0101gavat\u0101m\u1e5bta, states that since everything about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is unlimited, nothing is impossible for Him. It is in this sense that we have to understand this verse."

        "translation": "All the boys would be differently engaged. Some boys blew their flutes, and others blew bugles made of horn. Some imitated the buzzing of the bumblebees, and others imitated the voice of the cuckoo. Some boys imitated flying birds by running after the birds\u2019 shadows on the ground, some imitated the beautiful movements and attractive postures of the swans, some sat down with the ducks, sitting silently, and others imitated the dancing of the peacocks. Some boys attracted young monkeys in the trees, some jumped into the trees, imitating the monkeys, some made faces as the monkeys were accustomed to do, and others jumped from one branch to another. Some boys went to the waterfalls and crossed over the river, jumping with the frogs, and when they saw their own reflections on the water they would laugh. They would also condemn the sounds of their own echoes. In this way, all the cowherd boys used to play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the source of the Brahman effulgence for j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs desiring to merge into that effulgence, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead for devotees who have accepted eternal servitorship, and who for ordinary persons is but another ordinary child. The cowherd boys, having accumulated the results of pious activities for many lives, were able to associate in this way with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How can one explain their great fortune?",
        "purport": " As recommended by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, tasm\u0101t ken\u0101py up\u0101yena mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e nive\u015bayet (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.4). Somehow or other, whether one thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary human child, as the source of the Brahman effulgence, as the origin of Param\u0101tm\u0101, or as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should concentrate one\u2019s full attention upon the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is also the instruction of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the easiest way of directly approaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 sadyo h\u1e5bdy avarudhyate\u00a0\u2019tra k\u1e5btibhi\u1e25 \u015bu\u015br\u016b\u1e63ubhis tat-k\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101t (Bh\u0101g. 1.1.2). Diverting even a little of one\u2019s attention toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness immediately enables one to achieve the highest perfection of life. This is the purpose of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Lokasy\u0101j\u0101nato vidv\u0101\u1e41\u015b cakre s\u0101tvata-sa\u1e41hit\u0101m (Bh\u0101g. 1.7.6). The secret of success is unknown to people in general, and therefore \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva, being compassionate toward the poor souls in this material world, especially in this Age of Kali, has given us the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. \u015ar\u012bmad-bh\u0101gavata\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47am amala\u1e41 yad vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 priyam (Bh\u0101g. 12.13.18). For Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas who are somewhat advanced, or who are fully aware of the glories and potencies of the Lord, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is a beloved Vedic literature. After all, we have to change this body (tath\u0101 deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101pti\u1e25). If we do not care about Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, we do not know what the next body will be. But if one adheres to these two books \u2014 Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam \u2014 one is sure to obtain the association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the next life (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so\u00a0\u2019rjuna). Therefore, distribution of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam all over the world is a great welfare activity for theologians, philosophers, transcendentalists and yog\u012bs (yogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m), as well as for people in general.

Entering the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called s\u0101yujya-mukti, but later verses prove that Agh\u0101sura, like Dantavakra and others, received s\u0101r\u016bpya-mukti.

The explanation of how this is so may be summarized as follows. The effulgence came out from the python\u2019s body and became purified, attaining spiritual \u015buddha-sattva, freedom from material contamination, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had stayed within the serpent\u2019s body, even after the serpent\u2019s death. One may doubt that such a demon, full of mischievous activities, could attain the liberation of s\u0101r\u016bpya or s\u0101yujya, and one may be astonished about this. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that in order to drive away such doubts, He had the effulgence, the individual life of the python, wait for some time in its individuality, in the presence of all the demigods. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the full effulgence, and every living being is part and parcel of that effulgence. As proved here, the effulgence in every living being is individual. For some time, the effulgence remained outside the demon\u2019s body, individually, and did not mix with the whole effulgence, the brahmajyoti. The Brahman effulgence is not visible to material eyes, but to prove that every living being is individual, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had this individual effulgence stay outside the demon\u2019s body for some time, for everyone to see. Then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a proved that anyone killed by Him attains liberation, whether s\u0101yujya, s\u0101r\u016bpya, s\u0101m\u012bpya or whatever. But the liberation of those who are on the transcendental platform of love and affection is vimukti, special liberation. Thus the serpent first entered the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally and mixed with the Brahman effulgence. This merging is called s\u0101yujya-mukti. But from later verses we find that Agh\u0101sura attained s\u0101r\u016bpya-mukti. Text 38 explains that Agh\u0101sura attained a body exactly like that of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and the verse after that also clearly states that he attained a completely spiritual body like that of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Therefore in two or three places the Bh\u0101gavatam has confirmed that Agh\u0101sura attained s\u0101r\u016bpya-mukti. One may then argue, How is it that he mixed with the Brahman effulgence? The answer is that as Jaya and Vijaya, after three births, again attained s\u0101r\u016bpya-mukti and association with the Lord, Agh\u0101sura received a similar liberation."

The \u015b\u0101stra has concluded (nir\u016bpita\u1e25) that everyone should glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his own qualifications. If you are a singer, always glorify the Supreme Lord by singing very nicely. If you are a musician, glorify the Supreme Lord by playing musical instruments. Svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhitasya dharmasya sa\u1e41siddhir hari-to\u1e63a\u1e47am (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.13). The perfection of life is to satisfy the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, beginning from this earth up to the celestial kingdom, everyone engaged in glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The decision of all great saintly persons is that whatever qualifications one has acquired should be utilized to glorify the Supreme Lord. \u201cLearned sages have definitely concluded that the infallible purpose of the advancement of knowledge, austerity, Vedic study, sacrifice, the chanting of hymns, and charity is found in the transcendental descriptions of the qualities of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.22) This is the perfection of life. One should be trained how to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead by one\u2019s respective qualities. Education, austerity, penance or, in the modern world, business, industry, education and so on \u2014 all should be engaged in glorifying the Lord. Then everyone in the world will be happy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes, therefore, to exhibit His transcendental activities so that people may have the chance to glorify Him in every respect. To understand how to glorify the Lord is actual research work. It is not that everything should be understood without God. That is condemned. Without bhagavad-bhakti, without glorification of the Supreme Lord, whatever we have is simply a decoration of the dead body."

        "translation": "If even only once or even by force one brings the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead into one\u2019s mind, one can attain the supreme salvation by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as did Agh\u0101sura. What then is to be said of those whose hearts the Supreme Personality of Godhead enters when He appears as an incarnation, or those who always think of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the source of transcendental bliss for all living entities and by whom all illusion is completely removed?",
        "purport": " The process for receiving the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described here. Yat-p\u0101da-pa\u1e45kaja-pal\u0101\u015ba-vil\u0101sa-bhakty\u0101 (Bh\u0101g. 4.22.39). Simply by thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can attain Him very easily. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also described as having His lotus feet always within the hearts of His devotees (bhagav\u0101n bhakta-h\u1e5bdi sthita\u1e25). In the case of Agh\u0101sura, one may argue that he was not a devotee. The answer to this is that he thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for a moment with devotion. Bhakty\u0101ham ekay\u0101 gr\u0101hya\u1e25. Without devotion, one cannot think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and, conversely, whenever one thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one undoubtedly has devotion. Although Agh\u0101sura\u2019s purpose was to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for a moment Agh\u0101sura thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with devotion, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His associates wanted to sport within Agh\u0101sura\u2019s mouth. Similarly, P\u016btan\u0101 wanted to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by poisoning Him, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took her as His mother because He had accepted the milk of her breast. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t (Bg. 2.40). Especially when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears as an avat\u0101ra, anyone who thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His different incarnations (r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan), and especially in His original form as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, attains salvation. There are many instances of this, and among them is Agh\u0101sura, who attained the salvation of s\u0101r\u016bpya-mukti. Therefore the process is satata\u1e41 k\u012brtayanto m\u0101\u1e41 yatanta\u015b ca d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrat\u0101\u1e25 (Bg. 9.14). Those who are devotees always engage in glorifying K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam: when we speak of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we refer to all His avat\u0101ras, such as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Govinda, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lord Caitanya, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-Balar\u0101ma and \u015ay\u0101masundara. One who always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must attain vimukti, special salvation as the Lord\u2019s personal associate, not necessarily in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, but at least in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. This is called s\u0101r\u016bpya-mukti."

Thus Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it regretted that he had wanted to rule over the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and had therefore been cursed. He considered himself the lowest of the k\u1e63atriyas.

There was no doubt that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it had the good qualities of a k\u1e63atriya, but as a devotee he presented himself, with submissiveness and humility, as the lowest of the k\u1e63atriyas, remembering his act of wrapping a dead serpent around the neck of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. A student and disciple has the right to ask the guru about any confidential service, and it is the duty of the guru to explain these confidential matters to his disciple."
