        "translation": "The statements of the Lord\u2019s empowered servants are always true, and the acts they perform are exemplary when consistent with those statements. Therefore one who is intelligent should carry out their instructions.",
        "purport": " The word \u012b\u015bvara is usually defined in Sanskrit dictionaries as \u201clord, master, ruler,\u201d and also as \u201ccapable, potent to perform.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da often translated the word \u012b\u015bvara as \u201ccontroller,\u201d which brilliantly synthesizes the two fundamental concepts of \u012b\u015bvara, namely a master or ruler and a capable or potent person. A master may be incompetent, but a controller is a master or lord who in fact makes things happen. The parame\u015bvara, the supreme \u012b\u015bvara, the supreme controller, is of course God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the cause of all causes. Although people in general, especially in the Western countries, are not aware of the fact, powerful personalities control our universe. The modern, impersonal concept of the universe depicts an almost totally lifeless cosmos in which the earth floats meaninglessly. Thus we are left with the dubious \u201cultimate purpose\u201d of preserving and reproducing our genetic code, which has its own \u201cultimate purpose\u201d of adding another link to the meaningless chain of events by again reproducing itself. In contrast to this sterile, meaningless world concocted by ignorant materialists, the actual universe is full of life \u2014 personal life \u2014 and in fact full of God, who pervades and supports all that exists. The essence of reality is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His personal relationship with the innumerable living beings, of whom we are samples. Some of the living beings are trapped in the illusion of materialism, or identification with the material body, while others are liberated, aware of their eternal, spiritual nature. A third class comprises those progressing in self-realization from the materialistic state of ignorance to the enlightened state of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Reality is ultimately personal and divine, and therefore it is not surprising that, as the Vedic literature reveals to us, our universe and other universes are managed by great personalities, just as our city, state and country are managed by empowered personalities. When we democratically award a particular politician the right to govern, we vote for him because he has exhibited something we call \u201cleadership\u201d or \u201cability.\u201d We think, \u201cHe\u2019ll get the job done.\u201d In other words, it is only after an individual acquires the power to govern that we vote for him; our vote does not make him a leader but rather recognizes a power in him coming from some other source. Thus, as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains at the end of the Tenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, any living being exhibiting an extraordinary power, ability or authority must have been empowered by the Lord Himself or by the Lord\u2019s energy. Those directly empowered by the Lord are devoted to Him, and thus their power and influence spread goodness throughout the world, whereas those who are empowered by the Lord\u2019s illusory potency are in an indirect relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they do not directly reflect His will. Of course, they do reflect His will indirectly, since it is by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s arrangement that the laws of nature act upon ignorant living beings, gradually persuading them, through their journey of many lifetimes, to surrender to the Supreme Lord. Thus as politicians create wars, false hopes and innumerable passionate schemes for the materialistic persons who follow them, the politicians are indirectly carrying out the Lord\u2019s program of allowing the conditioned souls to experience the bitter fruit of godlessness. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has translated the word \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101m as \u201cthose who have become powerful through knowledge and austerity.\u201d As one understands the nature and will of God and makes the personal sacrifice required to achieve excellence in spiritual life, one becomes empowered by the Supreme Lord to represent His will, which one has intelligently recognized and accepted. The Supreme Personality of Godhead kindly descends to earth to show a vivid example of religious behavior. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.24), \u201cIf I did not execute standard duties, the whole world would be misled and in fact destroyed.\u201d Thus the Lord showed, in His different incarnations, how to act properly in this world. A good example is Lord R\u0101macandra, who behaved wonderfully as the son of King Da\u015baratha. But when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself descends, He also demonstrates the ultimate religious principle, namely that the Supreme Lord is beyond all other living beings and that no one can imitate His supreme position. This foremost of all religious principles \u2014 that the Lord is unique, without equal or superior \u2014 was clearly demonstrated in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s apparently immoral pastimes with the gop\u012bs. No one can imitate these activities without incurring dire consequences, as explained here by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. One who thinks that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary living being subjected to lust, or who accepts His r\u0101sa dance as admirable and tries to imitate it, will certainly be vanquished, as described in text 30 of this chapter. Finally, a distinction must be made between the Lord and His empowered servants. An empowered servant of the Lord, as in the case of Brahm\u0101, may experience a remnant of reactions to previous activities, according to the law of karma. But the Lord is eternally free from any entanglement in the laws of karma. He is on a unique platform."

The transcendence of spiritual reality above and beyond mundane physics is concisely explained in \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s Laghu-bhagavat\u0101m\u1e5bta: \u201cNothing is impossible for the Lord, His dear devotees, His transcendental abode or the time of His pastimes, for all these entities are inconceivably powerful.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b further explains that the word v\u0101sudev\u0101numodit\u0101\u1e25 indicates that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advised the gop\u012bs, \u201cTo assure the success of these pastimes, you and I should keep them secret.\u201d The word v\u0101sudeva, a name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, also indicates Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plenary expansion who acts as the presiding Deity of consciousness. When the word v\u0101sudeva is understood in this context, the word v\u0101sudev\u0101numodit\u0101\u1e25 indicates that the presiding Deity of consciousness, V\u0101sudeva, manifested embarrassment and fear of their elders within the gop\u012bs\u2019 hearts, and therefore it was only with great reluctance that the young girls returned home."

        "translation": "Anyone who faithfully hears or describes the Lord\u2019s playful affairs with the young gop\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana will attain the Lord\u2019s pure devotional service. Thus he will quickly become sober and conquer lust, the disease of the heart.",
        "purport": " The extraordinary power of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s conjugal pastimes is clearly revealed here. Qualitatively, the Lord\u2019s spiritual, loving pastimes are the diametric opposite of material, lusty affairs, so much so that simply by hearing about the Lord\u2019s pastimes a devotee conquers sex desire. By reading pornographic literature or hearing about material romance, we certainly do not conquer sex desire but rather increase our lust. But hearing or reading about the Lord\u2019s conjugal affairs has exactly the opposite effect because they are of the opposite nature, being purely spiritual. Therefore it is by the causeless mercy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that He exhibits His r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101 within this world. If we become attached to this narration, we will experience the bliss of spiritual love and thus reject the perverted reflection of that love, which is called lust. As nicely put by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.59), para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate: \u201cOnce having directly experienced the Supreme, one will not return to material pleasures.\u201d"
