When these beautiful women in the bloom of youth would play on the city\u2019s rooftops with balls and other toys, they shone like flashing lightning. The main streets of the city were always crowded with intoxicated elephants exuding mada, and also with cavalry, richly adorned infantrymen, and soldiers riding chariots brilliantly decorated with gold. Gracing the city were many gardens and parks with rows of flowering trees, where bees and birds would gather, filling all directions with their songs.",

Expanding Himself into that many forms, He enjoyed with each of His queens in her own richly furnished residence. On the grounds of these palaces were clear ponds fragrant with the pollen of blooming utpala, kahl\u0101ra, kumuda and ambhoja lotuses and filled with flocks of cooing birds. The almighty Lord would enter those ponds, and also various rivers, and enjoy sporting in the water while His wives embraced Him, leaving the red ku\u1e45kuma from their breasts smeared on His body.."

Indeed, since they were already imbued with divine love of God from the very beginning, they possessed transcendental bodies of eternity, knowledge and bliss, in which they were fully able to relish the pleasure of reciprocating with the Supreme Lord in his most intimate, sweet pastimes. Specifically, in the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, their love of God matured into the ecstasy of madness in pure love (bh\u0101vonmada), just as the gop\u012bs\u2019 love did when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a disappeared from their midst during the r\u0101sa dance. At that time the gop\u012bs experienced the full development of ecstatic madness, which they expressed in their inquiries from the various creatures of the forest and in such words as k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019ha\u1e41 pa\u015byata gatim: \u201cI am K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a! Just see how gracefully I move!\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.30.19) Similarly, the vil\u0101sa, or flourishing transformation, of the ecstatic love of Lord Dv\u0101rak\u0101dh\u012b\u015ba\u2019s principal queens has produced the prema-vaicitrya symptoms they have exhibited here."

The sweetness and intimacy Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a manifested in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana constitute a unique kind of opulence found nowhere else, even in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha.

As \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b points out, this verse sums up the Tenth Canto by mentioning five special glories of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that even His expansions, plenary portions and incarnations do not display. First, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s reputation eclipsed that of the holy Ganges when He descended into the Yadu dynasty. Previous to this, Mother Ganges was the most sacred of all t\u012brthas, being the water that had bathed Lord V\u0101manadeva\u2019s lotus feet. Another river, the Yamun\u0101, became even greater than the Ganges by contacting the dust from \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s feet in the districts of Vraja and Mathur\u0101: \u201cThe renowned Yamun\u0101 in My domain of Mathur\u0101 is hundreds of times greater than the Ganges. About this there can be no dispute, O goddess.\u201d (Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a) Second, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave liberation not only to His surrendered devotees but also to those who considered themselves His enemies. Devotees like the cowherd girls of Vraja and others attained His personal association by entering into His eternal pleasure pastimes in the spiritual world, while inimical demons killed by Him attained the s\u0101yujya-mukti of merging into His divine form. When He was present on this earth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s compassion extended to His family, friends and servants, and also to His enemies and their families, friends and servants. Great authorities like Lord Brahm\u0101 have mentioned this fact: sad-ve\u1e63\u0101d iva p\u016btan\u0101pi sa-kul\u0101 tv\u0101m eva dev\u0101pit\u0101. \u201cMy Lord, You have already given Yourself to P\u016btan\u0101 and her family members simply because she dressed herself as a devotee.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.35) Third, Goddess Lak\u1e63m\u012b, Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s constant companion, whom great demigods serve menially to win her slight favor, was unable to win the privilege of joining the intimate company of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees in Vraja. Despite her eagerness to participate in the r\u0101sa dance and other pastimes enacted by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and despite the severe austerities she underwent to achieve that end, she could not transcend her natural mood of reverence. The sweetness and intimacy Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a manifested in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana constitute a unique kind of opulence found nowhere else, even in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. As \u015ar\u012b Uddhava says: \u201cTo exhibit the strength of His spiritual potency, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a manifested a form just suitable for His humanlike pastimes in the material world. This form was wonderful even for Him and was the supreme abode of the wealth of good fortune. Its limbs were so beautiful that they increased the beauty of the ornaments worn on different parts of His body.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.2.12)"

        "purport": " From beginning to end, the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam has been exclusively dedicated to reciting the pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Mathur\u0101 and Dv\u0101rak\u0101. As \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b points out, this verse sums up the Tenth Canto by mentioning five special glories of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that even His expansions, plenary portions and incarnations do not display. First, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s reputation eclipsed that of the holy Ganges when He descended into the Yadu dynasty. Previous to this, Mother Ganges was the most sacred of all t\u012brthas, being the water that had bathed Lord V\u0101manadeva\u2019s lotus feet. Another river, the Yamun\u0101, became even greater than the Ganges by contacting the dust from \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s feet in the districts of Vraja and Mathur\u0101: \u201cThe renowned Yamun\u0101 in My domain of Mathur\u0101 is hundreds of times greater than the Ganges. About this there can be no dispute, O goddess.\u201d (Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a) Second, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave liberation not only to His surrendered devotees but also to those who considered themselves His enemies. Devotees like the cowherd girls of Vraja and others attained His personal association by entering into His eternal pleasure pastimes in the spiritual world, while inimical demons killed by Him attained the s\u0101yujya-mukti of merging into His divine form. When He was present on this earth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s compassion extended to His family, friends and servants, and also to His enemies and their families, friends and servants. Great authorities like Lord Brahm\u0101 have mentioned this fact: sad-ve\u1e63\u0101d iva p\u016btan\u0101pi sa-kul\u0101 tv\u0101m eva dev\u0101pit\u0101. \u201cMy Lord, You have already given Yourself to P\u016btan\u0101 and her family members simply because she dressed herself as a devotee.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.35) Third, Goddess Lak\u1e63m\u012b, Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s constant companion, whom great demigods serve menially to win her slight favor, was unable to win the privilege of joining the intimate company of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees in Vraja. Despite her eagerness to participate in the r\u0101sa dance and other pastimes enacted by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and despite the severe austerities she underwent to achieve that end, she could not transcend her natural mood of reverence. The sweetness and intimacy Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a manifested in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana constitute a unique kind of opulence found nowhere else, even in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. As \u015ar\u012b Uddhava says: \u201cTo exhibit the strength of His spiritual potency, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a manifested a form just suitable for His humanlike pastimes in the material world. This form was wonderful even for Him and was the supreme abode of the wealth of good fortune. Its limbs were so beautiful that they increased the beauty of the ornaments worn on different parts of His body.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.2.12) Fourth, the name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is superior to the name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and to those of all of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s other expansions. These two syllables \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63 and \u1e47a \u2014 combine together to destroy all inauspiciousness and illusion. When recited, the name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes \u015bruta-matha; that is to say, the recitation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name totally crushes (mathn\u0101ti) the excellence of all other spiritual practices described in the revealed scriptures (\u015bruta). In the words of the Brahm\u0101\u1e47da Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cBy uttering the single name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a just once, one attains the same benefit as that gained by reciting Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s thousand names three times.\u201d"

When recited, the name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes \u015bruta-matha; that is to say, the recitation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name totally crushes (mathn\u0101ti) the excellence of all other spiritual practices described in the revealed scriptures (\u015bruta). In the words of the Brahm\u0101\u1e47da Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cBy uttering the single name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a just once, one attains the same benefit as that gained by reciting Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s thousand names three times.\u201d Fifth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a solidly reinstated dharma, the bull of religion, on his four legs of compassion, austerity, cleanliness and truth. Thus dharma could once again become go-tra, the protector of the earth. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also established the religious function of Govardhana-p\u016bj\u0101 to honor His favorite hill, the cows and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. He also became the hill (gotra) Himself, assuming its form to accept the cowherds\u2019 offerings. Moreover, He cultivated the dharma, or loving nature, of Vraja\u2019s divine cowherds (gotras), whose love for Him has never been equaled."

        "translation": "The heavenly Ganges is a holy place of pilgrimage because her waters wash Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s feet. But when the Lord descended among the Yadus, His glories eclipsed the Ganges as a holy place. Both those who hated K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and those who loved Him attained eternal forms like His in the spiritual world. The unattainable and supremely self-satisfied goddess of fortune, for the sake of whose favor everyone else struggles, belongs to Him alone. His name destroys all inauspiciousness when heard or chanted. He alone has set forth the principles of the various disciplic successions of sages. What wonder is it that He, whose personal weapon is the wheel of time, relieved the burden of the earth?",
        "purport": " From beginning to end, the Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam has been exclusively dedicated to reciting the pastimes of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Mathur\u0101 and Dv\u0101rak\u0101. As \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b points out, this verse sums up the Tenth Canto by mentioning five special glories of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that even His expansions, plenary portions and incarnations do not display. First, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s reputation eclipsed that of the holy Ganges when He descended into the Yadu dynasty. Previous to this, Mother Ganges was the most sacred of all t\u012brthas, being the water that had bathed Lord V\u0101manadeva\u2019s lotus feet. Another river, the Yamun\u0101, became even greater than the Ganges by contacting the dust from \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s feet in the districts of Vraja and Mathur\u0101: \u201cThe renowned Yamun\u0101 in My domain of Mathur\u0101 is hundreds of times greater than the Ganges. About this there can be no dispute, O goddess.\u201d (Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a) Second, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave liberation not only to His surrendered devotees but also to those who considered themselves His enemies. Devotees like the cowherd girls of Vraja and others attained His personal association by entering into His eternal pleasure pastimes in the spiritual world, while inimical demons killed by Him attained the s\u0101yujya-mukti of merging into His divine form. When He was present on this earth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s compassion extended to His family, friends and servants, and also to His enemies and their families, friends and servants. Great authorities like Lord Brahm\u0101 have mentioned this fact: sad-ve\u1e63\u0101d iva p\u016btan\u0101pi sa-kul\u0101 tv\u0101m eva dev\u0101pit\u0101. \u201cMy Lord, You have already given Yourself to P\u016btan\u0101 and her family members simply because she dressed herself as a devotee.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.35) Third, Goddess Lak\u1e63m\u012b, Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s constant companion, whom great demigods serve menially to win her slight favor, was unable to win the privilege of joining the intimate company of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees in Vraja. Despite her eagerness to participate in the r\u0101sa dance and other pastimes enacted by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and despite the severe austerities she underwent to achieve that end, she could not transcend her natural mood of reverence. The sweetness and intimacy Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a manifested in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana constitute a unique kind of opulence found nowhere else, even in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. As \u015ar\u012b Uddhava says: \u201cTo exhibit the strength of His spiritual potency, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a manifested a form just suitable for His humanlike pastimes in the material world. This form was wonderful even for Him and was the supreme abode of the wealth of good fortune. Its limbs were so beautiful that they increased the beauty of the ornaments worn on different parts of His body.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 3.2.12) Fourth, the name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is superior to the name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and to those of all of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s other expansions. These two syllables \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63 and \u1e47a \u2014 combine together to destroy all inauspiciousness and illusion. When recited, the name K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes \u015bruta-matha; that is to say, the recitation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name totally crushes (mathn\u0101ti) the excellence of all other spiritual practices described in the revealed scriptures (\u015bruta). In the words of the Brahm\u0101\u1e47da Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cBy uttering the single name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a just once, one attains the same benefit as that gained by reciting Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s thousand names three times.\u201d Fifth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a solidly reinstated dharma, the bull of religion, on his four legs of compassion, austerity, cleanliness and truth. Thus dharma could once again become go-tra, the protector of the earth. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also established the religious function of Govardhana-p\u016bj\u0101 to honor His favorite hill, the cows and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. He also became the hill (gotra) Himself, assuming its form to accept the cowherds\u2019 offerings. Moreover, He cultivated the dharma, or loving nature, of Vraja\u2019s divine cowherds (gotras), whose love for Him has never been equaled. These are just a few of the wonderful features of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s unique personality."

Vasudeva and Devak\u012b were only Their official father and mother. Their actual father and mother were Nanda and Ya\u015bod\u0101. Therefore \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as devak\u012b-janma-v\u0101da. \u201c\u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b then glorifies the Lord as one who is honored by the yadu-vara-pari\u1e63at, the assembly house of the Yadu dynasty, and as the killer of different kinds of demons. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have killed all the demons by employing His different material energies, but He wanted to kill them personally in order to give them salvation. There was no need of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s coming to this material world to kill the demons. Simply by His willing, many hundreds and thousands of demons could have been killed without His personal endeavor. But actually He descended for His pure devotees, to play as a child with mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and to give pleasure to the inhabitants of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. By killing the demons and by giving protection to the devotees, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a established the real religious principle, which is simply love of God. By following the factual religious principles of love of God, even the living entities known as sthira-cara were also delivered from all material contamination and were transferred to the spiritual kingdom. Sthira means the trees and plants, which cannot move, and cara means the moving animals, especially the cows. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present, He delivered all the trees, monkeys and other plants and animals who happened to see Him and serve Him both in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and Dv\u0101rak\u0101."

According to \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has composed this beautiful verse to console those who lament the fact that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not continue to manifest His intimate pastimes down to the present time. Here \u015ar\u012b \u015aukadeva reminds his listeners that the Lord is eternally present in this world \u2014 in His holy abode, His name and the recitation of His glories. This idea is expressed by the word jayati (\u201cHe is victorious\u201d), which is in the present tense rather than the past. \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da explains this verse as follows in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u201c\u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b thus concludes his description of the superexalted position of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by glorifying Him in the following way: \u2018O Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all glories unto You. You are present in everyone\u2019s heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101.

The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers accept the all-pervading feature of Parabrahman, but when Parabrahman, or the Supreme Lord, appears, they think that He appears under the control of material nature.

Therefore \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b warns them: devak\u012b-janma-v\u0101da\u1e25, which means that although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is famous as the son of Devak\u012b, actually He is the Supersoul, or the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u201cThe devotees, however, take this word devak\u012b-janma-v\u0101da in a different way. The devotees understand that actually K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the son of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first of all appeared as the son of Devak\u012b, He immediately transferred Himself to the lap of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and His childhood pastimes were blissfully enjoyed by mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja.

The exact words used in this connection are vardhayan k\u0101madevam. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, as the boyfriend of many gop\u012bs, and in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, as the husband of many queens, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a increased their lusty desires to enjoy with Him. For God realization or self-realization, one generally has to undergo severe austerities and penances for many, many thousands of years, and then it may be possible to realize God. But the gop\u012bs and the queens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, simply by enhancing their lusty desires to enjoy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as their boyfriend or husband, received the highest type of salvation.\u201d"

Simply by His willing, many hundreds and thousands of demons could have been killed without His personal endeavor. But actually He descended for His pure devotees, to play as a child with mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 and Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and to give pleasure to the inhabitants of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. By killing the demons and by giving protection to the devotees, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a established the real religious principle, which is simply love of God. By following the factual religious principles of love of God, even the living entities known as sthira-cara were also delivered from all material contamination and were transferred to the spiritual kingdom. Sthira means the trees and plants, which cannot move, and cara means the moving animals, especially the cows. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present, He delivered all the trees, monkeys and other plants and animals who happened to see Him and serve Him both in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and Dv\u0101rak\u0101. \u201cLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is especially glorified for giving pleasure to the gop\u012bs and the queens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b glorifies Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for His enchanting smile, by which He enchanted not only the gop\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana but also the queens at Dv\u0101rak\u0101. The exact words used in this connection are vardhayan k\u0101madevam. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, as the boyfriend of many gop\u012bs, and in Dv\u0101rak\u0101, as the husband of many queens, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a increased their lusty desires to enjoy with Him. For God realization or self-realization, one generally has to undergo severe austerities and penances for many, many thousands of years, and then it may be possible to realize God. But the gop\u012bs and the queens of Dv\u0101rak\u0101, simply by enhancing their lusty desires to enjoy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as their boyfriend or husband, received the highest type of salvation.\u201d In this way \u015ar\u012bla Prabhup\u0101da wonderfully illuminates the meaning of this verse by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, which summarizes Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes."

        "translation": "By regularly hearing, chanting and meditating on the beautiful topics of Lord Mukunda with ever-increasing sincerity, a mortal being will attain the divine kingdom of the Lord, where the inviolable power of death holds no sway. For this purpose, many persons, including great kings, abandoned their mundane homes and took to the forest.",
        "purport": " For the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam\u2019s Tenth Canto, this verse is the phala-\u015bruti, the promise of success given to one who hears it. The process of devotional service begins with hearing topics about the Supreme Lord. When one has heard these topics properly, he can then proceed to chant them for others\u2019 benefit and reflect on their significance. This leads to faithful adherence to the principles of devotional service, which culminates in absolute faith in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such perfect faith gives one the right to enter the Lord\u2019s intimate service and, in due course of time, return to one\u2019s eternal, spiritual life in one of the Lord\u2019s personal domains. Humbly offering his comments on the Tenth Canto at the lotus feet of his worshipable Lord, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b prays: \u201cIf Lord Gop\u0101la mercifully accepts the cows of my words, then His dear devotees may enjoy the pleasure of drinking their milk \u2014 the nectar produced by hearing them.\u201d The Tenth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam was completed on December 27, 1988, the anniversary of \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura\u2019s disappearance."
