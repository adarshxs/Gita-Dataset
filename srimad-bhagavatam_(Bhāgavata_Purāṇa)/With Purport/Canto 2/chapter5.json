In the previous chapter it has been established that Brahm\u0101j\u012b, the firstborn living entity, received knowledge directly from the Supreme Lord, and the same knowledge was imparted to N\u0101rada, the next disciple. N\u0101rada asked to receive the knowledge, and Brahm\u0101j\u012b imparted it upon being asked. Therefore, asking for transcendental knowledge from the right person and receiving it properly is the regulation of the disciplic succession. This process is recommended in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.2). The inquisitive student must approach a qualified spiritual master to receive transcendental knowledge by surrender, submissive inquiries and service. Knowledge received by submissive inquiries and service is more effective than knowledge received in exchange for money. A spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from Brahm\u0101 and N\u0101rada has no demand for dollars and cents. A bona fide student has to satisfy him by sincere service to obtain knowledge of the relation and nature of the individual soul and the Supersoul."

Contrary to such mental speculative theories of creation, however, N\u0101rada Muni wanted to know all the facts of creation in truth, and not by theories. Transcendental knowledge regarding the soul and the Supersoul includes knowledge of the phenomenal world and the basis of its creation. In the phenomenal world three things are factually observed by any intelligent man: the living beings, the manifest world, and the ultimate control over them. The intelligent man can see that neither the living entity nor the phenomenal world are creations of chance. The symmetry of creation and its regulative actions and reactions suggests the plan of an intelligent brain behind them, and by genuine inquiry one may find out the ultimate cause with the help of one who knows them factually."

A spiritual master is duly respected on a par with God, but a spiritual master claiming to be God Himself should at once be rejected. N\u0101rada Muni accepted Brahm\u0101 as the Supreme due to Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s wonderful acts in creation, but doubts arose in him when he saw that Lord Brahm\u0101 also worshiped some superior authority. The Supreme is supreme, and He has no worshipable superior. The aha\u1e45grahop\u0101sit\u0101, or the one who worships himself with the idea of becoming God Himself, is misleading, but the intelligent disciple can at once detect that the Supreme God does not need to worship anyone, including Himself, in order to become God. Aha\u1e45grahop\u0101san\u0101 may be one of the processes for transcendental realization, but the aha\u1e45grahop\u0101sit\u0101 can never be God Himself. No one becomes God by undergoing a process of transcendental realization. N\u0101rada Muni thought of Brahm\u0101j\u012b as the Supreme Person, but when he saw Brahm\u0101j\u012b engaged in the process of transcendental realization, doubts arose in him. So he wanted to be clearly informed."

        "purport": " \u201cThe frog in the well\u201d logic illustrates that a frog residing in the atmosphere and boundary of a well cannot imagine the length and breadth of the gigantic ocean. Such a frog, when informed of the gigantic length and breadth of the ocean, first of all does not believe that there is such an ocean, and if someone assures him that factually there is such a thing, the frog then begins to measure it by imagination by means of pumping its belly as far as possible, with the result that the tiny abdomen of the frog bursts and the poor frog dies without any experience of the actual ocean. Similarly, the material scientists also want to challenge the inconceivable potency of the Lord by measuring Him with their froglike brains and their scientific achievements, but at the end they simply die unsuccessfully, like the frog. Sometimes a materially powerful man is accepted as God or the incarnation of God without any knowledge of the factual God. Such a material assessment may be gradually extended, and the attempt may reach to the highest limit of Brahm\u0101j\u012b, who is the topmost living being within the universe and has a duration of life unimaginable to the material scientist. As we get information from the most authentic book of knowledge, the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.17), Brahm\u0101j\u012b\u2019s one day and night is calculated to be some hundreds of thousands of years on our planet. This long duration of life may not be believed by \u201cthe frog in the well,\u201d but persons who have a realization of the truths mentioned in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 accept the existence of a great personality who creates the variegatedness of the complete universe. It is understood from the revealed scriptures that the Brahm\u0101j\u012b of this universe is younger than all the other Brahm\u0101s in charge of the many, many universes beyond this, but none of them can be equal to the Personality of Godhead. N\u0101radaj\u012b is one of the liberated souls, and after his liberation he was known as N\u0101rada; otherwise, before his liberation, he was simply a son of a maidservant. The questions may be asked why N\u0101radaj\u012b was not aware of the Supreme Lord and why he misconceived Brahm\u0101j\u012b to be the Supreme Lord, although factually he was not. A liberated soul is never bewildered by such a mistaken idea, so why did N\u0101radaj\u012b ask all those questions just like an ordinary man with a poor fund of knowledge? There was such bewilderment in Arjuna also, although he is eternally the associate of the Lord. Such bewilderment in Arjuna or in N\u0101rada takes place by the will of the Lord so that other, nonliberated persons may realize the real truth and knowledge of the Lord. The doubt arising in the mind of N\u0101rada about Brahm\u0101j\u012b\u2019s becoming all-powerful is a lesson for the frogs in the well, that they may not be bewildered in misconceiving the identity of the Personality of Godhead (even by comparison to a personality like Brahm\u0101, so what to speak of ordinary men who falsely pose themselves as God or an incarnation of God). The Supreme Lord is always the Supreme, and as we have tried to establish many times in these purports, no living being, even up to the standard of Brahm\u0101, can claim to be one with the Lord. One should not be misled when people worship a great man as God after his death as a matter of hero worship. There were many kings like Lord R\u0101macandra, the King of Ayodhy\u0101, but none of them are mentioned as God in the revealed scriptures. To be a good king is not necessarily the qualification for being Lord R\u0101ma, but to be a great personality like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the qualification for being the Personality of Godhead. If we scrutinize the characters who took part in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, we may find that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was no less a pious king than Lord R\u0101macandra, and by character study Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was a better moralist than Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a asked Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to lie, but Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira protested. But that does not mean that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira could be equal to Lord R\u0101macandra or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The great authorities have estimated Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to be a pious man, but they have accepted Lord R\u0101ma or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Personality of Godhead. The Lord is therefore a different identity in all circumstances, and no idea of anthropomorphism can be applied to Him. The Lord is always the Lord, and a common living being can never be equal to Him."

        "purport": " Lord Brahm\u0101j\u012b said to N\u0101rada that his impression that Brahm\u0101 was not the supreme authority in the creation was correct. Sometimes less intelligent men have the foolish impression that Brahm\u0101 is the cause of all causes. But N\u0101rada wanted to clear the matter by the statements of Brahm\u0101j\u012b, the supreme authority in the universe. As the decision of the supreme court of a state is final, similarly the judgment of Brahm\u0101j\u012b, the supreme authority in the universe, is final in the Vedic process of acquiring knowledge. As we have already affirmed in the previous verse, N\u0101radaj\u012b was a liberated soul; therefore, he was not one of the less intelligent men who accept a false god or gods in their own ways. He represented himself as less intelligent and yet intelligently presented a doubt to be cleared by the supreme authority so that the uninformed might take note of it and be rightly informed about the intricacies of the creation and the creator. In this verse Brahm\u0101j\u012b clears up the wrong impression held by the less intelligent and affirms that he creates the universal variegatedness after the creation by the glaring effulgence of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Brahm\u0101j\u012b has also separately given this statement in the sa\u1e41hit\u0101 known as the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.40), where he says: \u201cI serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental bodily effulgence, known as the brahmajyoti, which is unlimited, unfathomed and all-pervasive, is the cause of the creation of unlimited numbers of planets, etc., with varieties of climates and specific conditions of life.\u201d The same statement is in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.27). Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the background of the brahmajyoti (brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham). In the Nirukti, or Vedic dictionary, the import of prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 is mentioned as \u201cthat which establishes.\u201d So the brahmajyoti is not independent or self-sufficient. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ultimately the creator of the brahmajyoti, mentioned in this verse as sva-roci\u1e63\u0101, or the effulgence of the transcendental body of the Lord. This brahmajyoti is all-pervading, and all creation is made possible by its power; therefore the Vedic hymns declare that everything that exists is being sustained by the brahmajyoti (sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma). Therefore the potent seed of all creation is the brahmajyoti, and the same brahmajyoti, unlimited and unfathomed, is established by the Lord. Therefore the Lord (\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) is ultimately the supreme cause of all creation (aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25). One should not expect the Lord to create like a blacksmith with a hammer and other instruments. The Lord creates by His potencies. He has His multifarious potencies (par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate). Just as the small seed of a banyan fruit has the potency to create a big banyan tree, the Lord disseminates all varieties of seeds by His potent brahmajyoti (sva-roci\u1e63\u0101), and the seeds are made to develop by the watering process of persons like Brahm\u0101. Brahm\u0101 cannot create the seeds, but he can manifest the seed into a tree, just as a gardener helps plants and orchards to grow by the watering process. The example cited here of the sun is very appropriate. In the material world the sun is the cause of all illumination: fire, electricity, the rays of the moon, etc. All luminaries in the sky are creations of the sun, the sun is the creation of the brahmajyoti, and the brahmajyoti is the effulgence of the Lord. Thus the ultimate cause of creation is the Lord."

Those who are before the Lord, however, and who surrender unto Him, cannot be influenced by the deluding energy; therefore they are free from the misconception of \u201cIt is I,\u201d \u201cIt is mine,\u201d and therefore they do not accept a false God or pose themselves as equal to the Supreme Lord.

        "purport": " This phenomenal world is impersonally the representation of V\u0101sudeva because the ingredients of its creation, their interaction and the enjoyer of the resultant action, the living being, are all produced by the external and internal energies of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.4-5). The ingredients, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, as well as the conception of material identity, intelligence and the mind, are produced of the external energy of the Lord. The living entity who enjoys the interaction of the above gross and subtle ingredients, as set up by eternal time, is an offshoot of internal potency, with freedom to remain either in the material world or in the spiritual world. In the material world the living entity is enticed by deluding nescience, but in the spiritual world he is in the normal condition of spiritual existence without any delusion. The living entity is known as the marginal potency of the Lord. But in all circumstances, neither the material ingredients nor the spiritual parts and parcels are independent of the Personality of Godhead V\u0101sudeva, for all things, whether products of the external, internal or marginal potencies of the Lord, are simply displays of the same effulgence of the Lord, just as light, heat and smoke are displays of fire. None of them is separate from the fire \u2014 all of them combine together to be called fire. Similarly, all phenomenal manifestations, as well as the effulgence of the body of V\u0101sudeva, are His impersonal features, whereas He eternally exists in His transcendental form called sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25, distinct from all conceptions of the material ingredients mentioned above."

        "purport": " According to the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras (\u015b\u0101stra-yonitv\u0101t), the Supreme Lord is the author of all revealed scriptures, and all revealed scriptures are for knowing the Supreme Lord. Veda means knowledge that leads to the Lord. The Vedas are made just to revive the forgotten consciousness of the conditioned souls, and any literature not meant for reviving God consciousness is rejected at once by the n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-para devotees. Such deluding books of knowledge, not having N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a as their aim, are not at all knowledge, but are the playgrounds for crows who are interested in the rejected refuse of the world. Any book of knowledge (science or art) must lead to the knowledge of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; otherwise it must be rejected. That is the way of advancement of knowledge. The supreme worshipable Deity is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. The demigods are recommended secondarily for worship in relation to N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a because the demigods are assisting hands in the management of the universal affairs. As the officers of a kingdom are respected due to their relation to the king, the demigods are worshiped due to their relation to the Lord. Without the Lord\u2019s relation, worship of the demigods is unauthorized (avidhi-p\u016brvakam), just as it is improper to water the leaves and branches of a tree without watering its root. Therefore the demigods are also dependent on N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. The lokas, or different planets, are attractive because they have different varieties of life and bliss partially representing the sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. Everyone wants the eternal life of bliss and knowledge. In the material world such an eternal life of bliss and knowledge is progressively realized in the upper planets, but after reaching there one is inclined to achieve further progress along the path back to Godhead. Duration of life, with a proportionate quantity of bliss and knowledge, may be increased from one planet to another. One can increase the duration of life to thousands and hundreds of thousands of years in different planets, but nowhere is there eternal life. But one who can reach the highest planet, that of Brahm\u0101, can aspire to reach the planets in the spiritual sky, where life is eternal. Therefore, the progressive journey from one planet to another culminates in reaching the supreme planet of the Lord (mad-dh\u0101ma), where life is eternal and full of bliss and knowledge. All different kinds of sacrifice are performed just to satisfy Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a with a view to reach Him, and the best sacrifice recommended in this Age of Kali is sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, the mainstay of the devotional service of a n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-para devotee."

A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga is practice in concentrating the mind, releasing oneself from all engagements by the regulative processes of meditation, concentration, sitting postures, blocking the movements of the internal circulation of air, etc. S\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga is meant to distinguish the truth from ephemerals. But ultimately both systems are meant for realizing the impersonal Brahman, which is but a partial representation of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. As we have explained before, the impersonal Brahman effulgence is only a part of the Personality of Godhead. Impersonal Brahman is situated on the person of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, as such, Brahman is the glorification of the Personality of the Godhead. This is confirmed both in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and in the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a. Gati refers to the ultimate destination, or the last word in liberation. Oneness with the impersonal brahmajyoti is not ultimate liberation; superior to that is the sublime association of the Personality of Godhead in one of the innumerable spiritual planets in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha sky. Therefore the conclusion is that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or the Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate destination for all kinds of yoga systems as well as all kinds of liberation."

        "purport": " Even Brahm\u0101, the creator of the universe, admits that he is not the actual creator but is simply inspired by the Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and therefore creates under His superintendence those things already created by Him, the Supersoul of all living entities. Two identities of soul, the Supersoul and the individual soul, are admitted to be in the living entity, even by the greatest authority of the universe. The Supersoul is the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, whereas the individual soul is the eternal servitor of the Lord. The Lord inspires the individual soul to create what is already created by the Lord, and by the good will of the Lord a discoverer of something in the world is accredited as the discoverer. It is said that Columbus discovered the Western Hemisphere, but actually the tract of land was not created by Columbus. The vast tract of land was already there by the omnipotency of the Supreme Lord, and Columbus, by dint of his past service unto the Lord, was blessed with the credit of discovering America. Similarly, no one can create anything without the sanction of the Lord, since everyone sees according to his ability. This ability is also awarded by the Lord according to one\u2019s willingness to render service unto the Lord. One must therefore be voluntarily willing to render service unto the Lord, and thus the Lord will empower the doer in proportion to his surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord Brahm\u0101 is a great devotee of the Lord; therefore he has been empowered or inspired by the Lord to create such a universe as the one manifested before us. The Lord also inspired Arjuna to fight in the field of Kuruk\u1e63etra as follows: The Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, or any other battle at any place or at any time, is made by the will of the Lord, for no one can arrange such mass annihilation without the sanction of the Lord. The party of Duryodhana insulted Draupad\u012b, a great devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and she appealed to the Lord as well as to all the silent observers of this unwarranted insult. Arjuna was then advised by the Lord to fight and take credit; otherwise the party of Duryodhana would be killed anyway by the will of the Lord. So Arjuna was advised just to become the agent and take the credit for killing great generals like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Kar\u1e47a. In the Vedic writings such as the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad, the Lord is described as the sarva-bh\u016bta-antar\u0101tm\u0101, or the Personality of Godhead who resides in everyone\u2019s body and who directs everything for one who is a soul surrendered unto Him. Those who are not surrendered souls are put under the care of the material nature (bhr\u0101mayan sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni yantr\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101ni m\u0101yay\u0101); therefore, they are allowed to do things on their own account and suffer the consequences themselves. Devotees like Brahm\u0101 and Arjuna do not do anything on their own account, but as fully surrendered souls they always await indications from the Lord; therefore they attempt to do something which appears very wonderful to ordinary vision. One of the Lord\u2019s names is Urukrama, or one whose actions are very wonderful and are beyond the imagination of the living being, so the actions of His devotees sometimes appear very wonderful due to the direction of the Lord. Beginning from Brahm\u0101, the topmost intelligent living entity within the universe, down to the smallest ant, every living entity\u2019s intelligence is overseen by the Lord in His transcendental position as the witness of all actions. The subtle presence of the Lord is felt by the intelligent man who can study the psychic effects of thinking, feeling and willing."

In other words, the material modes of nature, being products of the energy of the Lord, are certainly connected with the Lord, but the connection is just like that between the master and the servants. The Supreme Lord is the controller of the material energy, whereas the living entities, who are entangled in the material world, are neither masters nor controllers. Rather, they become subordinate to or controlled by such energy. Factually the Lord is eternally manifested by His internal potency or spiritual energy just like the sun and its rays in the clear sky, but at times He creates the material energy, as the sun creates a cloud in the clear sky. As the sun is ever increasingly unaffected by a spot of cloud, so also the unlimited Lord is unaffected by the spot of material energy manifested at times in the unlimited span of the Lord\u2019s rays of brahmajyoti."

The adhibh\u016bta manifestation entails repetitions of births and deaths with old age and diseases, the adhy\u0101tma manifestation conditions the spirit soul, and the adhidaiva manifestation is the controlling system.

The fact is that such impersonalists are covered by the above-mentioned three modes of material nature; therefore, they are unable to approach the transcendental personality of the Lord. The Lord is not approachable by everyone because He is curtained by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 potency.

        "purport": " The creation of the material world, wherein the conditioned souls are allowed to act subordinately by the Supreme Lord, takes place again and again after being repeatedly annihilated. The material creation is something like a cloud in the unlimited sky. The real sky is the spiritual sky, eternally filled with the rays of the brahmajyoti, and a portion of this unlimited sky is covered by the mahat-tattva cloud of the material creation, in which the conditioned souls, who want to lord it against the will of the Lord, are put into play as they desire, under the control of the Lord by the agency of His external energy. As the rainy season appears and disappears regularly, the creation takes place and is again annihilated under the control of the Lord, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.19). So the creation and annihilation of the material worlds is a regular action of the Lord just to allow the conditioned souls to play as they like and thereby create their own fate of being differently created again in terms of their independent desires at the time of annihilation. The creation, therefore, takes place at a historical date (as we are accustomed to think of everything which has a beginning in our tiny experience). The process of creation and annihilation is called an\u0101di, or without reference to date regarding the time the creation first took place, because the duration of even a partial creation is 8,640,000,000 years. The law of creation is, however, as mentioned in the Vedic literatures, that it is created at certain intervals and is again annihilated by the will of the Lord. The whole material or even the spiritual creation is a manifestation of the energy of the Lord, just as the light and heat of a fire are different manifestations of the fire\u2019s energy. The Lord therefore exists in His impersonal form by such expansion of energy, and the complete creation rests on His impersonal feature. Nonetheless He keeps Himself distinct from such creation as the p\u016br\u1e47am (or complete), and so no one should wrongly think that His personal feature is not existent due to His impersonal unlimited expansions. The impersonal expansion is a manifestation of His energy, and He is always in His personal feature despite His innumerable unlimited expansions of impersonal energies (Bg. 9.5-7). For human intelligence it is very difficult to conceive how the whole creation rests on His expansion of energy, but the Lord has given a very good example in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. It is said that although the air and the atoms rest within the huge expansion of the sky, which is like the resting reservoir of everything materially created, still the sky remains separate and unaffected. Similarly, although the Supreme Lord maintains everything created by His expansion of energy, He always remains separate. This is accepted even by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, the great advocate of the impersonal form of the Absolute. He says n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 paro\u00a0\u2019vyakt\u0101t, or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a exists separately, apart from the impersonal creative energy. The whole creation thus merges within the body of transcendental N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at the time of annihilation, and the creation emanates from His body again with the same unchanging categories of fate and individual nature. The individual living entities, being parts and parcels of the Lord, are sometimes described as \u0101tm\u0101, qualitatively one in spiritual constitution. But because such living entities are apt to be attracted to the material creation, actively and subjectively, they are therefore different from the Lord."

Material nature is called the mother, and the initiator for materialistic life is the father, Lord \u015aiva. All material creation by the living entities is therefore initiated by the mode of passion. With the advancement of the duration of life in a particular millennium, the different modes act by gradual development. In the , as such Age of Kali (when the mode of passion is most prominent) material activities of different varieties, in the name of advancement of human civilization, take place, and the living entities become more and more involved in forgetting their real identity \u2014 the spiritual nature. By a slight cultivation of the mode of goodness, a glimpse of spiritual nature is perceived, but due to the prominence of the mode of passion, the mode of goodness becomes adulterated. Therefore one cannot transcend the limits of the material modes, and therefore realization of the Lord, who is always transcendental to the modes of material nature, becomes very difficult for the living entities, even though prominently situated in the mode of goodness through cultivation of the various methods. In other words, the gross matters are adhibh\u016btam, their maintenance is adhidaivam, and the initiator of material activities is called adhy\u0101tmam. In the material world these three principles act as prominent features, namely as raw material, its regular supplies, and its use in different varieties of material creations for sense enjoyment by the bewildered entities."

N\u0101rada, you are quite competent to understand this.",
        "purport": " Materialistic ego, or the sense of identification with matter, is grossly self-centered, devoid of clear knowledge of the existence of God. And this self-centered egoism of the materialistic living entities is the cause of their being conditioned by the other paraphernalia and continuing their bondage of material existence. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this self-centered egoism is very nicely explained in the Seventh Chapter (verses 24 through 27). The self-centered impersonalist, without a clear conception of the Personality of Godhead, concludes in his own way that the Personality of Godhead takes a material shape from His original impersonal spiritual existence for a particular mission. And this misleading conception of the Supreme Lord by the self-centered impersonalist continues, even though he is seen to be very interested in the Vedic literatures such as the Brahma-s\u016btras and other highly intellectual sources of knowledge. This ignorance of the personal feature of the Lord is due simply to ignorance of the mixture of different modes. The impersonalist thus cannot conceive of the Lord\u2019s eternal spiritual form of eternal knowledge, bliss and existence. The reason is that the Lord reserves the right of not exposing Himself to the nondevotee who, even after a thorough study of literature like the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, remains an impersonalist simply by obstinacy. This obstinacy is due to the action of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, a personal energy of the Lord that acts like an aide-de-camp by covering the vision of the obstinate impersonalist. Such a bewildered human being is described as m\u016b\u1e0dha, or grossly ignorant, because he is unable to understand the transcendental form of the Lord as being unborn and unchangeable. If the Lord takes a form or material shape from His original impersonal feature, then it means that He is born and changeable from impersonal to personal. But He is not changeable. Nor does He ever take a new birth like a conditioned soul. The conditioned soul may take a form birth after birth due to his conditional existence in matter, but the self-centered impersonalists, by their gross ignorance, accept the Lord as one of them because of self-centered egoism, even after so-called advancement of knowledge in the Ved\u0101nta. The Lord, being situated in the heart of every individual living entity, knows very well the tendency of such conditioned souls in terms of past, present and future, but the bewildered conditioned soul hardly can know Him in His eternal form. By the will of the Lord, therefore, the impersonalist, even after knowing the Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101 features of the Lord, remains ignorant of His eternal personal feature as ever-existent N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, transcendental to all material creation. The cause of such gross ignorance is constant engagement by the materialistic man in the matter of artificially increasing material demands. To realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one has to purify the materialistic senses by devotional service. The mode of goodness, or the brahminical culture recommended in the Vedic literatures, is helpful to such spiritual realization, and thus the j\u00f1\u0101na-\u015bakti stage of the conditioned soul is comparatively better than the other two stages, namely dravya-\u015bakti and kriy\u0101-\u015bakti. The whole material civilization is manifested by a huge accumulation of materials, or in other words, raw materials for industrial purposes, and the industrial enterprises (kriy\u0101-\u015bakti) are all due to gross ignorance of spiritual life. In order to rectify this great anomaly of materialistic civilization, based on the principles of dravya-\u015bakti and kriy\u0101-\u015bakti, one has to adopt the process of devotional service of the Lord by adoption of the principles of karma-yoga, mentioned in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.27) as follows: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.\u201d"

        "translation": "From the darkness of false ego, the first of the five elements, namely the sky, is generated. Its subtle form is the quality of sound, exactly as the seer is in relationship with the seen.",
        "purport": " The five elements, namely sky, air, fire, water and earth, are all but different qualities of the darkness of false ego. This means that the false ego in the sum total form of mahat-tattva is generated from the marginal potency of the Lord, and due to this false ego of lording it over the material creation, ingredients are generated for the false enjoyment of the living being. The living being is practically the dominating factor over the material elements as the enjoyer, though the background is the Supreme Lord. Factually, save and except the Lord, no one can be called the enjoyer, but the living entity falsely desires to become the enjoyer. This is the origin of false ego. When the bewildered living being desires this, the shadow elements are generated by the will of the Lord, and the living entities are allowed to run after them as after a phantasmagoria. It is said that first the tan-m\u0101tr\u0101 sound is created and then the sky, and in this verse it is confirmed that actually it is so, but sound is the subtle form of the sky, and the distinction is like that between the seer and the seen. The sound is the representation of the actual object, as the sound produced speaking of the object gives an idea of the description of the object. Therefore sound is the subtle characteristic of the object. Similarly, sound representation of the Lord, in terms of His characteristics, is the complete form of the Lord, as was seen by Vasudeva and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Da\u015baratha, the fathers of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord R\u0101ma. The sound representation of the Lord is nondifferent from the Lord Himself because the Lord and His representation in sound are absolute knowledge. Lord Caitanya has instructed us that in the holy name of the Lord, as sound representation of the Lord, all the potencies of the Lord are invested. Thus one can immediately enjoy the association of the Lord by the pure vibration of the sound representation of His holy name, and the concept of the Lord is immediately manifested before the pure devotee. A pure devotee, therefore, is not aloof from the Lord even for a moment. The holy name of the Lord, as recommended in the \u015b\u0101stras \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 may therefore be constantly chanted by the devotee aspiring to be constantly in touch with the Supreme Lord. One who is thus able to associate with the Lord is sure to be delivered from the darkness of the created world, which is a product of false ego (tamasi m\u0101 jyotir gama)."

        "translation": "Because the sky is transformed, the air is generated with the quality of touch, and by previous succession the air is also full of sound and the basic principles of duration of life: sense perception, mental power and bodily strength. When the air is transformed in course of time and nature\u2019s course, fire is generated, taking shape with the sense of touch and sound. Since fire is also transformed, there is a manifestation of water, full of juice and taste. As previously, it also has form and touch and is also full of sound. And water, being transformed from all variegatedness on earth, appears odorous and, as previously, becomes qualitatively full of juice, touch, sound and form respectively.",
        "purport": " The whole process of creation is an act of gradual evolution and development from one element to another, reaching up to the variegatedness of the earth as so many trees, plants, mountains, rivers, reptiles, birds, animals and varieties of human beings. The quality of sense perception is also evolutionary, namely generated from sound, then touch, and from touch to form. Taste and odor are also generated along with the gradual development of sky, air, fire, water and earth. They are all mutually the cause and effect of one another, but the original cause is the Lord Himself in plenary portion, as Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u lying in the causal water of the mahat-tattva. As such, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as the cause of all causes, and this is confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8) as follows: The qualities of sense perception are fully represented in the earth, and they are manifested in other elements to a lesser extent. In the sky there is sound only, whereas in the air there are sound and touch. In the fire there are sound, touch and shape, and in the water there is taste also, along with the other perceptions, namely sound, touch and shape. In the earth, however, there are all the above-mentioned qualities with an extra development of odor also. Therefore on the earth there is a full display of variegatedness of life, which is originally started with the basic principle of air. Diseases of the body take place due to derangement of air within the earthly body of the living beings. Mental diseases result from special derangement of the air within the body, and, as such, yogic exercise is especially beneficial to keep the air in order so that diseases of the body become almost nil by such exercises. When they are properly done the duration of life also increases, and one can have control over death also by such practices. A perfect yog\u012b can have command over death and quit the body at the right moment, when he is competent to transfer himself to a suitable planet. The bhakti-yog\u012b, however, surpasses all the yog\u012bs because, by dint of his devotional service, he is promoted to the region beyond the material sky and is placed in one of the planets in the spiritual sky by the supreme will of the Lord, the controller of everything."

All come into existence.",
        "purport": " Vaik\u0101rika is the neutral stage of creation, and tejas is the initiative of creation, while tamas is the full display of material creation under the spell of the darkness of ignorance. Manufacture of the \u201cnecessities of life\u201d in factories and workshops, excessively prominent in the Age of Kali, or in the age of the machine, is the summit stage of the quality of darkness. Such manufacturing enterprises by human society are in the mode of darkness because factually there is no necessity for the commodities manufactured. Human society primarily requires food for subsistence, shelter for sleeping, defense for protection, and commodities for satisfaction of the senses. The senses are the practical signs of life, as will be explained in the next verse. Human civilization is meant for purifying the senses, and objects of sense satisfaction should be supplied as much as absolutely required, but not for aggravating artificial sensory needs. Food, shelter, defense and sense gratification are all needs in material existence. Otherwise, in his pure, uncontaminated state of original life, the living entity has no such needs. The needs are therefore artificial, and in the pure state of life there are no such needs. As such, increasing the artificial needs, as is the standard of material civilization, or advancing the economic development of human society, is a sort of engagement in darkness, without knowledge. By such engagement, human energy is spoiled, because human energy is primarily meant for purifying the senses in order to engage them in satisfying the senses of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord, being the supreme possessor of spiritual senses, is the master of the senses, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bka means the senses, and \u012b\u015ba means the master. The Lord is not the servant of the senses, or, in other words, He is not directed by the dictation of the senses, but the conditioned souls or the individual living entities are servants of the senses. They are conducted by the direction or dictation of the senses, and therefore material civilization is a kind of engagement in sense gratification only. The standard of human civilization should be to cure the disease of sense gratification, and one can do this simply by becoming an agent for satisfying the spiritual senses of the Lord. The senses are never to be stopped in their engagements, but one should purify them by engaging them in the pure service of sense gratification of the master of the senses. This is the instruction of the whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Arjuna wanted first of all to satisfy his own senses by his decision not to fight with his kinsmen and friends, but Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a taught him the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 just to purify Arjuna\u2019s decision for sense gratification. Therefore Arjuna agreed to satisfy the senses of the Lord, and thus he fought the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, as the Lord desired. The Vedas instruct us to get out of the existence of darkness and go forward on the path of light (tamasi m\u0101 jyotir gama). The path of light is therefore to satisfy the senses of the Lord. Misguided men, or less intelligent men, follow the path of self-realization without any attempt to satisfy the transcendental senses of the Lord by following the path shown by Arjuna and other devotees of the Lord. On the contrary, they artificially try to stop the activities of the senses (yoga system), or they deny the transcendental senses of the Lord (j\u00f1\u0101na system). The devotees, however, are above the yog\u012bs and the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs because pure devotees do not deny the senses of the Lord; they want to satisfy the senses of the Lord. Only because of the darkness of ignorance do the yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs deny the senses of the Lord and thus artificially try to control the activities of the diseased senses. In the diseased condition of the senses there is too much engagement of the senses in increasing material needs. When one comes to see the disadvantage of aggravating the sense activities, one is called a j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, and when one tries to stop the activities of the senses by the practice of yogic principles, he is called a yog\u012b, but when one is fully aware of the transcendental senses of the Lord and tries to satisfy His senses, one is called a devotee of the Lord. The devotees of the Lord do not try to deny the senses of the Lord, nor do they artificially stop the actions of the senses. But they do voluntarily engage the purified senses in the service of the master of the senses, as was done by Arjuna, thereby easily attaining the perfection of satisfying the Lord, the ultimate goal of all perfection."

        "purport": " The different types of bodily construction of the living entities are exactly like different types of motorcars manufactured by assembling the allied motor parts. When the car is ready, the driver sits in the car and moves it as he desires. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61): the living entity is as if seated on the machine of the body, and the car of the body is moving by the control of material nature, just as the railway trains are moving under the direction of the controller. The living entities, however, are not the bodies; they are separate from the cars of the body. But the less intelligent material scientist cannot understand the process of assembling the parts of the body, namely the senses, the mind and the qualities of the material modes. Every living entity is a spiritual spark, part and parcel of the Supreme Being, and by the kindness of the Lord, for the Father is kind to His sons, the individual living beings are given a little freedom to act according to their will to lord it over the material nature. Just as a father gives some playthings to the crying child to satisfy him, the whole material creation is made possible by the will of the Lord to allow the bewildered living entities to lord it over things as they desire, although under the control of the agent of the Lord. The living entities are exactly like small children playing the material field under the control of the maidservant of the Lord (nature). They accept the m\u0101y\u0101, or the maidservant, as all in all and thus wrongly conceive the Supreme Truth to be feminine (goddess Durg\u0101, etc.). The foolish, childlike materialists cannot reach beyond the conception of the maidservant, material nature, but the intelligent grown-up sons of the Lord know well that all the acts of material nature are controlled by the Lord, just as a maidservant is under the control of the master, the father of the undeveloped children. The parts of the body, such as the senses, are the creation of the mahat-tattva, and when they are assembled by the will of the Lord, the material body comes into existence, and the living entity is allowed to use it for further activities. This is explained as follows."

He expands Himself by His different energies, as well as by His plenary portions. In a corner of the spiritual sky of brahmajyoti a spiritual cloud sometimes appears, and the covered portion is called the mahat-tattva. The Lord then, by His plenary portion as Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, lies down within the water of the mahat-tattva, and the water is called the Causal Ocean (K\u0101ra\u1e47a-jala). While Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u sleeps within the Causal Ocean, innumerable universes are generated along with His breathing. These universes are floating, and they are scattered all over the Causal Ocean. They stay only during the breathing period of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In each and every universal globe, the same Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters again as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and lies there on the serpentlike \u015ae\u1e63a incarnation. From His navel sprouts a lotus stem, and on the lotus, Brahm\u0101, the lord of the universe, is born. Brahm\u0101 creates all forms of living beings of different shapes in terms of different desires within the universe. He also creates the sun, moon and other demigods. Therefore the chief engineer of the material creation is the Lord Himself, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10). It is He only who directs the material nature to produce all sorts of moving and nonmoving creations. There are two modes of material creation: the creation of the collective universes, as stated above, done by the Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and the creation of the single universe. Both are done by the Lord, and thus the universal shape, as we can see, takes place."

So, as described above, the Lord as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or Hira\u1e47yagarbha Supersoul enters into each and every universe and causes it to be animated by begetting the living entities within the womb of the material nature, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.3). After each annihilation of the material creation, all the living entities are merged within the body of the Lord, and after creation they are again impregnated within the material energy. In material existence, therefore, the material energy is seemingly the mother of the living entities, and the Lord is the father. When, however, the animation takes place, the living entities revive their own natural activities under the spell of time and energy, and thus the varieties of living beings are manifested. The Lord, therefore, is ultimately the cause of all animation in the material world."

        "translation": "The br\u0101hma\u1e47as represent His mouth, the k\u1e63atriyas His arms, the vai\u015byas His thighs, and the \u015b\u016bdras are born of His legs.",
        "purport": " All living beings are stated to be the parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and how they are so is explained in this verse. The four divisions of human society, namely the intelligent class (the br\u0101hma\u1e47as), the administrative class (the k\u1e63atriyas), the mercantile class (the vai\u015byas), and the laborer class (the \u015b\u016bdras), are all in different parts of the body of the Lord. As such, no one is different from the Lord. The mouth of the body and the legs of the body are nondifferent constitutionally, but the mouth or the head of the body is qualitatively more important than the legs. At the same time, the mouth, the legs, the arms and the thighs are all component parts of the body. These limbs of the body of the Lord are meant to serve the complete whole. The mouth is meant for speaking and eating, the arms are meant for the protection of the body, the legs are meant for carrying the body, and the waist of the body is meant for maintaining the body. The intelligent class in society, therefore, must speak on behalf of the body, as well as accept foodstuff to satisfy the hunger of the body. The hunger of the Lord is to accept the fruits of sacrifice. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, or the intelligent class, must be very expert in performing such sacrifices, and the subordinate classes must join in such sacrifices. To speak for the Supreme Lord means to glorify the Lord by means of propagating the knowledge of the Lord as it is, broadcasting the factual nature of the Lord and the factual position of all other parts of the whole body. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, therefore, are required to know the Vedas, or the ultimate source of knowledge. Veda means knowledge, and anta means the end of it. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord is the source of everything (aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25), and thus the end of all knowledge (Ved\u0101nta) is to know the Lord, to know our relationship with Him and to act according to that relationship only. The parts of the body are related to the body; similarly, the living being must know his relationship with the Lord. The human life is especially meant for this purpose, namely to know the factual relationship of every living being with the Supreme Lord. Without knowing this relationship, the human life is spoiled. The intelligent class of men, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, are therefore especially responsible for broadcasting this knowledge of our relationship with the Lord and leading the general mass of people to the right path. The administrative class is meant for protecting the living beings so that they can serve this purpose. The mercantile class is meant for producing food grains and distributing them to the complete human society so that the whole population is given a chance to live comfortably and discharge the duties of human life. The mercantile class is also required to give protection to the cows in order to get sufficient milk and milk products, which alone can give the proper health and intelligence to maintain a civilization perfectly meant for knowledge of the ultimate truth. And the laborer class, who are neither intelligent nor powerful, can help by physical services to the other higher classes and thus be benefited by their cooperation. Therefore the universe is a complete unit in relationship with the Lord, and without this relationship with the Lord the whole human society is disturbed and is without any peace and prosperity. This is confirmed in the Vedas: br\u0101hma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019sya mukham \u0101s\u012bd, b\u0101h\u016b r\u0101janya\u1e25 k\u1e5bta\u1e25."

The spiritual planets, however, are eternal.",
        "purport": " Many times in these pages we have discussed the spiritual planets situated beyond the material sky, and the description is corroborated in this verse. The word san\u0101tana is significant. This very idea of eternity is expressed in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.20), where it is said that beyond the material creation is the spiritual sky, where everything is eternal. Sometimes Satyaloka, the planet in which Brahm\u0101 resides, is also called Brahmaloka. But the Brahmaloka mentioned here is not the same as the Satyaloka planetary system. This Brahmaloka is eternal, whereas the Satyaloka planetary system is not eternal. And to distinguish between the two, the adjective san\u0101tana has been used in this case. According to \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, this Brahmaloka is the loka or abode of Brahman, or the Supreme Lord. In the spiritual sky all the planets are as good as the Lord Himself. The Lord is all spirit, and His name, fame, glories, qualities, pastimes, etc., are all nondifferent from Him because He is absolute. As such, the planets in the kingdom of God are also nondifferent from Him. In those planets there is no difference between the body and the soul, nor is there any influence of time as we experience it in the material world. And in addition to there being no influence of time, the planets in Brahmaloka, due to being spiritual, are never annihilated. All variegatedness in the spiritual planets is also one with the Lord, and therefore the Vedic aphorism ekam ev\u0101dvit\u012byam is fully realized in that san\u0101tana atmosphere of spiritual variegatedness. This material world is only a shadow phantasmagoria of the spiritual kingdom of the Lord, and because it is a shadow it is never eternal; the variegatedness in the material world of duality (spirit and matter) cannot be compared to that of the spiritual world. Because of a poor fund of knowledge, less intelligent persons sometimes mistake the conditions of the shadow world to be equivalent to those of the spiritual world, and thus they mistake the Lord and His pastimes in the material world to be one with the conditioned souls and their activities. The Lord condemns such less intelligent persons in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11): Whenever the Lord incarnates, He does so in His full internal potency (\u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101), and less intelligent persons mistake Him to be one of the material creations. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, therefore, rightly commenting on this verse, says that the Brahmaloka mentioned here is Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, the kingdom of God, which is san\u0101tana, or eternal, and is therefore not exactly like the material creations described above. The vir\u0101\u1e6d universal form of the Lord is an imagination for the material world. It has nothing to do with the spiritual world, or the kingdom of God."

The situation is calculated from the earthly planetary system, which is called Bh\u016brloka. Above Bh\u016brloka is Bhuvarloka, and the topmost planetary system is called Satyaloka. These are the upper seven lokas, or planetary systems. And similarly there are seven lower planetary systems, known as Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Tal\u0101tala, Mah\u0101tala, Ras\u0101tala and P\u0101t\u0101la lokas. All these planetary systems are scattered over the complete universe, which occupies an area of two billion times two billion square miles. The modern astronauts can travel only a few thousand miles away from the earth, and therefore their attempt to travel in the sky is something like child\u2019s play on the shore of an expansive ocean. The moon is situated in the third status of the upper planetary system, and in the Fifth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam we shall be able to know the distant situation of the various planets scattered over the vast material sky. There are innumerable universes beyond the one in which we are put, and all these material universes cover only an insignificant portion of the spiritual sky, which is described above as san\u0101tana Brahmaloka. The Supreme Lord very kindly invites the intelligent human beings to return home, back to Godhead, in the following verse of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.16): Beginning from Satyaloka, the topmost planet of the universe, situated just below the eternal Brahmaloka, as described above, all the planets are material. And one\u2019s situation in any of the many material planets is still subject to the laws of material nature, namely birth, death, old age and disease. But one can get complete liberation from all the above-mentioned material pangs when one enters into the eternal Brahmaloka san\u0101tana atmosphere, the kingdom of God. Therefore liberation, as contemplated by the speculative philosophers and the mystics, is possible only when one becomes a devotee of the Lord. Anyone who is not a devotee cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Only by attainment of a service attitude in the transcendental position can one enter into the kingdom of Godhead. Therefore the speculative philosophers, as well as the mystics, must first of all be attracted to the devotional cult before they can factually attain liberation."
