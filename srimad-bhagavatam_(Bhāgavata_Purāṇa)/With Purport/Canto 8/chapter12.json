In other words, they are not concerned with dharma (religiosity), artha (economic development), or k\u0101ma (sense gratification). The only concern of such devotees is mok\u1e63a, liberation. This mok\u1e63a does not refer to becoming one with the Supreme like the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu explained that real mok\u1e63a means taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. The Lord clearly explained this fact while instructing S\u0101rvabhauma Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101c\u0101rya. S\u0101rvabhauma Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101c\u0101rya wanted to correct the word mukti-pade in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, but Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu informed him that there is no need to correct any word in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. He explained that mukti-pade refers to the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who offers mukti and is therefore called Mukunda. A pure devotee is not concerned with material things. He is not concerned with religiosity, economic development or sense gratification. He is interested only in serving the lotus feet of the Lord."

Being completely spiritual, You are eternal, free from the material modes of nature, and full of transcendental bliss. Indeed, for You there is no question of lamentation. Since You are the supreme cause, the cause of all causes, nothing can exist without You. Yet we are different from You in a relationship of cause and effect, for in one sense the cause and effect are different. You are the original cause of creation, manifestation and annihilation, and You bestow benedictions upon all living entities.

All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.\u201d This explains the philosophy of simultaneous oneness and difference, known as acintya-bhed\u0101bheda. Everything is the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, yet the Supreme Person is differently situated from everything. Indeed, because the Lord is differently situated from everything material, He is the Supreme Brahman, the supreme cause, the supreme controller. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25. The Lord is the supreme cause, and His form has nothing to do with the material modes of nature. The devotee prays: \u201cAs Your devotee is completely free from all desires, Your Lordship is also completely free from desires. You are fully independent. Although all living entities engage in Your service, You do not depend on the service of anyone. Although this material world is created complete by You, everything depends on Your sanction. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca: remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness come from You. Nothing can be done independently, yet You act independently of the service rendered by Your servants. The living entities depend on Your mercy for liberation, but when You want to give them liberation, You do not depend on anyone else. Indeed, by Your causeless mercy, You can give liberation to anyone. Those who receive Your mercy are called k\u1e5bp\u0101-siddha. To reach the platform of perfection takes many, many lives (bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate). Nonetheless, even without undergoing severe austerities, one can attain perfection by Your mercy. Devotional service should be unmotivated and free from impediments (ahaituky apratihat\u0101 yay\u0101tm\u0101 supras\u012bdati). This is the position of nir\u0101\u015bi\u1e63a\u1e25, or freedom from expectations for results. A pure devotee continuously offers transcendental loving service to You, but You may nonetheless offer mercy to anyone, without depending on his service.\u201d"

As there is no difference between the gold of a golden ornament and the gold in a mine, there is no difference between cause and effect; both of them are the same. Only because of ignorance do people concoct differences and dualities. You are free from material contamination, and since the entire cosmos is caused by You and cannot exist without You, it is an effect of Your transcendental qualities. Thus the conception that Brahman is true and the world false cannot be maintained.",
        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that the living entities are representations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s marginal potency whereas the various bodies accepted by the living entities are products of the material energy. Thus the body is considered material, and the soul is considered spiritual. The origin of them both, however, is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord explains in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.4-5): \u201cEarth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego \u2014 all together these eight comprise My separated material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.\u201d Thus both matter and the living entities are manifestations of energy of the Supreme Lord. Since the energy and the energetic are not different and since the material and marginal energies are both energies of the supreme energetic, the Supreme Lord, ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead is everything. In this regard, the example may be given of gold that has not been molded and gold that has been molded into various ornaments. A gold earring and the gold in a mine are different only as cause and effect; otherwise they are the same. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra describes that Brahman is the cause of everything. Janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25. Everything is born of the Supreme Brahman, from which everything emanates as different energies. None of these energies, therefore, should be considered false. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs\u2019 differentiation between Brahman and m\u0101y\u0101 is only due to ignorance. \u015ar\u012bmad V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya, in his Bh\u0101gavata-candra-candrik\u0101, describes the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy as follows. The cosmic manifestation is described as sat and asat, as cit and acit. Matter is acit, and the living force is cit, but their origin is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in whom there is no difference between matter and spirit. According to this conception, the cosmic manifestation, consisting of both matter and spirit, is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ida\u1e41 hi vi\u015bva\u1e41 bhagav\u0101n ivetara\u1e25: \u201cThis cosmic manifestation is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although it appears different from Him.\u201d In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.4) the Lord says: \u201cBy Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.\u201d Thus although someone may say that the Supreme Person is different from the cosmic manifestation, actually He is not. The Lord says, may\u0101 tatam ida\u1e41 sarvam: \u201cIn My impersonal feature I am spread throughout the world.\u201d Therefore, this world is not different from Him. The difference is a difference in names. For example, whether we speak of gold earrings, gold bangles or gold necklaces, ultimately they are all gold. In a similar way, all the different manifestations of matter and spirit are ultimately one in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. ekam ev\u0101dvit\u012bya\u1e41 brahma. This is the Vedic version (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 6.2.1). There is oneness because everything emanates from the Supreme Brahman. The example already given is that there is no difference between a golden earring and the gold mine as it is. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers, however, because of their M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da conception, create differences. They say, brahma satya\u1e41 jagan mithy\u0101: \u201cThe Absolute Truth is real, and the cosmic manifestation is false.\u201d But why should the jagat be considered mithy\u0101? The jagat is an emanation from Brahman. Therefore the jagat is also truth. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, therefore, do not consider the jagat to be mithy\u0101; rather, they regard everything as reality in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u201cThings should be accepted for the Lord\u2019s service and not for one\u2019s personal sense gratification. If one accepts something without attachment and accepts it because it is related to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one\u2019s renunciation is called yukta\u1e41 vair\u0101gyam. Whatever is favorable for the rendering of service to the Lord should be accepted and should not be rejected as a material thing.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.255-256) The jagat should not be rejected as mithy\u0101. It is truth, and the truth is realized when everything is engaged in the service of the Lord. A flower accepted for one\u2019s sense gratification is material, but when the same flower is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a devotee, it is spiritual. Food taken and cooked for oneself is material, but food cooked for the Supreme Lord is spiritual pras\u0101da. This is a question of realization. Actually, everything is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore everything is spiritual, but those who are not advanced in proper knowledge make distinctions because of the interactions of the three modes of material nature. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that although the sun is the only light, the sunshine, which is exhibited in seven colors, and darkness, which is the absence of sunshine, are not different from the sun, for without the existence of the sun such differentiations cannot exist. There may be varied nomenclature because of different conditions, but they are all the sun. The Pur\u0101\u1e47as therefore say: \u201cJust as the illumination of a fire, which is situated in one place, is spread all over, the energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Parabrahman, are spread all over this universe.\u201d (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 1.22.53) Materially, we can directly perceive the sunshine spreading itself according to different names and activities, but ultimately the sun is one. Similarly, sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma: everything is an expansion of the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, the Supreme Lord is everything, and He is one without differentiation. There is no existence separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "translation": "O my Lord, I, who am considered to be the best of the demigods, and Lord Brahm\u0101 and the great \u1e5b\u1e63is, headed by Mar\u012bci, are born of the mode of goodness. Nonetheless, we are bewildered by Your illusory energy and cannot understand what this creation is. Aside from us, what is to be said of others, like the demons and human beings, who are in the base modes of material nature [rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a]? How will they know You?",
        "purport": " Factually speaking, even those who are situated in the material mode of goodness cannot understand the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. What then is to be said of those who are situated in rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a, the base qualities of material nature? How can we even imagine the Supreme Personality of Godhead? There are so many philosophers trying to understand the Absolute Truth, but since they are situated in the base qualities of material nature and are addicted to so many bad habits, like drinking, meat-eating, illicit sex and gambling, how can they conceive of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? For them it is impossible. For the present day, the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b-vidhi as enunciated by N\u0101rada Muni is the only hope. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, therefore, has quoted the following verse from the Brahma-y\u0101mala: \u201cDevotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upani\u1e63ads, Pur\u0101\u1e47as and N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.101) Those who are very advanced in knowledge and are situated in the mode of goodness follow the Vedic instructions of the \u015bruti and sm\u1e5bti and other religious scriptures, including the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b-vidhi. Without understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this way, one only creates a disturbance. In this Age of Kali, so many gurus have sprung up, and because they do not refer to the \u015bruti-sm\u1e5bti-pur\u0101\u1e47\u0101di-p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trika-vidhi, they are creating a great disturbance in the world in regard to understanding the Absolute Truth. However, those who follow the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b-vidhi under the guidance of a proper spiritual master can understand the Absolute Truth. It is said, pa\u00f1car\u0101trasya k\u1e5btsnasya vakt\u0101 tu bhagav\u0101n svayam: the pa\u00f1car\u0101tra system is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just like Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. V\u0101sudeva-\u015bara\u1e47\u0101 vidur a\u00f1jasaiva: the truth can be understood only by one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva. \u201cAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.\u201d (Bg. 7.19) Only those who have surrendered to the lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva can understand the Absolute Truth. \u201cBy rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.7) Therefore, V\u0101sudeva, Bhagav\u0101n \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, personally teaches in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.\u201d (Bg. 18.66) \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.\u201d (Bg. 18.55) The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not properly understood even by Lord \u015aiva or Lord Brahm\u0101, what to speak of others, but He can be understood by the process of bhakti-yoga. If one practices bhakti-yoga by taking shelter of V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, simply by hearing V\u0101sudeva speak about Himself, one can understand everything about Him. Indeed, one can understand Him completely (samagram)."

In other words, those who maintain a demoniac mentality are bewildered by the beauty of a woman, but those who are advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or even those on the platform of goodness, are not bewildered. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knew that because Lord \u015aiva is not an ordinary person, he cannot be bewildered even by the most beautiful woman. Cupid himself tried to invoke Lord \u015aiva\u2019s lusty desires in the presence of P\u0101rvat\u012b, but Lord \u015aiva was never agitated. Rather, the blazing fire from Lord \u015aiva\u2019s eyes turned Cupid to ashes. Therefore, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u had to think twice about what kind of beautiful form would bewilder even Lord \u015aiva. Consequently He was smiling gravely, as stated in the previous verse (prahasya bh\u0101va-gambh\u012bram). A beautiful woman generally cannot induce Lord \u015aiva to be lusty, but Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u was considering whether there was any form of woman who could enchant him."

Such are the affairs that began when Lord \u015aiva observed the beautiful girl playing with the ball. In such activities, the influence of Cupid is very prominent. As both parties move their eyebrows and glance at one another, their lusty desires increase more and more. Such reciprocations of lusty desire took place between Lord \u015aiva and the beautiful woman, even though Um\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva\u2019s associates were by Lord \u015aiva\u2019s side. Such is the attraction between man and woman in the material world. Lord \u015aiva was supposed to be above all this attraction, but he was victimized by the captivating power of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva thus explains the nature of lusty attraction: \u201cThe attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence. On the basis of this misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one increases life\u2019s illusions and thinks in terms of\u00a0\u2018I and mine.\u2019\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.5.8) When a man and woman exchange feelings of lust, both of them are victimized, and thus they are bound to this material world in various ways."

As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.22), yasmin sthito na du\u1e25khena guru\u1e47\u0101pi vic\u0101lyate: because of his full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee is never agitated, even in the greatest trials. This pridelessness is possible only for the first-class devotees, of whom Lord \u015aambhu is one."

I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.\u201d This partiality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is natural. A person cares for his children not because of partiality but in a reciprocation of love. The children depend on the father\u2019s affection, and the father affectionately maintains the children. Similarly, because devotees do not know anything but the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord is always prepared to give protection to His devotees and fulfill their desires. He therefore says, kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.\u201d"
