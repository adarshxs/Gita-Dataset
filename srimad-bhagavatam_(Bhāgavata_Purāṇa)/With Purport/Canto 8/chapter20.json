        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks that Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja remained silent at a critical point. How could he disobey the instruction of \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, his spiritual master? It is the duty of such a sober personality as Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to abide by the orders of his spiritual master immediately, as his spiritual master had advised. But Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja also considered that \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya was no longer to be accepted as a spiritual master, for he had deviated from the duty of a spiritual master. According to \u015b\u0101stra, the duty of the guru is to take the disciple back home, back to Godhead. If he is unable to do so and instead hinders the disciple in going back to Godhead, he should not be a guru. Gurur na sa sy\u0101t (Bh\u0101g. 5.5.18). One should not become a guru if he cannot enable his disciple to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The goal of life is to become a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that one may be freed from the bondage of material existence (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti mam eti so\u00a0\u2019rjuna). The spiritual master helps the disciple attain this stage by developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Now \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya has advised Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to deny the promise to V\u0101manadeva. Under the circumstances, therefore, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja thought that there would be no fault if he disobeyed the order of his spiritual master. He deliberated on this point \u2014 should he refuse to accept the advice of his spiritual master, or should he independently do everything to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead? He took some time. Therefore it is said, t\u016b\u1e63\u1e47\u012b\u1e41 bh\u016btv\u0101 k\u1e63a\u1e47a\u1e41 rajann uv\u0101c\u0101vahito gurum. After deliberating on this point, he decided that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u should be pleased in all circumstances, even at the risk of ignoring the guru\u2019s advice to the contrary. Anyone who is supposed to be a guru but who goes against the principle of vi\u1e63\u1e47u-bhakti cannot be accepted as guru. If one has falsely accepted such a guru, one should reject him. Such a guru is described as follows (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Udyoga 179.25): \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has advised that such a useless guru, a family priest acting as guru, should be given up, and that the proper, bona fide guru should be accepted. \u201cA scholarly br\u0101hma\u1e47a expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, but if a person born in a family of a lower caste is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he can become a spiritual master.\u201d (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a)"

        "purport": " Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s grave answer to \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya is meaningful. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya stressed that one\u2019s material means of livelihood and one\u2019s material reputation, sense gratification and economic development must continue properly. To see to this is the first duty of a man who is a householder, especially one who is interested in material affairs. If a religious principle does not affect one\u2019s material condition, it is to be accepted. At the present time, in this Age of Kali, this idea is extremely prominent. No one is prepared to accept any religious principle if it hampers material prosperity. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, being a person of this material world, did not know the principles of a devotee. A devotee is determined to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His full satisfaction. Anything that hampers such determination should certainly be rejected. This is the principle of bhakti. \u0100nuk\u016blyasya sa\u1e45kalpa\u1e25 pr\u0101tik\u016blyasya varjanam (Cc. Madhya 22.100). To perform devotional service, one must accept only that which is favorable and reject that which is unfavorable. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had the opportunity to contribute everything he possessed to the lotus feet of Lord V\u0101manadeva, but \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya was putting forward a material argument to hamper this process of devotional service. Under the circumstances, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja decided that such hindrances should certainly be avoided. In other words, he decided immediately to reject the advice of \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya and go on with his duty. Thus he gave all his possessions to Lord V\u0101manadeva."

        "purport": " Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had already been blessed by his grandfather Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Therefore, he was a pure devotee, although born in a family of demons. There are two kinds of highly elevated devotees, called s\u0101dhana-siddha and k\u1e5bp\u0101-siddha. S\u0101dhana-siddha refers to one who has become a devotee by regular execution of the regulative principles mentioned in the \u015b\u0101stras, as ordered and directed by the spiritual master. If one regularly executes such devotional service, he will certainly attain perfection in due course of time. But there are other devotees, who may not have undergone all the required details of devotional service but who, by the special mercy of guru and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 have immediately attained the perfection of pure devotional service. Examples of such devotees are the yaj\u00f1a-patn\u012bs, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bali and \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. The yaj\u00f1a-patn\u012bs were the wives of ordinary br\u0101hma\u1e47as engaged in fruitive activities. Although the br\u0101hma\u1e47as were very learned and advanced in Vedic knowledge, they could not achieve the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-Balar\u0101ma, whereas their wives achieved complete perfection in devotional service, despite their being women. Similarly, Vairocani, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, received the mercy of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s mercy he also received the mercy of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who appeared before him as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b beggar. Thus Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja became a k\u1e5bp\u0101-siddha because of the special mercy of both guru and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu confirms this favor: guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja (Cc. Madhya 19.151). Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, by the grace of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, got the seed of devotional service, and when that seed developed, he achieved the ultimate fruit of that service, namely love of Godhead (prem\u0101 pum-artho mah\u0101n), immediately upon the appearance of Lord V\u0101manadeva. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja regularly maintained devotion for the Lord, and because he was purified, the Lord appeared before him. Because of unalloyed love for the Lord, he then immediately decided, \u201cI shall give this little dwarf br\u0101hma\u1e47a whatever He asks from me.\u201d This is a sign of love. Thus Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is understood to be one who received the highest perfection of devotional service by special mercy."

Certainly one has attachment for everything material, especially one\u2019s land, but land and other possessions are forcibly taken away at the time of death, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (m\u1e5btyu\u1e25 sarva-hara\u015b c\u0101ham). The Lord personally appeared to Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to take away everything he had, and thus he was so fortunate that he could see the Lord face to face. Nondevotees, however, cannot see the Lord face to face; to such persons the Lord appears as death and takes away all their possessions by force. Under the circumstances, why should we not part with our possessions and deliver them to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u for His satisfaction? \u015ar\u012b C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita says in this regard, san-nimitte vara\u1e41 ty\u0101go vin\u0101\u015be niyate sati (C\u0101\u1e47akya-\u015bloka 36).

The Vedic principles of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution are meant to organize society to prepare everyone to worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is worshiped by the proper execution of prescribed duties in the system of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama.

He was never to be misguided by anyone, even by a person who happened to be his so-called spiritual master. This is the sign of full surrender. Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura said: When one surrenders to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, one must be prepared to abide by His orders in all circumstances, whether He kills one or gives one protection.

Thus \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya was never inspired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to develop in devotional service. As stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d Devotees who actually engage in devotional service with faith and love are inspired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Although the Supreme Lord is situated in the core of everyone\u2019s heart, unless one is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, unless one is engaged in devotional service, one does not get sound advice by which to return home, back to Godhead. Such instructions are meant only for devotees. Therefore in this verse the word daiva-prahita\u1e25, \u201cbeing inspired by the Supreme Lord,\u201d is important. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya should have encouraged Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to give everything to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This would have been a sign of love for the Supreme Lord. But he did not do so. On the contrary, he wanted to punish his devoted disciple by cursing him."

Actually, no one can give anything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He is full in everything. Sometimes we see a devotee offering Ganges water to the Ganges. After taking his bath in the Ganges, a devotee takes a palmful of water and offers it back to the Ganges. Actually, when one takes a palmful of water from the Ganges, the Ganges does not lose anything, and similarly if a devotee offers a palmful of water to the Ganges, the Ganges does not increase in any way. But by such an offering, the devotee becomes celebrated as a devotee of mother Ganges. Similarly, when we offer anything with devotion and faith, what we offer does not belong to us, nor does it enrich the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But if one offers whatever he has in his possession, he becomes a recognized devotee. In this regard, the example is given that when one\u2019s face is decorated with a garland and sandalwood pulp, the reflection of one\u2019s face in a mirror automatically becomes beautiful. The original source of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is our original source also. Therefore when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is decorated, the devotees and all living entities are decorated automatically."

M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers think that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, has become everything, He has no separate existence. Their philosophy is called advaita-v\u0101da. Actually, however, their philosophy is not correct. Here, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the seer of the Personality of Godhead\u2019s universal body, and that body was that which was seen. Thus there is dvaita-v\u0101da; there are always two entities \u2014 the seer and the seen. The seer is a part of the whole, but he is not equal to the whole. The part of the whole, the seer, is also one with the whole, but since he is but a part, he cannot be the complete whole at any time. This acintya-bhed\u0101bheda \u2014 simultaneous oneness and difference \u2014 is the perfect philosophy propounded by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu."

From His words came all the Vedic mantras, on His tongue was the demigod of water, Varu\u1e47adeva, on His eyebrows were the regulative principles, and on His eyelids were day and night. [When His eyes were open it was daytime, and when they were closed it was night.] On His forehead was anger, and on His lips was greed. O King, in His touch were lusty desires, in His semen were all the waters, on His back was irreligion, and in His wonderful activities or steps was the fire of sacrifice. On His shadow was death, in His smile was the illusory energy, and on the hairs of His body were all the drugs and herbs. In His veins were all the rivers, on His nails were all the stones, in His intelligence were Lord Brahm\u0101, the demigods and the great saintly persons, and throughout His entire body and senses were all living entities, moving and stationary. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja thus saw everything in the gigantic body of the Lord.",

From this hole, the water of the Ganges infiltrated into this material world, and therefore it is said, pada-nakha-n\u012bra janita jana-p\u0101vana (Da\u015b\u0101vat\u0101ra-stotra 5).
