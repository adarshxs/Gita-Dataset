        "purport": " The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.6): \u201cAlthough I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.\u201d In the following verse in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.7), the Lord says: \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself.\u201d Thus although the Supreme Lord is unborn, there is no cessation to His appearance in different forms as incarnations like Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord R\u0101ma. Since His incarnations are eternal, the various activities performed by these incarnations are also eternal. The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not appear because He is forced to do so by karma like ordinary living entities who are forced to accept a certain type of body. It is to be understood that the Lord\u2019s body and activities are all transcendental, being free from the contamination of the material modes of nature. These pastimes are transcendental bliss to the Lord. The word apariga\u1e47ya-dh\u0101mne is very significant. There is no limit to the Lord\u2019s appearance in different incarnations. All of these incarnations are eternal, blissful and full of knowledge."

When the devotee sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his meditation, or when he sees the Lord personally, face to face, he becomes aware of everything within this universe. Indeed, nothing is unknown to him. Everything within this material world is fully manifested to a devotee who has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Those who are pious all affirm this.",
        "purport": " Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is nirgu\u1e47a, not to be found within this material world, the entire material world is pervaded by Him, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (may\u0101 tatam ida\u1e41 sarvam). The material world is nothing but an expansion of the Lord\u2019s material energy, and the entire cosmic manifestation rests upon Him (mat-sth\u0101ni sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni). Nonetheless, the Supreme Lord cannot be found here (na c\u0101ha\u1e41 te\u1e63v avasthita\u1e25). A devotee, however, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the practice of bhakti-yoga. One ordinarily does not begin to practice bhakti-yoga unless he has practiced it in previous births. Moreover, one can begin bhakti-yoga only by the mercy of the spiritual master and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja. The seed of devotional service is obtainable by the mercy of guru, the spiritual master, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Only by the practice of bhakti-yoga can one achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and see Him face to face (prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa\u1e25 sadaiva h\u1e5bdaye\u1e63u vilokayanti). One cannot see the Lord by other methods, such as karma, j\u00f1\u0101na or yoga. Under the direction of the spiritual master, one must cultivate bhakti-yoga (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam). Then, even within this material world, although the Lord is not visible, a devotee can see Him. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25) and in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (bhakty\u0101ham ekay\u0101 gr\u0101hya\u1e25). Thus by devotional service one can achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although He is not visible or understandable to materialistic persons. In this verse, the cultivation of bhakti-yoga is compared to many material activities. By friction one can get fire from wood, by digging the earth one can get food grains and water, and by agitating the milk bag of the cow one can get nectarean milk. Milk is compared to nectar, which one can drink to become immortal. Of course, simply drinking milk will not make one immortal, but it can increase the duration of one\u2019s life. In modern civilization, men do not think milk to be important, and therefore they do not live very long. Although in this age men can live up to one hundred years, their duration of life is reduced because they do not drink large quantities of milk. This is a sign of Kali-yuga. In Kali-yuga, instead of drinking milk, people prefer to slaughter an animal and eat its flesh. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, advises go-rak\u1e63ya, which means cow protection. The cow should be protected, milk should be drawn from the cows, and this milk should be prepared in various ways. One should take ample milk, and thus one can prolong one\u2019s life, develop his brain, execute devotional service, and ultimately attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is essential to get food grains and water by digging the earth, it is also essential to give protection to the cows and take nectarean milk from their milk bags. The people of this age are inclined toward industrial enterprises for comfortable living, but they refuse to endeavor to execute devotional service, by which they can achieve the ultimate goal of life by returning home, back to Godhead. Unfortunately, as it is said, na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e41 dur\u0101\u015bay\u0101 ye bahir-artha-m\u0101nina\u1e25. People without spiritual education do not know that the ultimate goal of life is to go back home, back to Godhead. Forgetting this aim of life, they are working very hard in disappointment and frustration (mogh\u0101\u015b\u0101 mogha-karm\u0101\u1e47o mogha j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101 vicetasa\u1e25). The so-called vai\u015byas \u2014 the industrialists or businessmen \u2014 are involved in big, big industrial enterprises, but they are not interested in food grains and milk. However, as indicated here, by digging for water, even in the desert, we can produce food grains; when we produce food grains and vegetables, we can give protection to the cows; while giving protection to the cows, we can draw from them abundant quantities of milk; and by getting enough milk and combining it with food grains and vegetables, we can prepare hundreds of nectarean foods. We can happily eat this food and thus avoid industrial enterprises and joblessness. Agriculture and cow protection are the way to become sinless and thus be attracted to devotional service. Those who are sinful cannot be attracted by devotional service. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.28): \u201cPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination.\u201d The majority of people in this Age of Kali are sinful, short-living, unfortunate and disturbed (mand\u0101\u1e25 sumanda-matayo manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101 hy upadrut\u0101\u1e25). For them, Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has advised: \u201cIn this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.\u201d"

The devotee is always eager to see the Lord face to face, but if he is brokenhearted because he cannot see the Lord, even life after life, he will never command the Lord to appear. This is a sign of pure devotion. Therefore in this verse we find the word ati-cira-\u012bpsita-artham, meaning that the devotee aspires for a long, long time to see the Lord. If the Lord, by His own pleasure, appears before the devotee, the devotee feels extremely happy, as Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja felt when he personally saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja saw the Lord, he had no desire to ask the Lord for any benediction. Indeed, simply by seeing the Lord, Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja felt so satisfied that he did not want to ask the Lord for any benediction (sv\u0101min k\u1e5bt\u0101rtho\u00a0\u2019smi vara\u1e41 na y\u0101ce).

The word mantra means \u201cthat which delivers one from the material world.\u201d Only the dvijas (the br\u0101hma\u1e47as) and the devas (the demigods) can be delivered from material existence by the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whatever is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a mantra and is suitable for delivering the conditioned souls from mental speculation. The conditioned souls are engaged in a struggle for existence (mana\u1e25 \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u012bndriy\u0101\u1e47i prak\u1e5bti-sth\u0101ni kar\u1e63ati). Deliverance from this struggle constitutes the highest benefit, but unless one gets a mantra from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, deliverance is impossible. The beginning mantra is the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra. Therefore, after purification, when one is qualified to become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a (dvija), he is offered the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra. Simply by chanting the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra, one can be delivered. This mantra, however, is suitable only for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and demigods. In Kali-yuga, we are all in a very difficult position, in which we need a suitable mantra that can deliver us from the dangers of this age. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His incarnation as Lord Caitanya, gives us the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. \u201cIn this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way.

We cannot invent any means to be delivered from the dangers of material existence. Here, even the demigods, such as Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, and the praj\u0101patis, such as Dak\u1e63a, are said to be like illuminating sparks in the presence of the Supreme Lord, who is compared to a great fire. Sparks are beautiful as long as they are in the fire. Similarly, we have to remain in the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and always engage in devotional service, for then we shall always be brilliant and illuminating. As soon as we fall from the service of the Lord, our brilliance and illumination will immediately be extinguished, or at least stopped for some time. When we living entities, who are like sparks of the original fire, the Supreme Lord, fall into a material condition, we must take the mantra from the Supreme Personality of Godhead as it is offered by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. By chanting this Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, we shall be delivered from all the difficulties of this material world."

        "purport": " Here is proof of the omnipotence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is above everyone. There are two classes of living entities \u2014 the demons and the demigods \u2014 and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is above them both. The demons believe in the \u201cchance\u201d theory of creation, whereas the demigods believe in creation by the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The omnipotence of the Supreme Lord is proved here, for simply with one hand He lifted Mandara Mountain, the demigods and the demons, placed them on the back of Garu\u1e0da and brought them to the Ocean of Milk. Now, the demigods, the devotees, would immediately accept this incident, knowing that the Lord can lift anything, however heavy it might be. But although demons were also carried along with the demigods, demons, upon hearing of this incident, would say that it is mythological. But if God is all-powerful, why would it be difficult for Him to lift a mountain? Since He is floating innumerable planets with many hundreds and thousands of Mandara Mountains, why can\u2019t He lift one of them with His hand? This is not mythology, but the difference between the believers and the faithless is that the devotees accept the incidents mentioned in the Vedic literatures to be true, whereas the demons simply argue and label all these historical incidents mythology. Demons would prefer to explain that everything happening in the cosmic manifestation takes place by chance, but demigods, or devotees, never consider anything to be chance. Rather, they know that everything is an arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the difference between the demigods and the demons."

        "purport": " Garu\u1e0da was asked by the Lord to leave that place because the snake V\u0101suki, who was to be used as the rope for churning, could not go there in the presence of Garu\u1e0da. Garu\u1e0da, the carrier of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is not a vegetarian. He eats big snakes. V\u0101suki, being a great snake, would be natural food for Garu\u1e0da, the chief of birds. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u therefore asked Garu\u1e0da to leave so that V\u0101suki could be brought to churn the ocean with Mandara Mountain, which was to be used as the churning rod. These are the wonderful arrangements of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nothing takes place by accident. Carrying Mandara Mountain on the back of a bird and putting it in its right position might be difficult for anyone, whether demigod or demon, but for the Supreme Personality of Godhead everything is possible, as shown by this pastime. The Lord had no difficulty lifting the mountain with one hand, and Garu\u1e0da, His carrier, carried all the demons and demigods together by the grace of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is known as Yoge\u015bvara, the master of all mystic power, because of His omnipotence. If He likes, He can make anything lighter than cotton or heavier than the universe. Those who do not believe in the activities of the Lord cannot explain how things happen. Using words like \u201caccident,\u201d they take shelter of ideas that are unbelievable. Nothing is accidental. Everything is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10). May\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sacar\u0101caram. Whatever actions and reactions occur within the cosmic manifestation all take place under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, because the demons do not understand the potency of the Lord, when wonderful things are done, the demons think that they are accidental."
