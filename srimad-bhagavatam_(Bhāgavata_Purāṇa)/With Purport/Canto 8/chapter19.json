Your statements are very true, and they completely agree with religious etiquette. They are in keeping with the behavior of your family, and they enhance your reputation.",
        "purport": " Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is a vivid example of a pure devotee. Someone might argue that since Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, even though very old, was attached to his family, and specifically to his grandson Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, how could he be an ideal example? Therefore this verse uses the word pra\u015b\u0101nta\u1e25. A devotee is always sober. He is never disturbed by any conditions. Even if a devotee remains in g\u1e5bhastha life and does not renounce material possessions, he should still be understood to be pra\u015b\u0101nta, sober, because of his pure devotion to the Lord. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore said: \u201cWhether one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a sanny\u0101s\u012b or a \u015b\u016bdra \u2014 regardless of what he is \u2014 he can become a spiritual master if he knows the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d (Cc. Madhya 8.128) Anyone completely aware of the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, regardless of his status in life, is a guru. Thus Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is a guru in all circumstances. Here His Lordship V\u0101manadeva also teaches sanny\u0101s\u012bs and brahmac\u0101r\u012bs that one should not ask more than necessary. He wanted only three paces of land, although Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted to give Him anything He wanted."

Na j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 kad\u0101cit: \u201cFor the soul there is never birth or death.\u201d This is the statement of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.20). Even the ordinary living entity never takes birth or dies. What then is to be said of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the chief of all living entities? He certainly never takes birth or dies. Ajo \u2019pi sann avyay\u0101tm\u0101 (Bg. 4.6). Both the Lord and the living entity exist as unborn and inexhaustible personalities. Thus Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s conclusion that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u was dead was wrong. As indicated by the words yato n\u0101vartate pum\u0101n, there is certainly a spiritual kingdom, and if the living entity goes there, he never returns to this material world. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so \u2019rjuna. Materially speaking, every living entity dies; death is inevitable. But those who are karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs return to this material world after death, whereas bhaktas do not. Of course, if a bhakta is not completely perfect he takes birth in the material world again, but in a very exalted position, either in a rich family or a family of the purest br\u0101hma\u1e47as (\u015buc\u012bn\u0101m \u015br\u012bmat\u0101\u1e41 gehe), just to finish his development in spiritual consciousness. Those who have completed the course of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and are free from material desire return to the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante tad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama). Here the same fact is stated: yato n\u0101vartate pum\u0101n. Any person who goes back home, back to Godhead, does not return to this material world."

Lord V\u0101manadeva had approached Bali not for His personal welfare but for the welfare of His devotees. Devotees sacrifice all personal interests to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and similarly the Supreme Lord, although having no personal interests, can do anything for the interests of His devotees. One who is full in himself has no personal interests."

        "translation": "The Personality of Godhead said: O my dear King, even the entirety of whatever there may be within the three worlds to satisfy one\u2019s senses cannot satisfy a person whose senses are uncontrolled.",
        "purport": " The material world is an illusory energy to deviate the living entities from the path of self-realization. Anyone who is in this material world is extremely anxious to get more and more things for sense gratification. Actually, however, the purpose of life is not sense gratification but self-realization. Therefore, those who are too addicted to sense gratification are advised to practice the mystic yoga system, or a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga system, consisting of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra and so on. In this way, one can control the senses. The purpose of controlling the senses is to stop one\u2019s implication in the cycle of birth and death. As stated by \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva: \u201cWhen a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful activity. He does not know that due to his past misdeeds he has already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his misery. Actually the living entity should not have taken on a material body, but he has been awarded the material body for sense gratification. Therefore I think it not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in the activities of sense gratification, by which he perpetually gets material bodies one after another.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.5.4) Thus according to \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva the human beings in this material world are just like madmen engaged in activities which they should not perform but which they do perform only for sense gratification. Such activities are not good because in this way one creates another body for his next life, as punishment for his nefarious activities. And as soon as he gets another material body, he is put into repeated suffering in material existence. Therefore the Vedic culture or brahminical culture teaches one how to be satisfied with possessing the minimum necessities in life. To teach this highest culture, var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma is recommended. The aim of the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama divisions \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, \u015b\u016bdra, brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa \u2014 is to train one to control the senses and be content with the bare necessities. Here Lord V\u0101manadeva, as an ideal brahmac\u0101r\u012b, refuses Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s offer to give Him anything He might want. He says that without contentment one could not be happy even if he possessed the property of the entire world or the entire universe. In human society, therefore, the brahminical culture, k\u1e63atriya culture and vai\u015bya culture must be maintained, and people must be taught how to be satisfied with only what they need. In modern civilization there is no such education; everyone tries to possess more and more, and everyone is dissatisfied and unhappy. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore establishing various farms, especially in America, to show how to be happy and content with minimum necessities of life and to save time for self-realization, which one can very easily achieve by chanting the mah\u0101-mantra \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."

        "translation": "One should be satisfied with whatever he achieves by his previous destiny, for discontent can never bring happiness. A person who is not self-controlled will not be happy even with possessing the three worlds.",
        "purport": " If happiness is the ultimate goal of life, one must be satisfied with the position in which he is placed by providence. This instruction is also given by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja: \u201cMy dear friends born of demoniac families, the happiness perceived with reference to the sense objects by contact with the body can be obtained in any form of life, according to one\u2019s past fruitive activities. Such happiness is automatically obtained without endeavor, just as we obtain distress.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 7.6.3) This philosophy is perfect in regard to obtaining happiness. Real happiness is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.21): \u201cIn the spiritually joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth.\u201d One has to perceive happiness by the supersenses. The supersenses are not the senses of the material elements. Every one of us is a spiritual being (aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi), and every one of us is an individual person. Our senses are now covered by material elements, and because of ignorance we consider the material senses that cover us to be our real senses. The real senses, however, are within the material covering. Dehino \u2019smin yath\u0101 dehe: within the covering of the material elements are the spiritual senses. Sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41 tat-paratvena nirmalam: when the spiritual senses are uncovered, by these senses we can be happy. Satisfaction of the spiritual senses is thus described: h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate. When the senses are engaged in devotional service to H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, then the senses are completely satisfied. Without this superior knowledge of sense gratification, one may try to satisfy his material senses, but happiness will never be possible. One may increase his ambition for sense gratification and even achieve what he desires for the gratification of his senses, but because this is on the material platform, he will never achieve satisfaction and contentment. According to brahminical culture, one should be content with whatever he obtains without special endeavor and should cultivate spiritual consciousness. Then he will be happy. The purpose of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is to spread this understanding. People who do not have scientific spiritual knowledge mistakenly think that the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement are escapists trying to avoid material activities. In fact, however, we are engaged in real activities for obtaining the ultimate happiness in life. If one is not trained to satisfy the spiritual senses and continues in material sense gratification, he will never obtain happiness that is eternal and blissful. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.1) therefore recommends: One must practice austerity so that his existential position will be purified and he will achieve unlimited blissful life."

As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.88.8), yasy\u0101ham anug\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101mi hari\u1e63ye tad-dhana\u1e41 \u015banai\u1e25. The Lord said to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, \u201cThe first installment of My mercy toward a devotee is that I take away all his possessions, especially his material opulence, his money.\u201d This is the special favor of the Lord toward a sincere devotee. If a sincere devotee wants K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a above everything but at the same time is attached to material possessions, which hinder his advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, by tactics the Lord takes away all his possessions. Here \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya says that this dwarf brahmac\u0101r\u012b would take away everything. Thus he indicates that the Lord will take away all one\u2019s material possessions and also one\u2019s mind. If one delivers his mind to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25), one can naturally sacrifice everything to satisfy Him. Although Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a devotee, he was attached to material possessions, and therefore the Lord, being very kind to him, showed him special favor by appearing as Lord V\u0101mana to take away all his material possessions, and his mind as well."

A sm\u0101rta-br\u0101hma\u1e47a is always interested in material profit, whereas a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is interested only in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. From the statement of \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, it appears that he was in all respects a sm\u0101rta-br\u0101hma\u1e47a interested only in personal gain."

Even if for the sake of argument the material world is accepted as untruth, the living entity entangled in the illusory energy cannot come out of it without the help of the body. Without the help of the body, one cannot follow a system of religion, nor can one speculate on philosophical perfection. Therefore, the flower and fruit (pu\u1e63pa-phalam) have to be obtained as a result of the body. Without the help of the body, that fruit cannot be gained. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy therefore recommends yukta-vair\u0101gya. It is not that all attention should be diverted for the maintenance of the body, but at the same time one\u2019s bodily maintenance should not be neglected. As long as the body exists one can thoroughly study the Vedic instructions, and thus at the end of life one can achieve perfection.

Especially when one gives charity to a poor man or beggar, one remains unfulfilled in self-realization and in sense gratification.",
        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bali wanted to give everything to V\u0101manadeva, who had appeared as a beggar, but \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, being Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bali\u2019s familial spiritual master in the line of seminal succession, could not appreciate Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bali\u2019s promise. \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya gave Vedic evidence that one should not give everything to a poor man. Rather, when a poor man comes for charity one should untruthfully say, \u201cWhatever I have I have given you. I have no more.\u201d It is not that one should give everything to him. Actually the word om is meant for o\u1e41 tat sat, the Absolute Truth. O\u1e41k\u0101ra is meant for freedom from all attachment to money because money should be spent for the purpose of the Supreme. The tendency of modern civilization is to give money in charity to the poor. Such charity has no spiritual value because we actually see that although there are so many hospitals and other foundations and institutions for the poor, according to the three modes of material nature a class of poor men is always destined to continue. Even though there are so many charitable institutions, poverty has not been driven from human society. Therefore it is recommended here, bhik\u1e63ave sarvam o\u1e41 kurvan n\u0101la\u1e41 k\u0101mena c\u0101tmane. One should not give everything to the beggars among the poor. The best solution is that of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. This movement is always kind to the poor, not only because it feeds them but also because it gives them enlightenment by teaching them how to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. We are therefore opening hundreds and thousands of centers for those who are poor, both in money and in knowledge, to enlighten them in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and reform their character by teaching them how to avoid illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling, which are the most sinful activities and which cause people to suffer, life after life. The best way to use money is to open such a center, where all may come live and reform their character. They may live very comfortably, without denial of any of the body\u2019s necessities, but they live under spiritual control, and thus they live happily and save time for advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one has money, it should not be squandered away on nothing. It should be used to push forward the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement so that all of human society will become happy, prosperous and hopeful of being promoted back home, back to Godhead. The Vedic mantra in this regard reads as follows:"

Although it is a falsehood, it protects one completely, it draws the compassion of others toward oneself, and it gives one full facility to collect money from others for oneself. Nonetheless, if one always pleads that he has nothing, he is condemned, for he is a dead body while living, or while still breathing he should be killed.",

But this is also condemned. If one purposely continues this professional begging, he is supposed to be dead while breathing, or, according to another interpretation, such a man of falsity should be killed while still breathing. The Vedic injunction in this regard is as follows: athaitat p\u016br\u1e47am abhy\u0101tma\u1e41 yan neti sa yat sarva\u1e41 neti br\u016by\u0101t p\u0101pik\u0101sya k\u012brtir j\u0101yate. saina\u1e41 tatraiva hany\u0101t.
