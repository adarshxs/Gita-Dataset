        "purport": " In this verse, the words dharma\u1e25 and san\u0101tana\u1e25 are very important. San\u0101tana means \u201ceternal,\u201d and dharma means \u201coccupational duties.\u201d From Satya-yuga to Kali-yuga, the principles of religion and occupational duty gradually deteriorate. In Satya-yuga, the religious principles are observed in full, without deviation. In Tret\u0101-yuga, however, these principles are somewhat neglected, and only three fourths of the religious duties continue. In Dv\u0101para-yuga only half of the religious principles continue, and in Kali-yuga only one fourth of the religious principles, which gradually disappear. At the end of Kali-yuga, the principles of religion, or the occupational duties of humanity, are almost lost. Indeed, in this Kali-yuga we have passed through only five thousand years, yet the decline of san\u0101tana-dharma is very prominent. The duty of saintly persons, therefore, is to take up seriously the cause of san\u0101tana-dharma and try to reestablish it for the benefit of the entire human society. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has been started according to this principle. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.3.51): The entire Kali-yuga is full of faults. It is like an unlimited ocean of faults. But the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is very authorized. Therefore, following in the footsteps of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who five hundred years ago inaugurated the movement of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-k\u012brtana, we are trying to introduce this movement, according to superior orders, all over the world. Now, if the inaugurators of this movement strictly follow the regulative principles and spread this movement for the benefit of all human society, they will certainly usher in a new way of life by reestablishing san\u0101tana-dharma, the eternal occupational duties of humanity. The eternal occupational duty of the human being is to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. J\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa.\u2019 This is the purport of san\u0101tana-dharma. San\u0101tana means nitya, or \u201ceternal,\u201d and k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-d\u0101sa means \u201cservant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d The eternal occupational duty of the human being is to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the sum and substance of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement."

The rulers of the world in the line of hierarchy execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the parampar\u0101 system. Anyone interested in peaceful life must participate in this parampar\u0101 system and perform yaj\u00f1as. As Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas in the parampar\u0101 system of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, we must perform sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a all over the world (yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25). \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this Age of Kali, and He will be easily satisfied if the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement is spread vigorously all over the world. This will also make people happy without a doubt."
