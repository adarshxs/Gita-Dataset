        "translation": "The leaders of the demons thought it unwise to hold the tail, the inauspicious portion of the snake. Instead, they wanted to hold the front, which had been taken by the Personality of Godhead and the demigods, because that portion was auspicious and glorious. Thus the demons, on the plea that they were all highly advanced students of Vedic knowledge and were all famous for their birth and activities, protested that they wanted to hold the front of the snake.",
        "purport": " The demons thought that the front of the snake was auspicious and that catching hold of that portion would be more chivalrous. Moreover, Daityas must always do the opposite of the demigods. That is their nature. We have actually seen this in relation to our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. We are advocating cow protection and encouraging people to drink more milk and eat palatable preparations made of milk, but the demons, just to protest such proposals, are claiming that they are advanced in scientific knowledge, as described here by the words sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya-\u015bruta-sampann\u0101\u1e25. They say that according to their scientific way, they have discovered that milk is dangerous and that the beef obtained by killing cows is very nutritious. This difference of opinion will always continue. Indeed, it has existed since days of yore. Millions of years ago, there was the same competition. The demons, as a result of their so-called Vedic study, preferred to hold the side of the snake near the mouth. The Supreme Personality of Godhead thought it wise to catch hold of the dangerous part of the snake and allow the demons to hold the tail, which was not dangerous, but because of a competitive desire, the demons thought it wise to hold the snake near the mouth. If the demigods were going to drink poison, the demons would resolve, \u201cWhy should we not share the poison and die gloriously by drinking it?\u201d In regard to the words sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya-\u015bruta-sampann\u0101\u1e25 prakhy\u0101t\u0101 janma-karmabhi\u1e25, another question may be raised. If one is actually educated in Vedic knowledge, is famous for performing prescribed activities and has been born in a great aristocratic family, why should he be called a demon? The answer is that one may be highly educated and may have been born in an aristocratic family, but if he is godless, if he does not listen to the instructions of God, then he is a demon. There are many examples in history of men like Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, R\u0101va\u1e47a and Ka\u1e41sa who were well educated, who were born in aristocratic families and who were very powerful and chivalrous in fighting, but who, because of deriding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were called R\u0101k\u1e63asas, or demons. One may be very well educated, but if he has no sense of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no obedience to the Supreme Lord, he is a demon. That is described by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.15): \u201cThose miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.\u201d \u0100sura\u1e41 bh\u0101vam refers to not accepting the existence of God or the transcendental instructions of the Personality of Godhead. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 clearly consists of transcendental instructions imparted directly by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But asuras, instead of accepting these instructions directly, make commentaries according to their own whimsical ways and mislead everyone, without profit even for themselves. One should therefore be very careful of demoniac, godless persons. According to the words of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even if a godless demon is very well educated, he must be considered a m\u016b\u1e0dha, nar\u0101dhama and m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101na."

As we have previously described, there are two classes of men \u2014 the demons and the demigods \u2014 but neither of them are supremely powerful. Everyone has experienced that hindrances are imposed upon us by the supreme power. The demons regard these hindrances as mere accidents or chance, but devotees accept them to be acts of the supreme ruler. When faced with hindrances, therefore, devotees pray to the Lord. Tat te\u00a0\u2019nukamp\u0101\u1e41 susam\u012bk\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47o bhu\u00f1j\u0101na ev\u0101tma-k\u1e5bta\u1e41 vip\u0101kam. Devotees endure hindrances, accepting them to be caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and regarding them as benedictions. Demons, however, being unable to understand the supreme controller, regard such hindrances as accidental. Here, of course, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present personally. It was by His will that there were hindrances, and by His will those hindrances were removed. The Lord appeared as a tortoise to support the great mountain. K\u1e63itir iha vipulatare tava ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati p\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dhe. The Lord held the great mountain on His back.

These five mantras are within the category of thirty-eight special Vedic mantras chanted by Lord \u015aiva, who is therefore celebrated as \u015aiva or Mah\u0101deva. Another reason why Lord \u015aiva is called \u015aiva, which means \u201call-auspicious,\u201d is that he is self-illuminated, exactly like Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is the Param\u0101tm\u0101. Because Lord \u015aiva is directly an incarnation of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he is situated as Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s direct representative.

        "purport": " The brahmajyoti is actually the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.40): \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes.\u201d Although the impersonal feature of the Absolute is an expansion of the rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He does not need to take care of the impersonalists who enter the brahmajyoti.

M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, who prefer to merge into this Brahman effulgence, worship Lord \u015aiva.

This does not mean, however, that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is not omniscient. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is omniscient, but He does not need to understand what is going on in His all-pervading expansion. Therefore in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that although everything is an expansion of Him (may\u0101 tatam ida\u1e41 sarvam), He does not need to take care of everything (na c\u0101ha\u1e41 te\u1e63v avasthita\u1e25), since there are various directors like Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and Indra."

        "purport": " Here is an explanation of how those engaged in activities for the welfare of others are very quickly recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.68-69), ya ida\u1e41 parama\u1e41 guhya\u1e41 mad-bhakte\u1e63v abhidh\u0101syati \u2026 na ca tasm\u0101n manu\u1e63ye\u1e63u ka\u015bcin me priya-k\u1e5bttama\u1e25: \u201cOne who preaches the message of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to My devotees is most dear to Me. No one can excel him in satisfying Me by worship.\u201d There are different kinds of welfare activities in this material world, but the supreme welfare activity is the spreading of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Other welfare activities cannot be effective, for the laws of nature and the results of karma cannot be checked. It is by destiny, or the laws of karma, that one must suffer or enjoy. For instance, if one is given a court order, he must accept it, whether it brings suffering or profit. Similarly, everyone is under obligations to karma and it reactions. No one can change this. Therefore the \u015b\u0101stra says: One should endeavor for that which is never obtained by wandering up and down the universe as a result of the reactions of karma. What is that? One should endeavor to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. If one tries to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world, he should be understood to be performing the best welfare activity. The Lord is automatically very pleased with him. If the Lord is pleased with him, what is left for him to achieve? If one has been recognized by the Lord, even if he does not ask the Lord for anything, the Lord, who is within everyone, supplies him whatever he wants. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 nity\u0101bhiyukt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 yoga-k\u1e63ema\u1e41 vah\u0101my aham). Again, as stated here, tapyante loka-t\u0101pena s\u0101dhava\u1e25 pr\u0101ya\u015bo jan\u0101\u1e25. The best welfare activity is raising people to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, since the conditioned souls are suffering only for want of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The Lord Himself also comes to mitigate the suffering of humanity. \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself. To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear millennium after millennium.\u201d (Bg. 4.7-8) All the \u015b\u0101stras conclude, therefore, that spreading the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is the best welfare activity in the world. Because of the ultimate benefit this bestows upon people in general, the Lord very quickly recognizes such service performed by a devotee."
