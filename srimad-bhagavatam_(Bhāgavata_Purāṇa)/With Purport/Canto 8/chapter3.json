        "purport": " Such remembrance is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.43-44): In these verses it is assured that even if a person engaged in devotional service falls down, he is not degraded, but is placed in a position in which he will in due course of time remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained later, Gajendra was formerly King Indradyumna, and somehow or other in his next life he became King of the elephants. Now Gajendra was in danger, and although he was in a body other than that of a human being, he remembered the stotra he had chanted in his previous life. Yatate ca tato bh\u016bya\u1e25 sa\u1e41siddhau kuru-nandana. To enable one to achieve perfection, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives one the chance to remember Him again. This is proved here, for although the King of the elephants, Gajendra, was put in danger, this was a chance for him to remember his previous devotional activities so that he could immediately be rescued by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is imperative, therefore, that all devotees in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness practice chanting some mantra. Certainly one should chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, which is the mah\u0101-mantra, or great mantra, and also one should practice chanting cint\u0101ma\u1e47i-prakara-sadmasu or the N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha strotra (ito n\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha\u1e25 parato n\u1e5bsi\u1e41ho yato yato y\u0101mi tato n\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha\u1e25). Every devotee should practice in order to chant some mantra perfectly so that even though he may be imperfect in spiritual consciousness in this life, in his next life he will not forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, even if he becomes an animal. Of course, a devotee should try to perfect his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in this life, for simply by understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His instructions, after giving up this body one can return home, back to Godhead. Even if there is some falldown, practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness never goes in vain. For example, Aj\u0101mila, in his boyhood, practiced chanting the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a under the direction of his father, but later, in his youth, he fell down and became a drunkard, woman-hunter, rogue and thief. Nonetheless, because of chanting the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a for the purpose of calling his son, whom he had named N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, he became advanced, even though he was involved in sinful activities. Therefore, we should not forget the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra under any circumstances. It will help us in the greatest danger, as we find in the life of Gajendra."

        "translation": "The King of the elephants, Gajendra, said: I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Person, V\u0101sudeva [o\u1e41 namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya]. Because of Him this material body acts due to the presence of spirit, and He is therefore the root cause of everyone. He is worshipable for such exalted persons as Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, and He has entered the heart of every living being. Let me meditate upon Him.",
        "purport": " In this verse the words etac cid-\u0101tmakam are very important. The material body certainly consists only of material elements, but when one awakens to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious understanding, the body is no longer material but spiritual. The material body is meant for sense enjoyment, whereas the spiritual body engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Therefore, a devotee who engages in the service of the Supreme Lord and who constantly thinks of Him should never be considered to have a material body. It is therefore enjoined, guru\u1e63u nara-mati\u1e25: one should stop thinking of the spiritual master as an ordinary human being with a material body. Arcye vi\u1e63\u1e47au \u015bil\u0101-dh\u012b\u1e25: everyone knows that the Deity in the temple is made of stone, but to think that the Deity is merely stone is an offense. Similarly, to think that the body of the spiritual master consists of material ingredients is offensive. Atheists think that devotees foolishly worship a stone statue as God and an ordinary man as the guru. The fact is, however, that by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s omnipotence, the so-called stone statue of the Deity is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the body of the spiritual master is directly spiritual. A pure devotee who is engaged in unalloyed devotional service should be understood to be situated on the transcendental platform (sa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate). Let us therefore offer our obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whose mercy so-called material things also become spiritual when they are engaged in spiritual activity. O\u1e41k\u0101ra (pra\u1e47ava) is the symbolic sound representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. O\u1e41 tat sad iti nirde\u015bo brahma\u1e47as tri-vidha\u1e25 sm\u1e5bta\u1e25: the three words o\u1e41 tat sat immediately invoke the Supreme Person. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He is o\u1e41k\u0101ra in all the Vedic mantras (pra\u1e47ava\u1e25 sarva-vede\u1e63u). The Vedic mantras are pronounced beginning with o\u1e41k\u0101ra to indicate immediately the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, for example, begins with the words o\u1e41 namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya. There is no difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva, and o\u1e41k\u0101ra (pra\u1e47ava). We should be careful to understand that o\u1e41k\u0101ra does not indicate anything nir\u0101k\u0101ra, or formless. Indeed, this verse immediately says, o\u1e41 namo bhagavate. Bhagav\u0101n is a person. Thus o\u1e41k\u0101ra is the representation of the Supreme Person. O\u1e41k\u0101ra is not meant to be impersonal, as the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers consider it to be. This is distinctly expressed here by the word puru\u1e63\u0101ya. The supreme truth addressed by o\u1e41k\u0101ra is puru\u1e63a, the Supreme Person; He is not impersonal. Unless He is a person, how can He control the great, stalwart controllers of this universe? Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva are the supreme controllers of this universe, but Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is offered obeisances even by Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. Therefore this verse uses the word pare\u015b\u0101ya, which indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by exalted demigods. Pare\u015b\u0101ya means parame\u015bvara. Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva are \u012b\u015bvaras, great controllers, but Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is parame\u015bvara, the supreme controller."

Therefore we must accept the statements given by the Supreme when He kindly incarnates to instruct us.

Then it may be possible for us to know the purpose of Their incarnations. If by the Lord\u2019s grace one can understand Him, one will immediately be delivered, even within his material body. The material body will no longer have any function, and whatever activities take place with the body will be activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In this way one may give up his body and return home, back to Godhead."

He has immense potency, and in various forms, all free from material contamination, He acts wonderfully. He is therefore the Supreme Brahman. I offer my respects to Him.",
        "purport": " In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said, gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e41\u015b ca do\u1e63\u0101\u1e41\u015b ca mune vyat\u012bta samasta-kaly\u0101\u1e47a-gu\u1e47\u0101tmako hi. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material form, qualities or faults. He is spiritual and is the only reservoir of all spiritual qualities. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.8) by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m. The Lord\u2019s activities of saving the devotees and annihilating the demons are transcendental. Anyone annihilated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead gets the same result as a devotee who is protected by the Lord; both of them are transcendentally promoted. The only difference is that a devotee goes directly to the spiritual planets and becomes an associate of the Supreme Lord, whereas demons are promoted to brahmaloka, the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. Both of them, however, are transcendentally promoted. The Lord\u2019s killing or annihilating of the demons is not exactly like the killing of this material world. Although He appears to act within the modes of material nature, He is nirgu\u1e47a, above the modes of nature. His name is not material; otherwise how could one get liberation by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare R\u0101ma? The names of the Lord like R\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are nondifferent from the person R\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra one constantly associates with R\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore becomes liberated. A practical example is Aj\u0101mila, who always remained transcendental to his activities simply by chanting the name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. If this was true of Aj\u0101mila, what is to be said of the Supreme Lord? When the Lord comes to this material world, He does not become a product of matter. This is confirmed throughout Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (janma-karma ca me divyam, avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam). Therefore, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 R\u0101ma or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 descends to act transcendentally for our benefit, we should not consider Him an ordinary human being. When the Lord comes, He does so on the basis of His spiritual potency (sambhav\u0101my \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101). Because He is not forced to come by the material energy, He is always transcendental. One should not consider the Supreme Lord an ordinary human being. Material names and forms are contaminated, but spiritual name and spiritual form are transcendental."

If one wants to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead in truth, one must take to the activities of devotional service. These activities are called sattva or \u015buddha-sattva. In the material world, activities of goodness, which are symptomatic of a pure br\u0101hma\u1e47a, are appreciated. But the activities of devotional service are \u015buddha-sattva; in other words, they are on the transcendental platform. Only by devotional service can one understand the Supreme. Devotional service is called nai\u1e63karmya. Mere negation of material activity will not endure. Nai\u1e63karmyam apy acyuta-bh\u0101va-varjitam. Unless one performs activities with reference to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, cessation of material activities will not be helpful. In hopes of achieving nai\u1e63karmya, freedom from material action, many highly elevated sanny\u0101s\u012bs stopped their activities, yet they failed and returned to the material platform to act as materialistic persons. But once one is engaged in the spiritual activities of bhakti-yoga, one does not fall down. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore an attempt to engage everyone always in spiritual activity, by which one becomes transcendental to material actions.

I also offer my respectful obeisances unto the impersonal Brahman effulgence.",
        "purport": " In the previous verses it has been described that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material form, He accepts innumerable forms to favor His devotees and kill the demons. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, there are so many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that they are like the waves of a river. The waves of a river flow incessantly, and no one can count how many waves there are. Similarly, no one can calculate when and how the different incarnations of the Lord appear according to the necessities of time, place and candidates. The Lord appears perpetually. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.7): \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself.\u201d In the material world there is always the possibility of deviation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotees always act in various forms to curb such godlessness. Even impersonalists who stress the knowledge feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead want to merge in the effulgence of the Lord. Therefore, here the word j\u00f1\u0101na-ghan\u0101ya indicates that for atheists who disbelieve in the form and existence of the Lord, all these various incarnations appear. Since the Lord comes to teach in so many forms, no one can say that there is no God. The word j\u00f1\u0101na-ghan\u0101ya is especially used here to refer to those whose knowledge has become solidified by dint of their searching for the Lord through speculative philosophical understanding. Superficial knowledge is useless for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when one\u2019s knowledge becomes extremely intense and deep, one understands V\u0101sudeva (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25). A j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b attains this stage after many, many births. Therefore the word j\u00f1\u0101na-ghan\u0101ya is used here. The word \u015b\u0101nt\u0101ya indicates that Lord V\u0101sudeva is situated in everyone\u2019s heart but does not act with the living entity. Impersonalist j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs realize V\u0101sudeva when they are fully mature in knowledge (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25)."

I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.3) the Lord says, k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a\u1e41 c\u0101pi m\u0101\u1e41 viddhi sarva-k\u1e63etre\u1e63u bh\u0101rata: \u201cO scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies.\u201d Every one of us is thinking, \u201cI am this body\u201d or \u201cThis is my body,\u201d but actually the truth is different. Our bodies are given to us by the supreme proprietor. The living entity, who is also k\u1e63etra j\u00f1a, or the knower of the body, is not the body\u2019s only proprietor; the actual proprietor of the body is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme k\u1e63etra j\u00f1a. For example, we may rent and occupy a house, but actually the owner of the house is the landlord. Similarly, we may be allotted a certain type of body as a facility with which to enjoy this material world, but the actual proprietor of the body is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is called sarv\u0101dhyak\u1e63a because everything in the material world works under His supervision. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10), wherein the Lord says, may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sacar\u0101caram: \u201cThis material nature, working under My direction, O son of Kunt\u012b, is producing all moving and unmoving beings.\u201d From prak\u1e5bti, or material nature, come so many varieties of living entities, including aquatics, plants, trees, insects, birds, animals, human beings and demigods. Prak\u1e5bti is the mother, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the father (aha\u1e41 b\u012bja-prada\u1e25 pit\u0101). Prak\u1e5bti can give us material bodies, but as spirit souls we are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7): mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25. The living entity, being part and parcel of God, is not a product of this material world. Therefore the Lord is described in this verse as \u0101tma-m\u016bla, the original source of everything. He is the seed of all existences (b\u012bja\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m). In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.4) the Lord says: \u201cIt should be understood that all living entities, in all species of life, O son of Kunt\u012b, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.\u201d Plants, trees, insects, aquatics, demigods, beasts, birds and all other living entities are sons or parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, but because they are struggling with different mentalities, they have been given different types of bodies (mana\u1e25 \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u012bndriy\u0101\u1e47i prak\u1e5bti-sth\u0101ni kar\u1e63ati). Thus they have become sons of prak\u1e5bti, or material nature, which is impregnated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Every living entity in this material world is struggling for existence, and the only salvation or relief from the cycle of birth and death in the evolutionary process is full surrender. This is indicated by the word nama\u1e25, \u201cI offer my respectful obeisances unto You.\u201d"

        "purport": " To paraphrase this verse: \u201cThe objectives of sensual activities are actually observed by You. Without Your direction, the living entity cannot take even a step forward. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6do matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca. You are situated in everyone\u2019s heart, and only from You come remembrance and forgetfulness. Ch\u0101yeva yasya bhuvan\u0101ni bibharti durg\u0101. The living entity under the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 wants to enjoy this material world, but unless You give him directions and remind him, he cannot make progress in pursuing his shadowy objective in life. The conditioned soul wrongly progresses toward the wrong objective, life after life, and he is reminded of that objective by You. In one life the conditioned soul desires to progress toward a certain objective, but after his body changes, he forgets everything. Nonetheless, my Lord, because he wanted to enjoy something of this world, You remind him of this in his next birth. Matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca. Because the conditioned soul wants to forget You, by Your grace You give him opportunities, life after life, by which he can almost perpetually forget You. Therefore You are eternally the director of the conditioned souls. It is because You are the original cause of everything that everything appears real. The ultimate reality is Your Lordship, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.\u201d The word sarva-pratyaya-hetave is explained by \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, who says that a result gives one a glimpse of its cause. For example, since an earthen pot is the result of the actions of a potter, by seeing the earthen pot one can guess at the existence of the potter. Similarly, this material world resembles the spiritual world, and any intelligent person can guess how it is acting. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram. The activities of the material world suggest that behind them is the superintendence of the Lord."

Because it is You who can give liberation, You are the only shelter for all transcendentalists. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described herein as the wonderful cause. He is wonderful in the sense that although there may be unlimited emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead (janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25), He always remains complete (p\u016br\u1e47asya p\u016br\u1e47am \u0101d\u0101ya p\u016br\u1e47am ev\u0101va\u015bi\u1e63yate). In our experience in the material world, if we have a bank balance of one million dollars, as we withdraw money from the bank the balance gradually diminishes until it becomes nil. However, the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is so complete that although innumerable Personalities of Godhead expand from Him, He remains the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. P\u016br\u1e47asya p\u016br\u1e47am \u0101d\u0101ya p\u016br\u1e47am ev\u0101va\u015bi\u1e63yate. Therefore He is the wonderful cause. Govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi. \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.1) Even in this material world, we can understand that the sun has existed for millions of years and has given off heat and light since its creation, yet the sun still retains its power and never changes. What then is to be said of the supreme cause, para\u1e41 brahma, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a? Everything emanates from Him perpetually, yet He maintains His original form (sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8), matta\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 pravartate: \u201cEverything emanates from Me.\u201d Everything emanates from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a eternally, yet He is the same K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and does not change. Therefore He is the shelter of all transcendentalists who are eager to get free from material bondage. Everyone must take shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is therefore advised: \u201cWhether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.3.10) Para\u1e41 brahma, the Supreme Lord, and para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma, the supreme repose, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore anyone who desires anything \u2014 whether he be a karm\u012b, a j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b or a yog\u012b \u2014 should try to perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead very seriously, and all of his desires will be fulfilled. The Lord says, ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham: \u201cAs the living entities surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly.\u201d Even the karm\u012b who wants everything for his enjoyment can get it from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. For K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, supplying what he wants is not at all difficult. Actually, however, one should worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for the sake of getting liberation. Vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. By studying the Vedic literature, one should understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As confirmed here, sarv\u0101gam\u0101mn\u0101ya-mah\u0101r\u1e47av\u0101ya. He is the ocean, and all Vedic knowledge flows toward Him. Therefore, intelligent transcendentalists take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). This is the ultimate goal."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.11) it is said: For a devotee who has taken the lotus feet of the Lord within his heart, the Lord gives spiritual enlightenment, known as j\u00f1\u0101na-d\u012bpa, by special mercy from within. This j\u00f1\u0101na-d\u012bpa is compared to the fire hidden within ara\u1e47i wood. To perform fire sacrifices, great sages previously did not ignite a fire directly; the fire would be invoked from ara\u1e47i wood. Similarly, all living entities are covered by the modes of material nature, and the fire of knowledge can be ignited only by the Supreme Personality of Godhead when one takes Him within one\u2019s heart. Sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25. If one takes seriously the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is seated within one\u2019s heart, the Lord eradicates all ignorance. By the torch of knowledge, one immediately understands everything properly by the special mercy of the Supreme Lord and becomes self-realized. In other words, although a devotee may externally not be very well educated, because of his devotional service the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives him enlightenment from within. If the Lord gives enlightenment from within, how can one be in ignorance? Therefore the allegation of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs that the devotional path is for the unintelligent or uneducated is untrue. If one becomes an unalloyed devotee of the Supreme Lord, he automatically manifests all good qualities. Such a devotee is above the instructions of the Vedas. He is a paramaha\u1e41sa. Even without going through the Vedic literature, a devotee becomes pure and enlightened by the mercy of the Lord. \u201cTherefore, my Lord,\u201d the devotee says, \u201cI offer my respectful obeisances unto You.\u201d"

There are many tattvas, such as vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, j\u012bva-tattva and \u015bakti-tattva, but above everything is the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, which is all-pervading. This all-pervading feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.42), wherein the Lord says: \u201cBut what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.\u201d Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that the entire material world is maintained by His partial representation as Param\u0101tm\u0101. The Lord enters every universe as Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and then expands Himself as K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to enter the hearts of all living entities and even enter the atoms. A\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham. Every universe is full of atoms, and the Lord is not only within the universe but also within the atoms. Thus within every atom the Supreme Lord exists in His Vi\u1e63\u1e47u feature as Param\u0101tm\u0101, but all the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattvas emanate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.2), aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the \u0101di, or beginning, of the devas of this material world \u2014 Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Mahe\u015bvara. Therefore He is described here as bhagavate b\u1e5bhate. Everyone is bhagav\u0101n \u2014 everyone possesses opulence \u2014 but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is b\u1e5bh\u0101n bhagav\u0101n, the possessor of unlimited opulence. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of everyone. Aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25. Even Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Mahe\u015bvara come from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat ki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1jaya: there is no personality superior to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that bhagavate b\u1e5bhate means \u201cunto \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d In this material world, everyone is a pa\u015bu, an animal, because of the bodily conception of life. \u201cA human being who identifies the body made of three elements as the self, who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the land of his birth to be worshipable, and who goes to a place of pilgrimage simply to bathe rather than to meet men of transcendental knowledge there is to be considered like a cow or an ass.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 10.84.13) Practically everyone, therefore, is a pa\u015bu, an animal, and everyone is attacked by the crocodile of material existence. Not only the King of the elephants but every one of us is being attacked by the crocodile and is suffering the consequences. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can deliver us from this material existence. Indeed, He is always trying to deliver us. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be\u00a0\u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati. He is within our hearts and is not at all inattentive. His only aim is to deliver us from material life. It is not that He becomes attentive to us only when we offer prayers to Him. Even before we offer our prayers, He incessantly tries to deliver us. He is never lazy in regard to our deliverance. Therefore this verse says, bh\u016bri-karu\u1e47\u0101ya namo\u00a0\u2019lay\u0101ya. It is the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord that He always tries to bring us back home, back to Godhead. God is liberated, and He tries to make us liberated, but although He is constantly trying, we refuse to accept His instructions (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). Nonetheless, He has not become angry. Therefore He is described here as bh\u016bri-karu\u1e47\u0101ya, unlimitedly merciful in delivering us from this miserable material condition of life and taking us back home, back to Godhead."

        "translation": "Unalloyed devotees, who have no desire other than to serve the Lord, worship Him in full surrender and always hear and chant about His activities, which are most wonderful and auspicious. Thus they always merge in an ocean of transcendental bliss. Such devotees never ask the Lord for any benediction. I, however, am in danger. Thus I pray to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternally existing, who is invisible, who is the Lord of all great personalities, such as Brahm\u0101, and who is available only by transcendental bhakti-yoga. Being extremely subtle, He is beyond the reach of my senses and transcendental to all external realization. He is unlimited, He is the original cause, and He is completely full in everything. I offer my obeisances unto Him.",
        "purport": " \u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\u201d Unalloyed devotees have nothing to ask from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Gajendra, the King of the elephants, was circumstantially asking for an immediate benediction because he had no other way to be rescued. Sometimes, when there is no alternative, a pure devotee, being fully dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, prays for some benediction. But in such a prayer there is also regret. One who always hears and chants about the transcendental pastimes of the Lord is always situated on a platform on which he has nothing to ask in terms of material benefits. Unless one is a completely pure devotee, one cannot enjoy the transcendental bliss derived from chanting and dancing in the ecstasy of the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement. Such ecstasy is not possible for an ordinary devotee. Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu showed us how one can enjoy transcendental bliss simply by chanting, hearing and dancing in ecstasy. This is bhakti-yoga. Therefore the King of the elephants, Gajendra, said, \u0101dhy\u0101tmika-yoga-gamyam, indicating that unless one is situated on this transcendental platform, one cannot approach the Supreme Lord. The benediction of being able to approach the Lord can be achieved after many, many births, yet \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has awarded this benediction to everyone, even to the fallen souls who have no heritage of anything in spiritual life. That is actually being seen in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Therefore the path of bhakti-yoga is the spotless process by which to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhakty\u0101ham ekay\u0101 gr\u0101hya\u1e25: only through devotional service can one approach the Supreme Lord. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.1): \u201cNow hear, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101 [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.\u201d Simply by being attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and by thinking of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constantly, one can fully understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without a doubt."

        "purport": " The King of the elephants, Gajendra, simply accepted that there must be someone who has created this cosmic manifestation and has supplied its ingredients. This should be admitted by everyone, even the most determined atheists. Why, then, do the nondevotees and atheists not admit this? The reason is that they are polluted by the reactions of their fruitive activities. One must be freed from all the dirt accumulated within the heart due to fruitive activities performed one after another. One must wash off this dirt by practicing bhakti-yoga. Yoga-randhita-karm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25. As long as one is covered by material nature\u2019s modes of ignorance and passion, there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Lord. Tad\u0101 rajas-tamo-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25 k\u0101ma-lobh\u0101daya\u015b ca ye. When one is freed from the modes of ignorance and passion, one becomes free from the lowest qualities \u2014 k\u0101ma and lobha, lust and greed. Nowadays there are so many yoga schools to encourage people in developing their lusty desires and greed through the practice of yoga. People are therefore very much fond of so-called yoga practice. The actual practice of yoga, however, is described here. As authoritatively stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.13.1), dhy\u0101n\u0101vasthita-tad-gatena manas\u0101 pa\u015byanti ya\u1e41 yogina\u1e25: a yog\u012b is one who always meditates on the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38): \u201cI worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is \u015ay\u0101masundara, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, with inconceivable innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotees see in their heart of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love.\u201d The bhakti-yog\u012b constantly sees \u015ay\u0101masundara \u2014 beautiful Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with His blackish bodily hue. Because the King of the elephants, Gajendra, thought himself an ordinary animal, he thought himself unfit to see the Lord. In his humility, he thought that he could not practice yoga. In other words, how can those who are like animals in the bodily concept of life, and who have no purity of consciousness, practice yoga? In the present day, people who have no control over their senses, who have no understanding of philosophy and who do not follow religious principles or rules and regulations are nonetheless pretending to be yog\u012bs. This is the greatest anomaly in the practice of mystic yoga."

M\u0101y\u0101 covers the living entity because of his willingness to forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead and make his own plan to enjoy this material world.

Covered by all this, he will continue to think, \u201cI am this body, and everything related to this body is mine.\u201d This materialistic conception of life is extremely difficult to surmount, but one who surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as did Gajendra, the King of the elephants, comes to enlightenment on the Brahman platform. \u201cOne who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\u201d (Bg. 18.54) Since a devotee is completely on the Brahman platform, he is not jealous of any other living entity (sama\u1e25 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u)."

Thus none of them approached him. However, because Lord Hari is the Supersoul, Puru\u1e63ottama, the Personality of Godhead, He appeared before Gajendra.",
        "purport": " From the description of Gajendra, he apparently was aiming at the supreme authority although he did not know who the supreme authority is. He conjectured, \u201cThere is a supreme authority who is above everything.\u201d Under the circumstances, the Lord\u2019s various expansions, such as Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, Candra and Indra, all thought, \u201cGajendra is not asking our help. He is asking the help of the Supreme, who is above all of us.\u201d As Gajendra has described, the Supreme Lord has various parts and parcels, including the demigods, human beings and animals, all covered by separate forms. Although the demigods are in charge of maintaining different aspects of the universe, Gajendra thought that they were unable to rescue him. Hari\u1e41 vin\u0101 naiva m\u1e5bti\u1e41 taranti: no one can rescue anyone from the dangers of birth, death, old age and disease. It is only the Supreme Personality of Godhead who can rescue one from the dangers of material existence. Therefore an intelligent person, to get free from this dangerous existence, approaches the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not any demigod. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20), k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante\u00a0\u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25: those who are unintelligent approach the various demigods for temporary material benefits. Actually, however, these demigods cannot rescue the living entity from the dangers of material existence. Like other living entities, the demigods are merely external parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s transcendental body. As stated in the Vedic mantras, sa \u0101tma-a\u1e45g\u0101ny any\u0101 devat\u0101\u1e25. Within the body is the \u0101tm\u0101, the soul, whereas the various parts of the body like the hands and legs are external. Similarly, the \u0101tm\u0101 of the entire cosmic manifestation is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and all the demigods, human beings and other living entities are parts of His body. It may also be concluded that since a tree lives on the strength of its root and when the root is nourished with water all the parts of the tree are nourished, one should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the original root of everything. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very difficult to approach, He is very near to us because He lives within our hearts. As soon as the Lord understands that one is seeking His favor by fully surrendering, naturally He immediately takes action. Therefore although the demigods did not come to the aid of Gajendra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead immediately appeared before him because of his fervent prayer. This does not mean that the demigods were angry with Gajendra, for actually when Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped, all the other demigods are also worshiped. Yasmin tu\u1e63\u1e6de jagat tu\u1e63\u1e6dam: if the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied, everyone is satisfied. \u201cAs pouring water on the root of a tree energizes the trunk, branches, twigs and everything else, and as supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, so simply worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead through devotional service automatically satisfies the demigods, who are parts of that Supreme Personality.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 4.31.14) When the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped, all the demigods are satisfied."

He does not accuse the Supreme Personality of Godhead for having let His devotee fall into such a dangerous condition. Rather, he considers that dangerous condition to be due to his past misdeeds and takes it as an opportunity to pray to the Lord and offer thanks for having been given such an opportunity. When a devotee lives in this way, his salvation \u2014 his going back home, back to Godhead \u2014 is guaranteed. We can see this to be true from the example of Gajendra, who anxiously prayed to the Lord and thus received an immediate chance to return home, back to Godhead."
