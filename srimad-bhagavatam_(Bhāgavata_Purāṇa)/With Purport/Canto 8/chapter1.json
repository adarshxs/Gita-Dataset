Therefore, as especially mentioned here, g\u1e5b\u1e47anti kavaya\u1e25: the descriptions of various incarnations are accepted by great learned scholars with perfect intelligence. At the present time, especially in India, so many rascals are claiming to be incarnations, and people are being misled. Therefore, the identity of an incarnation should be confirmed by the descriptions of the \u015b\u0101stras and by wonderful activities. As described in this verse by the word mah\u012byasa\u1e25, the activities of an incarnation are not ordinary magic or jugglery, but are wonderful activities. Thus any incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be supported by the statements of the \u015b\u0101stra and must actually perform wonderful activities. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was eager to hear about the Manus of different ages. There are fourteen Manus during a day of Brahm\u0101, and the age of each Manu lasts for seventy-one yugas. Thus there are thousands of Manus during the life of Brahm\u0101."

The king of the country or the emperor of the empire must be so trained that by nature he renounces sense gratification. It is not that because one becomes king he should unnecessarily spend money for sense gratification. As soon as kings became degraded, spending money for sense gratification, they were lost. Similarly, at the present moment, monarchy having been lost, the people have created democracy, which is also failing. Now, by the laws of nature, the time is coming when dictatorship will put the citizens into more and more difficulty. If the king or dictator individually, or the members of the government collectively, cannot maintain the state or kingdom according to the rules of Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, certainly their government will not endure."

Therefore, one should accept only that which is allotted to him; one should not desire to infringe upon the property of others.",
        "purport": " Having described the situation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as transcendental, Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, for the instruction of the sons and grandsons in his dynasty, is now describing all the property of the universe as belonging to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Manu\u2019s instructions are not only for his own sons and grandsons, but for all of human society. The word \u201cman\u201d \u2014 or, in Sanskrit, manu\u1e63ya \u2014 has been derived from the name Manu, for all the members of human society are descendants of the original Manu. Manu is also mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.1), where the Lord says: \u201cI instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasv\u0101n, and Vivasv\u0101n instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku.\u201d Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu and Vaivasvata Manu have similar duties. Vaivasvata Manu was born of the sun-god, Vivasv\u0101n, and his son was Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, the King of the earth. Since Manu is understood to be the original father of humanity, human society should follow his instructions. Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu instructs that whatever exists, not only in the spiritual world but even within this material world, is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present everywhere as the Superconsciousness. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.3), k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1am c\u0101pi m\u0101\u1e41 viddhi sarva-k\u1e63etre\u1e63u bh\u0101rata: in every field \u2014 in other words, in every body \u2014 the Supreme Lord is existing as the Supersoul. The individual soul is given a body in which to live and act according to the instructions of the Supreme Person, and therefore the Supreme Person also exists within every body. We should not think that we are independent; rather, we should understand that we are allotted a certain portion of the total property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This understanding will lead to perfect communism. Communists think in terms of their own nations, but the spiritual communism instructed here is not only nationwide but universal. Nothing belongs to any nation or any individual person; everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the meaning of this verse. \u0100tm\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 vi\u015bvam: whatever exists within this universe is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The modern communistic theory, and also the idea of the United Nations, can be reformed \u2014 indeed, rectified \u2014 by the understanding that everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is not a creation of our intelligence; rather, He has created us. \u0100tm\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 vi\u015bvam. \u012a\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam. This universal communism can solve all the problems of the world. One should learn from the Vedic literature that one\u2019s body is also not the property of the individual soul, but is given to the individual soul according to his karma. Karma\u1e47\u0101 daiva-netre\u1e47a jantur dehopapattaye. The 8,400,000 different bodily forms are machines given to the individual soul. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61): \u201cThe Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.\u201d The Lord, as the Supersoul, sits in everyone\u2019s heart and observes the various desires of the individual soul. The Lord is so merciful that He gives the living entity the opportunity to enjoy varieties of desires in suitable bodies, which are nothing but machines (yantr\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101ni m\u0101yay\u0101). These machines are manufactured by the material ingredients of the external energy, and thus the living entity enjoys or suffers according to his desires. This opportunity is given by the Supersoul. Everything belongs to the Supreme, and therefore one should not usurp another\u2019s property. We have a tendency to manufacture many things. Especially nowadays, we are building skyscrapers and developing other material facilities. We should know, however, that the ingredients of the skyscrapers and machines cannot be manufactured by anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The whole world is nothing but a combination of the five material elements (tejo-v\u0101ri-m\u1e5bd\u0101\u1e41 yath\u0101 vinimaya\u1e25). A skyscraper is a transformation of earth, water and fire. Earth and water are combined and burnt into bricks by fire, and a skyscraper is essentially a tall construction of bricks. Although the bricks may be manufactured by man, the ingredients of the bricks are not. Of course, man, as a manufacturer, may accept a salary from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is stated here: tena tyaktena bhu\u00f1j\u012bth\u0101\u1e25. One may construct a big skyscraper, but neither the constructor, the merchant nor the worker can claim proprietorship. Proprietorship belongs to the person who has spent for the building. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has manufactured water, earth, air, fire and the sky, and one can use these and take a salary (tena tyaktena bhu\u00f1j\u012bth\u0101\u1e25). However, one cannot claim proprietorship. This is perfect communism. Our tendency to construct great buildings should be used only for constructing large and valuable temples in which to install the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then our desire for construction will be fulfilled. Since all property belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything should be offered to the Lord, and we should take only pras\u0101da (tena tyaktena bhu\u00f1j\u012bth\u0101\u1e25). We should not fight among ourselves to take more than we need. As N\u0101rada said to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira: \u201cOne may claim proprietorship to as much wealth as required to maintain body and soul together, but one who desires proprietorship over more than that must be considered a thief, and he deserves to be punished by the laws of nature.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 7.14.8) Of course, we need to be maintained in eating, sleeping, mating and defending (\u0101h\u0101ra-nidra-bhaya-maithuna), but since the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, has provided these necessities of life for the birds and bees, why not for mankind? There is no need for economic development; everything is provided. Therefore one should understand that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and with this idea, one may take pras\u0101da. However, if one interferes with the allotments of others, he is a thief. We should not accept more than what we actually need. Therefore, if by chance we get an abundance of money, we should always consider that it belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness we are getting sufficient money, but we should never think that the money belongs to us; it belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should be equally distributed to the workers, the devotees. No devotee should claim that any money or property belongs to him. If one thinks that any portion of property of this huge universe belongs to anyone, he is to be considered a thief and is punishable by the laws of nature. Daiv\u012b hy e\u1e63\u0101 gu\u1e47a-may\u012b mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101: no one can surpass the vigilance of material nature or hide his intentions from material nature. If human society unlawfully claims that the property of the universe, either partially or wholly, belongs to mankind, all of human society will be cursed as a society of thieves and will be punished by the laws of nature."

With a little deliberation, even the most degraded person can perceive the presence of God. If we take into account whose property is the vast ocean, whose property is the vast land, how the sky exists, how the numberless millions of stars and planets are set in the sky, who has made this universe and whose property it is, we should certainly come to the conclusion that there is a proprietor of everything. When we claim proprietorship over a certain piece of land, whether individually or for our families or nations, we should also consider how we became the proprietors. The land was there before our birth, before we came to the land. How did it become our property? Such deliberation will help us understand that there is a supreme proprietor of everything \u2014 the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Godhead is always awake. In the conditioned stage we forget things because we change our bodies, but because the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not change His body, He remembers past, present and future. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.1), ima\u1e41 vivasvate yoga\u1e41 proktav\u0101n aham avyayam: \u201cI spoke this science of God \u2014 Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 \u2014 to the sun-god at least forty million years ago.\u201d When Arjuna inquired from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a how He could remember incidents that had taken place so long ago, the Lord answered that Arjuna was also present at that time. Because Arjuna is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friend, wherever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a goes, Arjuna goes. But the difference is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembers everything, whereas the living entity like Arjuna, being a minute particle of the Supreme Lord, forgets. Therefore it is said, the Lord\u2019s vigilance is never diminished. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15). Sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6do matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca: the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature is always present within the hearts of all living entities, and from Him come memory, knowledge and forgetfulness. This is also indicated in this verse by the word supar\u1e47am, which means \u201cfriend.\u201d In the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (4.6) it is therefore said, dv\u0101 supar\u1e47a-sayuj\u0101 sakh\u0101y\u0101 sam\u0101na\u1e41 v\u1e5bk\u1e63a\u1e41 pari\u1e63asvaj\u0101te: two birds are sitting on the same tree as friends. One bird is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other is simply observing. This observing bird is always present as a friend to the eating bird and giving him remembrance of things he wanted to do. Thus if we take into account the Supreme Personality of Godhead in our daily affairs, we can see Him or at least perceive His presence everywhere. The words cak\u1e63ur yasya na ri\u1e63yati mean that although we cannot see Him, this does not mean that He cannot see us. Nor does He die when the cosmic manifestation is annihilated. The example is given in this connection that the sunshine is present when the sun is present, but when the sun is not present, or when we cannot see the sun, this does not mean that the sun is lost. The sun is there, but we cannot see it. Similarly, although we cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in our present darkness, our lack of knowledge, He is always present, seeing our activities. As the Param\u0101tm\u0101, He is the witness and adviser (upadra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 and anumant\u0101). Therefore, by following the instructions of the spiritual master and studying authorized literatures, one can understand that God is present before us, seeing everything, although we have no eyes with which to see Him."

This is spiritual existence. By chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, consisting of names of the Supreme Lord, we find that the name has all the potencies of the person. The Lord\u2019s activities are many, and according to His activities He has many names. He appeared as the son of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and also as the son of mother Devak\u012b, and therefore He is named Devak\u012b-nandana and Ya\u015bod\u0101-nandana. Par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate: the Lord has a multitude of energies, and therefore He acts in multifarious ways. Yet He has a particular name. The \u015b\u0101stras recommend which names we should chant, such as Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare. It is not that we have to search for some name or manufacture one. Rather, we must follow the saintly persons and the \u015b\u0101stras in chanting His holy name. Although the material and spiritual energies both belong to the Lord, He is impossible to understand as long as we are in the material energy. And when we come to the spiritual energy, He is very easy to know. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.7.23): m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 vyudasya cic-chakty\u0101 kaivalye sthita \u0101tmani. Although the external energy belongs to the Lord, when one is in the external energy (mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101) He is very difficult to understand. However, when one comes to the spiritual energy, one can understand Him. Therefore in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55) it is said, bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25: one who wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in reality must take to the platform of bhakti, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

Even though the people of the world have forgotten God and may say that God is dead, this is not a fact. One can understand God when one takes to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, and thus one can be happy."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises, yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25: \u201cWork done as a sacrifice for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has to be performed; otherwise work binds one to this material world.\u201d Generally, everyone is attracted to hard labor for becoming happy in this material world, but although various activities are going on all over the world simply for the sake of happiness, unfortunately only problems are being created from such fruitive activities. Therefore it is advised that active persons engage in activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which are called yaj\u00f1a, because then they will gradually come to the platform of devotional service. Yaj\u00f1a means Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, the enjoyer of all sacrifices (bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram). The Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the enjoyer, and therefore if we begin our activities for His satisfaction, we will gradually lose our taste for material activities. S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b declared to the great assembly of sages at Naimi\u1e63\u0101ra\u1e47ya: \u201cO best among the twice-born, it is concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties [dharma] according to caste divisions and order of life, is to please the Lord Hari.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.13) According to Vedic principles, everyone must act according to his classification as br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, \u015b\u016bdra, brahmac\u0101r\u012b, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha or sanny\u0101s\u012b. Everyone should progress toward perfection by acting in such a way that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be pleased (sa\u1e41siddhir hari-to\u1e63a\u1e47am). One cannot please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by sitting idly; one must act according to the directions of the spiritual master for the sake of pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then one will gradually come to the stage of pure devotional service. As confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.12): \u201cKnowledge of self-realization, even though freed from all material affinity, does not look well if devoid of a conception of the infallible [God].\u201d J\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs recommend that one adopt nai\u1e63karmya by not doing anything but simply meditating and thinking of Brahman, but this is impossible unless one realizes Parabrahman, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If there is no K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, any kind of activity, be it philanthropic, political or social, simply causes karma-bandhana, bondage to material work. As long as one is entangled in karma-bandhana, one must accept different types of bodies that spoil the human form of facility. Therefore, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.3) karma-yoga is recommended: \u201cFor one who is a neophyte in the yoga system, work is said to be the means; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all material activities is said to be the means.\u201d Nonetheless: \u201cOne who restrains the senses and organs of action, but whose mind dwells on sense objects, certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender.\u201d (Bg. 3.6) One should act for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very seriously in order to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and should not sit down to imitate such great personalities as Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura condemned such imitation. He said: \u201cMy dear mind, what kind of devotee are you? Simply for cheap adoration, you sit in a solitary place and pretend to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, but this is all cheating.\u201d Recently at M\u0101y\u0101pur an African devotee wanted to imitate Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, but after fifteen days he became restless and went away. Do not suddenly try to imitate Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura. Engage yourself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities, and gradually you will come to the stage of liberation (muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101 r\u016bpa\u1e41 svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25)."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full in opulence by His own gain, yet He acts as the creator, maintainer and annihilator of this material world.

        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9), yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25: \u201cWork done as a sacrifice for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has to be performed; otherwise work binds one to this material world.\u201d If we do not act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness we shall be entangled, like silkworms in cocoons. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appears in order to teach us how to work so that we will not be entangled in this material world. Our real problem is that we are entangled in materialistic activities, and because we are conditioned, our struggle continues through punishment in material existence in one body after another in different forms of life. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7): \u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\u201d The living entities are actually minute forms who are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is full in everything, and the small particles of the Lord are also originally qualified like Him, but because of their minute existence, they are infected by material attraction and thus entangled. We must therefore follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then, like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is never entangled by His material activities of creation, maintenance and annihilation, we will have nothing for which to lament (n\u0101vas\u012bdanti ye\u00a0\u2019nu tam). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally gives instructions in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and anyone who follows these instructions is liberated. Following K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions is possible when one is a devotee, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructs that one should become a devotee. Man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru: \u201cAlways think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me.\u201d (Bg. 18.65) Always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, but unless one is an initiated devotee he cannot do this. As soon as one becomes a devotee, he engages in Deity worship (mad-y\u0101j\u012b). A devotee\u2019s business is to offer obeisances to the Lord and the spiritual master constantly. This principle is the recognized way to come to the platform of bhakti. As soon as one comes to this platform, he gradually understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and simply by understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one is liberated from material bondage."

He is full in knowledge, free from material desires and diversions, and completely independent. As the supreme teacher of human society, He teaches His own way of activities, and thus He inaugurates the real path of religion. I request everyone to follow Him.",
        "purport": " This is the sum and substance of our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. We are simply requesting human society to follow in the footsteps of the teacher of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Follow the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is, and your life will be successful. That is the summary of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. The organizer of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is teaching everyone how to follow Lord R\u0101macandra, how to follow Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and how to follow \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. In this material world, we need a leader for a monarchy or good government. Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101macandra, by His practical example, showed how to live for the benefit of all human society. He fought with demons like R\u0101va\u1e47a, He carried out the orders of His father, and He remained the faithful husband of mother S\u012bt\u0101. Thus there is no comparison to Lord R\u0101macandra\u2019s acting as an ideal king. Indeed, people still hanker for r\u0101ma-r\u0101jya, a government conducted like that of Lord R\u0101macandra. Similarly, although Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He taught His disciple and devotee Arjuna how to lead a life ending in going back home, back to Godhead (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so\u00a0\u2019rjuna). All teachings \u2014 political, economic, social, religious, cultural and philosophical \u2014 are to be found in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One only has to follow them strictly. The Supreme Personality of Godhead also comes as Lord Caitanya just to play the part of a pure devotee. Thus the Lord teaches us in different ways just to make our lives successful, and Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu requests us to follow Him. Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu is the leader of mankind, and he has given a book called Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 to guide human society. Herein he directs us to follow the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different incarnations. These incarnations are described in Vedic literature, and Jayadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has described ten important incarnations in summary (ke\u015bava dh\u1e5bta-m\u012bna-\u015bar\u012bra jaya jagad-\u012b\u015ba hare, ke\u015bava dh\u1e5bta-nara-hari-r\u016bpa jaya jagad-\u012b\u015ba hare, ke\u015bava dh\u1e5bta-buddha-\u015bar\u012bra jaya jagad-\u012b\u015ba hare, etc.). Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu instructs us to follow the instructions of God\u2019s incarnations, especially K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is. Appreciating bhakti-m\u0101rga as instructed by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, S\u0101rvabhauma Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101c\u0101rya thus depicted the activities of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: \u201cLet me take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has descended in the form of Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu to teach us real knowledge, His devotional service, and detachment from whatever does not foster K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He has descended because He is an ocean of transcendental mercy. Let me surrender unto His lotus feet.\u201d (Caitanya-candrodaya-n\u0101\u1e6daka 6.74) In this Age of Kali, people cannot follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore the Lord Himself takes the part of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Caitanya to teach personally how to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. He asks everyone to follow Him and to become a guru to deliver the fallen souls of Kali-yuga. \u201cInstruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as they are given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land.\u201d (Cc. Madhya 7.128) The coherent purpose of Lord R\u0101macandra, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is to teach human society how to be happy by following the instructions of the Supreme Lord."
