The Lord is so merciful, however, that although Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not actually offer obeisances but only endeavored to do so within his mind, the Supreme Personality of Godhead blessed him with more mercy than even the demigods could ever expect. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.40), svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t: \u201cEven a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as bh\u0101va-gr\u0101h\u012b jan\u0101rdana because He takes only the essence of a devotee\u2019s attitude. If a devotee sincerely surrenders, the Lord, as the Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart, immediately understands this. Thus even though, externally, a devotee may not render full service, if he is internally sincere and serious the Lord welcomes his service nonetheless. Thus the Lord is known as bh\u0101va-gr\u0101h\u012b jan\u0101rdana because He takes the essence of one\u2019s devotional mentality."

As the Supersoul of all living entities, You are aware of everything, and therefore You are certainly equal toward everyone. Nonetheless, You favor Your devotees. This is not partiality, however, for Your characteristic is just like that of a desire tree, which yields everything according to one\u2019s desire.",
        "purport": " The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.29): \u201cI envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly equal toward all living entities, but a devotee who fully surrenders at the lotus feet of the Lord is different from a nondevotee. In other words, everyone can take shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord to enjoy equal benedictions from the Lord, but nondevotees do not do so, and therefore they suffer the consequences created by the material energy. We can understand this fact by a simple example. The king or government is equal to all citizens. Therefore, if a citizen capable of receiving special favors from the government is offered such favors, this does not mean that the government is partial. One who knows how to receive favors from the authority can receive them, but one who does not neglects these favors and does not receive them. There are two classes of men \u2014 the demons and the demigods. The demigods are fully aware of the Supreme Lord\u2019s position, and therefore they are obedient to Him, but even if demons know about the supremacy of the Lord they purposely defy His authority. Therefore, the Lord makes distinctions according to the mentality of the living being, but otherwise He is equal to everyone. Like a desire tree, the Lord fulfills the desires of one who takes shelter of Him, but one who does not take such shelter is distinct from the surrendered soul. One who takes shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord is favored by the Lord, regardless of whether such a person is a demon or a demigod."

There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.\u201d (B\u1e5bhan-n\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a 38.126) In this Age of Kali, it is extremely difficult to perform Vedic ritualistic ceremonies or sacrifices perfectly. Hardly anyone can chant the Vedic mantras with perfect pronunciation or accumulate the paraphernalia for Vedic performances. Therefore the sacrifice recommended in this age is sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord. Yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 11.5.29). Instead of wasting time performing Vedic sacrifices, those who are intelligent, those who possess good brain substance, should take to the chanting of the Lord\u2019s holy name and thus perform sacrifice perfectly. I have seen that many religious leaders are addicted to performing yaj\u00f1as and spending hundreds and thousands of rupees for imperfect sacrificial performances. This is a lesson for those who unnecessarily execute such imperfect sacrifices. We should take the advice of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu (yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25). Although \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya was a strict br\u0101hma\u1e47a addicted to ritualistic activities, he also admitted, ni\u015bchidram anusa\u1e45k\u012brtana\u1e41 tava: \u201cMy Lord, constant chanting of the holy name of Your Lordship makes everything perfect.\u201d In Kali-yuga the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies cannot be performed as perfectly as before. Therefore \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has recommended that although one should take care to follow all the principles in every kind of spiritual activity, especially in worship of the Deity, there is still a chance of discrepancies, and one should compensate for this by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement we therefore give special stress to the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra in all activities."

Yet this is only one fourth of God\u2019s creation. The other three fourths of creation constitute the spiritual world. Among the innumerable planets in only one universe, the so-called scientists cannot understand even the moon and Mars, but they try to defy the creation of the Supreme Lord and His uncommon energy.
