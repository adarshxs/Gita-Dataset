Similarly, He showed respect to Sud\u0101m\u0101 Vipra, a real br\u0101hma\u1e47a. From the Lord\u2019s personal activities, human society should learn how to give protection specifically to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and cows. Then the protection of religious principles, fulfillment of the aim of life and protection of Vedic knowledge can be achieved.

The Lord, therefore, is described as go-br\u0101hma\u1e47a-hit\u0101ya because His incarnation is only for the protection of the cows and br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Unfortunately, because in Kali-yuga there is no protection of the cows and brahminical culture, everything is in a precarious position. If human society wants to be exalted, the leaders of society must follow the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and give protection to the cows, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and brahminical culture."

        "purport": " The demigods like Indra, Candra and S\u016brya are ordinary living entities who are differentiated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord expands Himself through the living beings (nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13). His personal vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva forms, which are all spiritual, are called sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba, and the living entities who are differentiated parts are called vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba. Some of the vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba forms are spiritual, and some are a combination of matter and spirit. The conditioned souls in the material world are different from their external bodies made of material energy. Thus the demigods living in the upper planetary systems and the living entities living in the lower planetary system are of the same nature. Nonetheless, those living as human beings on this planet are sometimes attracted to worshiping the demigods in the higher planetary systems. Such worship is temporary. As the human beings on this planet have to change their bodies (tath\u0101 deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101pti\u1e25), the living entities known as Indra, Candra, Varu\u1e47a and so on will also have to change their bodies in due course of time. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, antavat tu phala\u1e41 te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 tad bhavaty alpa-medhas\u0101m: \u201cMen of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary.\u201d K\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante\u00a0\u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25: those who do not know the position of the demigods are inclined to worship the demigods for some material purpose, but the results of such worship are never permanent. Consequently, here it is said, yathetare\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 p\u1e5bthag-\u0101tman\u0101\u1e41 sat\u0101m, padopasarpa\u1e47a\u1e41 m\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101 bhavet. In other words, if one is to worship someone else, he must worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then his worship will never be fruitless. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t: even a slight attempt to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a permanent asset. Therefore, as recommended in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, tyaktv\u0101 sva-dharma\u1e41 cara\u1e47\u0101mbuja\u1e41 hare\u1e25. One should take to the worship of the lotus feet of Hari, even if this means giving up the so-called occupational duty assigned because of the particular body one has accepted. Because worship in terms of the body is temporary, it does not bear any permanent fruit. But worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives immense benefit."

        "purport": " This particular devastation actually took place not during the night of Lord Brahm\u0101 but during his day, for it was during the time of C\u0101k\u1e63u\u1e63a Manu. Brahm\u0101\u2019s night takes place when Brahm\u0101 goes to sleep, but in the daytime there are fourteen Manus, one of whom is C\u0101k\u1e63u\u1e63a Manu. Therefore, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments that although it was daytime for Lord Brahm\u0101, Brahm\u0101 felt sleepy for a short time by the supreme will of the Lord. This short period is regarded as Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s night. This has been elaborately discussed by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Laghu-bh\u0101gavat\u0101m\u1e5bta. The following is a summary of his analysis. Because Agastya Muni cursed Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu, during the time of Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu a devastation took place. This devastation is mentioned in the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a. During the time of C\u0101k\u1e63u\u1e63a Manu, by the supreme will of the Lord, there was suddenly another pralaya, or devastation. This is mentioned by M\u0101rka\u1e47\u1e0deya \u1e5a\u1e63i in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-dharmottara. At the end of Manu\u2019s time there is not necessarily a devastation, but at the end of the C\u0101k\u1e63u\u1e63a-manvantara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His illusory energy, wanted to show Satyavrata the effects of devastation. \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b also agrees with this opinion. The Laghu-bh\u0101gavat\u0101m\u1e5bta says:"

In all cases, however, He is the original spiritual master who enlightens the conditioned souls who are suffering in the material world. The Lord is always busy helping the conditioned souls in many ways. Therefore He is addressed here as paramo gurur bhav\u0101n. The representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who acts to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also guided by the Supreme Lord to act properly in executing the Lord\u2019s order. Such a person may appear to be an ordinary human being, but because he acts on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme spiritual master, he is not to be neglected as ordinary. It is therefore said, \u0101c\u0101rya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 vij\u0101n\u012by\u0101t: an \u0101c\u0101rya who acts on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be understood to be as good as the Supreme Lord Himself. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has advised that the spiritual master acting on the Supreme Lord\u2019s behalf must be worshiped as being as good as the Supreme Lord, for he is the Lord\u2019s most confidential servant in broadcasting the Lord\u2019s message for the benefit of the conditioned souls involved in the material world."

        "translation": "One who wants to be free of material entanglement should take to the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and give up the contamination of ignorance, involving pious and impious activities. Thus one regains his original identity, just as a block of gold or silver sheds all dirt and becomes purified when treated with fire. May that inexhaustible Supreme Personality of Godhead become our spiritual master, for He is the original spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.",
        "purport": " In human life one is meant to undergo austerity to purify one\u2019s existence. Tapo divya\u1e41 putrak\u0101 yena sattva\u1e41 \u015buddhyet. Because of contamination by the modes of material nature, one continues in the cycle of birth and death (k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go\u00a0\u2019sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu). Therefore the purpose of human life is to purify oneself of this contamination so that one can regain his spiritual form and not undergo this cycle of birth and death. The recommended process of decontamination is devotional service to the Lord. There are various processes for self-realization, such as karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga, but none of them is equal to the process of devotional service. As gold and silver can be freed from all dirty contamination by being put into a fire but not merely by being washed, the living entity can be awakened to his own identity by performing devotional service (yat-sevay\u0101), but not by karma, j\u00f1\u0101na or yoga. Cultivation of speculative knowledge or practice of yogic gymnastics will not be helpful. The word var\u1e47am refers to the luster of one\u2019s original identity. The original luster of gold or silver is brilliant. Similarly, the original luster of the living being, who is part of the sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, is the luster of \u0101nanda, or pleasure. \u0100nandamayo bhy\u0101s\u0101t. Every living entity has the right to become \u0101nandamaya, joyful, because he is part of the sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Why should the living being be put into tribulation because of dirty contamination by the material modes of nature? The living entity should become purified and regain his svar\u016bpa, his original identity. This he can do only by devotional service. Therefore, one should adopt the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described here as guror guru\u1e25, the spiritual master of all other spiritual masters. Even though we may not have the fortune to contact the Supreme Lord personally, the Lord\u2019s representative is as good as the Lord Himself because such a representative does not say anything unless it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore gives a definition of guru. Y\u0101re dekha, t\u0101re kaha\u00a0\u2018k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019-upade\u015ba: the bona fide guru is he who advises his disciples exactly in accordance with the principles spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The bona fide guru is he who has accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as guru. This is the guru-parampar\u0101 system. The original guru is Vy\u0101sadeva because he is the speaker of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, wherein everything spoken relates to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore guru-p\u016bj\u0101 is known as Vy\u0101sa-p\u016bj\u0101. In the final analysis, the original guru is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, His disciple is N\u0101rada, whose disciple is Vy\u0101sa, and in this way we gradually come in touch with the guru-parampar\u0101. One cannot become a guru if he does not know what the Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His incarnation wants. The mission of the guru is the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world."

Aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhavo matta\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 pravartate. All the gold mines are created by the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, why should one accept a magician who can manufacture only a small portion of gold? Such gurus are accepted by those who are blind, not knowing the goal of life. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Satyavrata, however, knew the goal of life. He knew the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he accepted the Lord as his guru. Either the Supreme Lord or His representative can become guru. The Lord says, m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te: \u201cOne can get relief from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 as soon as he surrenders unto Me.\u201d Therefore it is the guru\u2019s business to instruct his disciple to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he wants relief from the material clutches. This is the symptom of the guru. This same principle was instructed by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: y\u0101re dekha, t\u0101re kaha\u00a0\u2018k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019-upade\u015ba. In other words, one is advised not to accept a guru who does not follow the path of instruction given by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "purport": " So-called gurus instruct their disciples for the sake of material profit. Some guru advises that one meditate in such a way that his intelligence will increase in regard to keeping his body fit for sense gratification. Another guru advises that sex is the ultimate goal of life and that one should therefore engage in sex to the best of his ability. These are the instructions of foolish gurus. In other words, because of the instructions of a foolish guru one remains perpetually in material existence and suffers its tribulations. But if one is intelligent enough to take instructions from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as enunciated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy of Kapiladeva, one can very soon attain liberation and be situated in his original position of spiritual life. The words nija\u1e41 padam are significant. The living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has the birthright to a position in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, or the spiritual world, where there is no anxiety. Therefore, one should follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The Lord lives in the spiritual world in His original personality, and a devotee who follows the instructions of the Lord approaches Him (m\u0101m eti). As a spiritual person, such a devotee returns to the Personality of Godhead and plays and dances with Him. That is the ultimate goal of life."

        "purport": " Herein the reason for foolishness is described.

It is because of this foolishness that one cannot take instructions from the Lord, although the Lord is ready to instruct everyone both externally and internally. The Lord says, dad\u0101mi buddhi-yoga\u1e41 tam yena m\u0101m upay\u0101nti te. In other words, the Lord can give instructions on devotional service by which one can return home, back to Godhead. Unfortunately, however, people do not take this devotional service. The Lord, being situated in everyone\u2019s heart, can give one complete instructions on going back to Godhead, but because of lusty desires one engages himself in materialistic activities and does not render service to the Lord. Therefore one is bereft of the value of the Lord\u2019s instructions. By mental speculation one can understand that one is not the body but a spirit soul, but unless one engages in devotional service, the real purpose of life is never fulfilled. The real purpose of life is to go back home, back to Godhead, and live with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, play with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, dance with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and eat with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These are different items of \u0101nanda, spiritual happiness in spiritual variegatedness. Even though one may come to the platform of brahma-bh\u016bta. and understand his spiritual identity by speculative knowledge, one cannot enjoy spiritual life without understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is indicated here by the word abh\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da-siddhi\u1e25. One can fulfill the ultimate goal of life only by engaging in devotional service to the Lord. Then the Lord will give one proper instructions on how to go back home, back to Godhead."
