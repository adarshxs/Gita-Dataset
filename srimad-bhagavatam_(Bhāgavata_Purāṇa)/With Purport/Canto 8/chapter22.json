Although the Lord\u2019s purpose was to cheat him, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja took pleasure in understanding how the Lord will cheat His devotee to glorify the devotee\u2019s position. It is said that God is good, and this is a fact. Whether He cheats or rewards, He is always good. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore addressed Him as Uttama\u015bloka. \u201cYour Lordship,\u201d he said, \u201cYou are always praised with the best of selected verses. On behalf of the demigods, You disguised Yourself to cheat me, saying that You wanted only three paces of land, but later You expanded Your body to such an extent that with two footsteps You covered the entire universe. Because You were working on behalf of Your devotees, You do not regard this as cheating. Never mind. I cannot be considered a devotee. Nonetheless, because although You are the husband of the goddess of fortune You have come to me to beg, I must satisfy You to the best of my ability. So please do not think that I wanted to cheat You; I must fulfill my promise. I still have my body. When I place my body for Your satisfaction, please put Your third step on my head.\u201d Since the Lord had covered the entire universe with two steps, one might ask how Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s head could be sufficient for His third step? Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, thought that the possessor of wealth must be greater than the possession. Therefore although the Lord had taken all his possessions, the head of Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the possessor, would provide adequate place for the Lord\u2019s third step."

She is only the source of increasing material conditions. And what is the use of family, home, country and community? Attachment for them merely wastes the valuable energy of one\u2019s lifetime.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, advises, sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: \u201cGive up all other varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.\u201d The common man does not appreciate such a statement by the Supreme Personality of Godhead because he thinks that during his lifetime his family, society, country, body and relatives are everything. Why should one give up any one of them and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? But from the behavior of great personalities like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja we understand that surrendering to the Lord is the right action for an intelligent person. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja took shelter of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u against the will of his father. Similarly, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja took shelter of V\u0101manadeva against the will of his spiritual master, \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, and all the leading demons. People may be surprised that devotees like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja could seek shelter of the side of the enemy, giving up the natural affinity for family, hearth and home. In this connection, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja explains that the body, which is the center of all material activities, is also a foreign element. Even though we want to keep the body fit and helpful to our activities, the body cannot continue eternally. Although I am the soul, which is eternal, after using the body for some time I have to accept another body (tath\u0101 deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101pti\u1e25), according to the laws of nature, unless I render some service with the body for advancement in devotional service. One should not use the body for any other purpose. One must know that if he uses the body for any other purpose he is simply wasting time, for as soon as the time is ripe, the soul will automatically leave the body. We are very interested in society, friendship and love, but what are they? Those in the garb of friends and relatives merely plunder the hard-earned money of the bewildered soul. Everyone is affectionate toward his wife and is attached to her, but what is this wife? The wife is called str\u012b, which means, \u201cone who expands the material condition.\u201d If a person lives without a wife, his material conditions are less extensive. As soon as one marries and is connected with a wife, his material necessities increase. \u201cThe attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence. On the basis of this misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one increases life\u2019s illusions and thinks in terms of\u00a0\u2018I and mine.\u2019\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.5.8) Human life is meant for self-realization, not for increasing unwanted things. Actually, a wife increases unwanted things. One\u2019s lifetime, one\u2019s home and everything one has, if not properly used in the service of the Lord, are all sources of material conditions of perpetual suffering under the threefold miseries (adhy\u0101tmika, adhibhautika and adhidaivika). Unfortunately, there is no institution in human society for education on this subject. People are kept in darkness about the goal of life, and thus there is a continuous struggle for existence. We speak of \u201csurvival of the fittest,\u201d but no one survives, for no one is free under material conditions."

        "purport": " Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja appreciated the actions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although all the members of the demoniac families except Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja considered Vi\u1e63\u1e47u their eternal traditional enemy. As described by Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u was actually not the enemy of the family but the best friend of the family. The principle of this friendship has already been stated. Yasy\u0101ham anug\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101mi hari\u1e63ye tad-dhana\u1e41 \u015banai\u1e25: the Lord bestows special favor upon His devotee by taking away all his material opulences. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja appreciated this behavior by the Lord. Therefore he said, daivena n\u012bta\u1e25 prasabha\u1e41 ty\u0101jita-\u015br\u012b\u1e25: \u201cIt is to bring me to the right platform of eternal life that You have put me into these circumstances.\u201d Actually, everyone should fear the so-called society, friendship and love for which he works so hard all day and night. As indicated by Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja by the words jan\u0101d bh\u012bta\u1e25, every devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should always be afraid of the common man engaged in pursuing material prosperity. Such a person is described as pramatta, a madman chasing the will-o\u2019-the-wisp. Such men do not know that after a hard struggle for life one must change his body, with no certainty of what kind of body he will receive next. Those who are completely established in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious philosophy and who therefore understand the aim of life will never take to the activities of the materialistic dog race. But if a sincere devotee somehow does fall down, the Lord corrects him and saves him from gliding down to the darkest region of hellish life. The materialistic way of life is nothing but the repeated chewing of that which has already been chewed. Although there is no profit in such a life, people are enamored of it because of uncontrolled senses. N\u016bna\u1e41 pramatta\u1e25 kurute vikarma. Because of uncontrolled senses, people fully engage in sinful activities by which they get a body full of suffering. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja appreciated how the Lord had saved him from such a bewildered life of ignorance. He therefore said that his intelligence had been stunned. Stabdha-matir na budhyate. He could not understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead favors His devotees by forcibly stopping their materialistic activities."

It is by the mercy of the Lord that one gets all material opulence, but if such material opulence causes one to become puffed up and forget the process of self-realization, the Lord certainly takes all the opulence away. The Lord bestows mercy upon His devotee by helping him find out his constitutional position. For that purpose, the Lord is always ready to help the devotee in every way. But material opulence is sometimes dangerous because it diverts one\u2019s attention to false prestige by giving one the impression that he is the owner and master of everything he surveys, although actually this is not the fact. To protect the devotee from such a misunderstanding, the Lord, showing special mercy, sometimes takes away his material possessions.

Although the demigods, who are officials appointed by the Lord for management, are attached to materialistic enjoyment, they never claim to be proprietors of the universe, for they know that the actual proprietor of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the qualification of the demigods. But the demons, instead of accepting the exclusive proprietorship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, claim the property of the universe for themselves through demarcations of nationalism. \u201cThis part is mine, and that part is yours,\u201d they say. \u201cThis part I can give in charity, and this part I can keep for my enjoyment.\u201d These are all demoniac conceptions. This is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.13): idam adya may\u0101 labdham ima\u1e41 pr\u0101psye manoratham. \u201cThus far I have acquired so much money and land. Now I have to add more and more. In this way I shall be the greatest proprietor of everything. Who can compete with me?\u201d These are all demoniac conceptions. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s wife accused Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja by saying that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead had arrested him, showing him extraordinary mercy, and although Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was offering his body to the Supreme Lord for the Lord\u2019s third step, he was still in the darkness of ignorance. Actually the body did not belong to him, but because of his long-standing demoniac mentality he could not understand this. He thought that since he had been defamed for his inability to fulfill his promise of charity, and since the body belonged to him, he would free himself from defamation by offering his body. Actually, however, the body does not belong to anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whom the body is given. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61): The Lord is situated in the core of everyone\u2019s heart, and, according to the material desires of the living entity, the Lord offers a particular type of machine \u2014 the body \u2014 through the agency of the material energy. The body actually does not belong to the living entity; it belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Under the circumstances, how could Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja claim that the body belonged to him? Thus Vindhy\u0101vali, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s intelligent wife, prayed that her husband be released, by the Lord\u2019s causeless mercy. Otherwise, Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was nothing but a shameless demon, specifically described as tyakta-hriyas tvad-avaropita-kart\u1e5b-v\u0101d\u0101\u1e25, a foolish person claiming proprietorship over the property of the Supreme Person. In the present age, Kali-yuga, the number of such shameless men, who are agnostics disbelieving in the existence of God, has increased. Trying to defy the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so-called scientists, philosophers and politicians manufacture plans and schemes for the destruction of the world. They cannot do anything good for the world, and unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, they have plunged the affairs of the world into mismanagement. Thus there is a great need for the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement for the benefit of innocent people who are being carried away by propaganda of such demons. If the present status quo is allowed to continue, people will certainly suffer more and more under the leadership of these demoniac agnostics."

When a devotee is fixed in his devotional service, there is no need for the Lord to deprive him of his material opulences. The Supreme Personality of Godhead never takes away material opulences achieved because of devotional service, although He sometimes takes away opulences achieved by pious activities. He does this to make a devotee prideless or put him in a better position in devotional service. If a special devotee is meant for preaching but does not give up his family life or material opulences to take to the service of the Lord, the Lord surely takes away his material opulences and establishes him in devotional service.

        "purport": " Vi\u015bvakarm\u0101 is the engineer or architect for the palatial buildings in the heavenly planets. Therefore, since he was engaged to construct the residential quarters of Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the buildings and palaces on the planet Sutala must at least equal those on the heavenly planets. A further advantage of this place designed for Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was that he would not be disturbed by any outward calamity. Moreover, he would not be disturbed by mental or bodily miseries. These are all extraordinary features of the planet Sutala, where Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja would live. In the Vedic literatures we find descriptions of many different planets where there are many, many palaces, hundreds and thousands of times better than those of which we have experience on this planet earth. When we speak of palaces, this naturally includes the idea of great cities and towns. Unfortunately, when modern scientists try to explore other planets they see nothing but rocks and sand. Of course, they may go on their frivolous excursions, but the students of the Vedic literature will never believe them or give them any credit for exploring other planets."
