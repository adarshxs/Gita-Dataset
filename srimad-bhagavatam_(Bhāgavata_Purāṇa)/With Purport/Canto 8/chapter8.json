These cows are the Lord\u2019s pet animals. From the surabhi cows one can take as much milk as one needs, and one may milk these cows as many times as he desires. In other words, the surabhi cow can yield milk unlimitedly. Milk is necessary for the performance of yaj\u00f1a. Sages know how to use milk to elevate human society to the perfection of life. Since cow protection is recommended everywhere in the \u015b\u0101stras, the brahm\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs took charge of the surabhi cow, in which the demons were not very interested."

People generally desire material enjoyment, material opulence and the association of aristocratic family members (bhogai\u015bvarya-prasakt\u0101n\u0101m). Material enjoyment entails money, beauty and the reputation they bring, which can all be achieved by the mercy of the goddess of fortune. The goddess of fortune, however, never remains alone. As indicated in the previous verse by the word bhagavat-par\u0101, she is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is enjoyable only by Him. If one wants the favor of the goddess of fortune, mother Lak\u1e63m\u012b, because she is by nature bhagavat-par\u0101 one must keep her with N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. The devotees who always engage in the service of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101ya\u1e47a) can easily achieve the favor of the goddess of fortune without a doubt, but materialists who try to get the favor of the goddess of fortune only to possess her for personal enjoyment are frustrated. Theirs is not a good policy. The celebrated demon R\u0101va\u1e47a, for example, wanted to deprive R\u0101macandra of Lak\u1e63m\u012b, S\u012bt\u0101, and thus be victorious, but the result was just the opposite. S\u012bt\u0101, of course, was taken by force by Lord R\u0101macandra, and R\u0101va\u1e47a and his entire material empire were vanquished. The goddess of fortune is desirable for everyone, including human beings, but one should understand that the goddess of fortune is the exclusive property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One cannot achieve the mercy of the goddess of fortune unless one prays both to her and to the supreme enjoyer, the Personality of Godhead."

In someone, whether human or demigod, there may be renunciation, but that is not the cause of liberation. Someone may possess great power and yet be unable to check the power of eternal time. Someone else may have renounced attachment to the material world, yet he cannot compare to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, no one is completely freed from the influence of the material modes of nature.",
        "purport": " The statement dharma\u1e25 kvacit tatra na bh\u016bta-sauh\u1e5bdam is very important in this verse. We actually see that there are many Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and religionists of other cults who adhere to their religious principles very nicely but are not equal to all living entities. Indeed, although they profess to be very religious, they kill poor animals. Such religion has no meaning. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.8) says: One may be very expert in following the religious principles of his own sect, but if he has no tendency to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his observance of religious principles is simply a waste of time. One must develop a sense of loving V\u0101sudeva (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25). The sign of a devotee is that he is a friend to everyone (suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m). A devotee will never allow a poor animal to be killed in the name of religion. This is the difference between a superficially religious person and a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We find that there have been many great heroes in history, but they could not escape from the cruel hands of death. Even the greatest hero cannot escape from the ruling power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes as death. That is described by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself: m\u1e5btyu\u1e25 sarva-hara\u015b c\u0101ham. The Lord, appearing as death, takes away a hero\u2019s so-called power. Even Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu could not be saved when N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva appeared before him as death. One\u2019s material strength is nothing before the strength of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

The first concern of a nondevotee is how to enjoy his personal sense gratification at once, whereas the devotee\u2019s first concern is to satisfy the Lord. This is the distinction between the nondevotee and the devotee. In this material world, since most people are nondevotees, they regularly compete, fight, disagree and war among themselves, for everyone wants to enjoy and satisfy his own senses. Therefore, unless such demons become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and are trained to satisfy the senses of the Lord, there can be no question of peace in human society or any society, even that of the demigods. The demigods and devotees, however, always surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus the Lord is always anxious to satisfy their ambitions. While the demons fight to satisfy their own senses, devotees engage in devotional service to satisfy the senses of the Lord. The members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement must be alert in regard to this point, and then their preaching of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement will be successful."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who can counteract any unfavorable situation, then assumed the form of an extremely beautiful woman. This incarnation as a woman, Mohin\u012b-m\u016brti, was most pleasing to the mind. Her complexion resembled in color a newly grown blackish lotus, and every part of Her body was beautifully situated. Her ears were equally decorated with earrings, Her cheeks were very beautiful, Her nose was raised and Her face full of youthful luster. Her large breasts made Her waist seem very thin. Attracted by the aroma of Her face and body, bumblebees hummed around Her, and thus Her eyes were restless. Her hair, which was extremely beautiful, was garlanded with mallik\u0101 flowers. Her attractively constructed neck was decorated with a necklace and other ornaments, Her arms were decorated with bangles, Her body was covered with a clean sari, and Her breasts seemed like islands in an ocean of beauty. Her legs were decorated with ankle bells. Because of the movements of Her eyebrows as She smiled with shyness and glanced over the demons, all the demons were saturated with lusty desires, and every one of them desired to possess Her.",
