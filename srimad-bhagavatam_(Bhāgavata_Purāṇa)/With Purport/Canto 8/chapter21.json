The Lord can assume any form He likes, but His original form is that of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam). According to the capacity of the devotee, the Lord assumes various forms so that the devotee can handle Him. This is His causeless mercy. When Lord V\u0101manadeva resumed His original form, Lord Brahm\u0101 and his associates collected various paraphernalia for worship with which to please Him."

A devotee actually lives transcendentally. Although he may appear to have gone to hell or heaven, he does not live in either place; rather, he always lives in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha (sa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate).

        "translation": "Being falsely proud of your possessions, you promised to give Me land, but you could not fulfill your promise. Therefore, because your promise was false, you must live for a few years in hellish life.",
        "purport": " The false prestige of thinking \u201cI am very rich, and I possess such vast property\u201d is another side of material life. Everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one else possesses anything. This is the real fact. \u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sama\u1e41 yat ki\u00f1ca jagaty\u0101\u1e41 jagat. Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was undoubtedly the most exalted devotee, whereas previously he had maintained a misunderstanding due to false prestige. By the supreme will of the Lord, he now had to go to the hellish planets, but because he went there by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he lived there more opulently than one could expect to live in the planets of heaven. A devotee always lives with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, engaging in His service, and therefore he is always transcendental to hellish or heavenly residences."
