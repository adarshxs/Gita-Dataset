The curse of such a personality, however, is in fact a benediction. Both the crocodile, who had been a Gandharva in his previous life, and Gajendra, who had been a king named Indradyumna, were cursed, but both of them benefited. Indradyumna, in his birth as an elephant, attained salvation and became a personal associate of the Lord in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, and the crocodile regained his status as a Gandharva. We find evidence in many places that the curse of a great saint or devotee is not a curse but a benediction."

Although the King was cursed, he welcomed the curse because a devotee is always aware that nothing can happen without the desire of the Supreme Lord.

Tat te\u00a0\u2019nukamp\u0101\u1e41 susam\u012bk\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.8). This is a practical example of how a devotee thinks. He regards any reverses in life as blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, instead of being agitated by such reverses, he continues his activities of devotional service, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a takes care of him and enables him to be promoted to the spiritual world, back to Godhead. If a devotee has to suffer the reactions of his past misdeeds, the Supreme Lord arranges for him to be given only a token of these reactions, and very soon he is freed from all the reactions of material contamination. One should therefore adhere to devotional service, and the Lord Himself will very soon see to one\u2019s promotion to the spiritual world. A devotee should not be disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but must continue his regular program, depending on the Lord for everything. The word upadh\u0101rayan, \u201cconsidering,\u201d is very significant in this verse. This word indicates that a devotee knows what is what; he understands what is happening in material, conditional life."

        "translation": "Upon delivering the King of the elephants from the clutches of the crocodile, and from material existence, which resembles a crocodile, the Lord awarded him the status of s\u0101r\u016bpya-mukti. In the presence of the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and the other demigods, who were praising the Lord for His wonderful transcendental activities, the Lord, sitting on the back of His carrier, Garu\u1e0da, returned to His all-wonderful abode and took Gajendra with Him.",
        "purport": " In this verse the word vimok\u1e63ya is significant. For a devotee, mok\u1e63a or mukti \u2014 salvation \u2014 means getting the position of the Lord\u2019s associate. The impersonalists are satisfied to get the liberation of merging in the Brahman effulgence, but for a devotee, mukti (liberation) means not to merge in the effulgence of the Lord, but to be directly promoted to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets and to become an associate of the Lord. In this regard, there is a relevant verse in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.8): \u201cOne who seeks Your compassion and thus tolerates all kinds of adverse conditions due to the karma of his past deeds, who engages always in Your devotional service with his mind, words and body, and who always offers obeisances unto You, is certainly a bona fide candidate for liberation.\u201d A devotee who tolerates everything in this material world and patiently executes his devotional service can become mukti-pade sa d\u0101ya-bh\u0101k, a bona fide candidate for liberation. The word d\u0101ya-bh\u0101k refers to a hereditary right to the Lord\u2019s mercy. A devotee must simply engage in devotional service, not caring about material situations. Then he automatically becomes a rightful candidate for promotion to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. The devotee who renders unalloyed service to the Lord gets the right to be promoted to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka, just as a son inherits the property of his father. When a devotee gets liberation, he becomes free from material contamination and engages as a servant of the Lord. This is explained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.10.6): muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101 r\u016bpa\u1e41 svar\u016bpena vyavasthiti\u1e25. The word svar\u016bpa refers to s\u0101r\u016bpya-mukti \u2014 going back home, back to Godhead, and remaining the Lord\u2019s eternal associate, having regained a spiritual body exactly resembling that of the Lord, with four hands, holding the \u015ba\u1e45kha, cakra, gad\u0101 and padma. The difference between the mukti of the impersonalist and that of the devotee is that the devotee is immediately appointed an eternal servant of the Lord, whereas the impersonalist, although merging in the effulgence of the brahmajyoti, is still insecure and therefore generally falls again to this material world. \u0100ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25 patanty adho\u00a0\u2019n\u0101d\u1e5bta-yu\u1e63mad-a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.2.32). Although the impersonalist rises to the Brahman effulgence and enters into that effulgence, he has no engagement in the service of the Lord, and therefore he is again attracted to materialistic philanthropic activities. Thus he comes down to open hospitals and educational institutions, feed poor men and perform similar materialistic activities, which the impersonalist thinks are more precious than serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. An\u0101d\u1e5bta-yu\u1e63mad-a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25. The impersonalists do not think that the service of the Lord is more valuable than serving the poor man or starting a school or hospital. Although they say brahma satya\u1e41 jagan mithy\u0101 \u2014 \u201cBrahman is real, and the material world is false\u201d \u2014 they are nonetheless very eager to serve the false material world and neglect the service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " Every verse in the Vedic literature, especially in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is a Vedic mantra. Here the words yath\u0101nuk\u012brtayanti are used to recommend that this literature be presented as it is. Unscrupulous persons, however, deviate from the actual narration and interpret the text in their own way with grammatical jugglery. Such deviations are to be avoided. This is a Vedic injunction supported by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, one of the mah\u0101janas, or authorities. He says, yath\u0101nuk\u012brtayanti: one should recite the mantra as it is, without deviation, for then one will be eligible to rise to the platform of all good fortune. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b especially recommends that those who are br\u0101hma\u1e47as (\u015bucaya\u1e25) recite all these mantras after rising from bed in the morning. Because of sinful activities, at night we have bad dreams, which are very troublesome. Indeed, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was obliged to see hell because of a slight deviation from devotional service to the Lord. Therefore, du\u1e25svapna \u2014 bad dreams \u2014 occur because of sinful activities. A devotee sometimes accepts a sinful person as his disciple, and to counteract the sinful reactions he accepts from the disciple, he has to see a bad dream. Nonetheless, the spiritual master is so kind that in spite of having bad dreams due to the sinful disciple, he accepts this troublesome business for the deliverance of the victims of Kali-yuga. After initiation, therefore, a disciple should be extremely careful not to commit again any sinful act that might cause difficulties for himself and the spiritual master. Before the Deity, before the fire, before the spiritual master and before the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, the honest disciple promises to refrain from all sinful activity. Therefore he must not again commit sinful acts and thus create a troublesome situation."
