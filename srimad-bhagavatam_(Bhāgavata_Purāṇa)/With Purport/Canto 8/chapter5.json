Jaya, as Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a, had to fight with Var\u0101hadeva, and that same Var\u0101hadeva is mentioned in regard to the Raivata millennium.

According to others, however, Var\u0101ha appeared during the regime of Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu and stayed in the water until that of Raivata Manu. Some may doubt that this could be possible, but the answer is that everything is possible. If one could count the atoms within the universe, one could count the qualities of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

Indeed, they could not be revived. At that time, O King, the demigods had been cursed by Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, the three worlds were poverty-stricken, and therefore ritualistic ceremonies could not be performed. The effects of this were very serious.",
        "purport": " It is described that while Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni was passing on the road, he saw Indra on the back of his elephant and was pleased to offer Indra a garland from his own neck. Indra, however, being too puffed up, took the garland, and without respect for Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, he placed it on the trunk of his carrier elephant. The elephant, being an animal, could not understand the value of the garland, and thus the elephant threw the garland between its legs and smashed it. Seeing this insulting behavior, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni immediately cursed Indra to be poverty-stricken, bereft of all material opulence. Thus the demigods, afflicted on one side by the fighting demons and on the other by the curse of Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, lost all the material opulences in the three worlds. To be extremely opulent in materialistic advancement is sometimes very risky. The materially opulent person does not care about anyone, and thus he commits offenses to great personalities, such as devotees and great saints. This is the way of material opulence. As described by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, dhana-durmad\u0101ndha: too much wealth makes one blind. This happens even to Indra in his heavenly kingdom, and what to speak of others in this material world? When one is materially opulent, he should learn to be sober and well-behaved toward Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and saintly persons; otherwise he will fall down."

Actually, however, He is unaffected by these modes of material nature. He is the Supreme Lord of everyone. As a king sometimes punishes or rewards someone to maintain law and order, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although having nothing to do with the activities of this material world, sometimes appears as various incarnations according to the time, place and object."

        "translation": "Now is the time to invoke the mode of goodness of the living entities who have accepted material bodies. The mode of goodness is meant to establish the Supreme Lord\u2019s rule, which will maintain the existence of the creation. Therefore, this is the opportune moment to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because He is naturally very kind and dear to the demigods, He will certainly bestow good fortune upon us.",
        "purport": " The material world is conducted by the three modes of nature, namely sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a. By rajo-gu\u1e47a everything material is created, by sattva-gu\u1e47a everything material is maintained properly, and by tamo-gu\u1e47a, when the creation is improperly situated, everything is destroyed. From this verse we can understand the situation of Kali-yuga, through which we are now passing. Just before the beginning of Kali-yuga \u2014 or, in other words, at the end of Dv\u0101para-yuga \u2014 Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared and left His instructions in the form of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, in which He asked all living entities to surrender unto Him. Since the beginning of Kali-yuga, however, people have practically been unable to surrender to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore, after some five thousand years, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a came again as \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu just to teach the entire world how to surrender unto Him, unto \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus be purified. Surrendering unto the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means achieving complete purification. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\u201d Thus as soon as one surrenders unto the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one certainly becomes free from all contamination. Kali-yuga is full of contamination. This is described in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.3.51): This Age of Kali is full of unlimited faults. Indeed, it is just like an ocean of faults (do\u1e63a-nidhi). But there is one chance, one opportunity. K\u012brtan\u0101d eva k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47asya mukta-sa\u1e45ga\u1e25 para\u1e41 vrajet: simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, one can be freed from the contamination of Kali-yuga and, in his original spiritual body, can return home, back to Godhead. This is the opportunity of Kali-yuga. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared, He gave His orders, and when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself appeared as a devotee, as \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, He showed us the path by which to cross the ocean of Kali-yuga. That is the path of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement. When \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu appeared, He ushered in the era for the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement. It is also said that for ten thousand years this era will continue. This means that simply by accepting the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement and chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, the fallen souls of this Kali-yuga will be delivered. After the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, at which Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken, Kali-yuga continues for 432,000 years, of which only 5,000 years have passed. Thus there is still a balance of 427,000 years to come. Of these 427,000 years, the 10,000 years of the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement inaugurated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu 500 years ago provide the opportunity for the fallen souls of Kali-yuga to take to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra and thus be delivered from the clutches of material existence and return home, back to Godhead. Chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra is potent always, but it is especially potent in this Age of Kali. Therefore \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, while instructing Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, stressed this chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. \u201cMy dear King, although Kali-yuga is full of faults, there is still one good quality about this age. It is that simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 12.3.51) Those who have accepted the task of spreading the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should take this opportunity to deliver people very easily from the clutches of material existence. Our duty, therefore, is to follow the instructions of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and preach the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement all over the world very sincerely. This is the best welfare activity for the peace and prosperity of human society. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s movement consists of spreading k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtana. Para\u1e41 vijayate \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtanam: \u201cAll glories to the \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sa\u1e45k\u012brtana!\u201d Why is it so glorious? This has also been explained by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam: by the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, one\u2019s heart is cleansed. The whole difficulty is that in this Age of Kali there is no sattva-gu\u1e47a and no clearance of the heart, and therefore people are making the mistake of identifying with their bodies. Even the big philosophers and scientists with whom we deal are practically all under the impression that they are their bodies. The other day we were discussing a prominent philosopher, Thomas Huxley, who was proud of being an Englishman. This means that he was in the bodily conception of life. Everywhere we find this same misunderstanding. As soon as one is in the bodily conception of life, one is nothing but an animal like a cat or a dog (sa eva go-khara\u1e25). Thus the most dangerous of the dirty things within our hearts is this misidentification of the body as the self. Under the influence of this misunderstanding, one thinks, \u201cI am this body. I am an Englishman. I am an Indian. I am an American. I am Hindu. I am Muslim.\u201d This misconception is the strongest impediment, and it must be removed. That is the instruction of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Indeed, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 begins with this instruction: \u201cAs the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d (Bg. 2.13) Although the soul is within the body, nevertheless, because of misunderstanding and animal propensities one accepts the body as the self. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore says, ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam. To cleanse the core of the heart, which is full of misunderstanding, is possible only through \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtana. The leaders of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement should very seriously take this opportunity to be kind to the fallen souls by delivering them from the misunderstanding of materialistic life. One cannot be happy in any way within this material world. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.16): \u201cFrom the highest planet in this material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place.\u201d Therefore, not to speak of going to the moon, even if one is promoted to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, there cannot be any happiness in this material world. If one actually wants happiness, one must go to the spiritual world. The material world is characterized by a struggle for existence, and survival of the fittest is a well-known principle, but the poor souls of this material world do not know what is survival and who is fit. Survival does not mean that one should die; survival means that one should not die, but should enjoy an everlastingly blissful life of knowledge. This is survival. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is meant to make every person fit for survival. Indeed, it is meant to stop the struggle for existence. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 give definite directions on how to stop the struggle for existence and how to survive in eternal life. The sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement, therefore, is a great opportunity. Simply by hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, one becomes completely purified. Thus the struggle for existence ceases, and one goes back home, back to Godhead."

The Lord\u2019s abode is on an island called \u015avetadv\u012bpa, which is situated in the Ocean of Milk.",
        "purport": " Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it is addressed here as arindama, \u201csubduer of all enemies.\u201d Not only do we have enemies outside of our bodies, but within our bodies there are many enemies, such as lusty desires, anger and greed. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it is specifically addressed as arindama because in his political life he was able to subdue all kinds of enemies, and even though he was a young king, as soon as he heard that he was going to die within seven days, he immediately left his kingdom. He did not follow the dictates of enemies within his body, such as lust, greed and anger. He was not at all angry with the muni\u2019s son who had cursed him. Rather, he accepted the curse and prepared for his death in the association of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. Death is inevitable; no one can surpass the force of death. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, while fully alive, wanted to hear \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. He is consequently addressed here as arindama. Another word, sura-priya, is also significant. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is equal toward everyone, He is especially inclined toward His devotees (ye bhajanti tu m\u0101\u1e41 bhakty\u0101 mayi te te\u1e63u c\u0101py aham). The devotees are all demigods. There are two kinds of men within this world. One is called the deva, and the other is called the asura. The Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a states: Anyone who is a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called a deva, and others, even though they may be devotees of demigods, are called asuras. R\u0101va\u1e47a, for example, was a great devotee of Lord \u015aiva, but he is described as an asura. Similarly, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu is described as a great devotee of Lord Brahm\u0101, yet he was also an asura. Therefore, only the devotee of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is called sura, not asura. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very much pleased with His devotees, even if they are not on the topmost stage of devotional service. Even on the lower stages of devotional service one is transcendental, and if one continues with devotional life, he continues to be a deva or sura. If one continues in this way, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will always be pleased with him and will give him all instructions so that he may very easily return home, back to Godhead. Concerning ajitasya padam, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Milk Ocean of this material world, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says: pada\u1e41 k\u1e63\u012brodadhi-stha-\u015bvetadv\u012bpa\u1e41 tamasa\u1e25 prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 param. The island known as \u015avetadv\u012bpa, which is in the Ocean of Milk, is transcendental. It has nothing to do with this material world. A city government may have a rest house where the governor and important government officers stay. Such a rest house is not an ordinary house. Similarly, although \u015avetadv\u012bpa, which is in the Ocean of Milk, is in this material world, it is para\u1e41 padam, transcendental."

Simply because Lord Brahm\u0101 had heard about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from Vedic literature, with a fixed mind he offered the Lord prayers as written or approved by Vedic literature.",
        "purport": " It is said that when Brahm\u0101 and the other demigods go to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in \u015avetadv\u012bpa, they cannot directly see Him, but their prayers are heard by the Lord, and the needful action is taken. This we have seen in many instances. The word \u015bruta-p\u016brv\u0101ya is significant. We get experience by directly seeing or by hearing. If it is not possible to see someone directly, we can hear about him from authentic sources. Sometimes people ask whether we can show them God. This is ludicrous. It is not necessary for one to see God before he can accept God. Our sensory perception is always incomplete. Therefore, even if we see God, we may not be able to understand Him. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was on earth, many, many people saw Him but could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam. Even though the rascals and fools saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally, they could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even upon seeing God personally, one who is unfortunate cannot understand Him. Therefore we have to hear about God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, from the authentic Vedic literature and from persons who understand the Vedic version properly. Even though Brahm\u0101 had not seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead before, he was confident that the Lord was there in \u015avetadv\u012bpa. Thus he took the opportunity to go there and offer prayers to the Lord. These prayers were not ordinary concocted prayers. Prayers must be approved by Vedic literature, as indicated in this verse by the words daiv\u012bbhir g\u012brbhi\u1e25. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement we do not allow any song that has not been approved or sung by bona fide devotees. We cannot allow cinema songs to be sung in the temple. We generally sing two songs. One is \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-caitanya prabhu nity\u0101nanda \u015br\u012b-advaita gad\u0101dhara \u015br\u012bv\u0101s\u0101di-gaura-bhakta-v\u1e5bnda. This is bona fide. It is always mentioned in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, and it is accepted by the \u0101c\u0101ryas. The other, of course, is the mah\u0101-mantra \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. We may also sing the songs of Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura and Locana d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, but these two songs \u2014 \u201c\u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-caitanya\u201d and the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra \u2014 are sufficient to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although we cannot see Him. Seeing the Lord is not as important as appreciating Him from the authentic literature or the authentic statements of authorized persons."

        "translation": "Lord Brahm\u0101 said: O Supreme Lord, O changeless, unlimited supreme truth. You are the origin of everything. Being all-pervading, You are in everyone\u2019s heart and also in the atom. You have no material qualities. Indeed, You are inconceivable. The mind cannot catch You by speculation, and words fail to describe You. You are the supreme master of everyone, and therefore You are worshipable for everyone. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not anything of material creation. Everything material must change from one form to another \u2014 for example, from earth to earthen pot and from earthen pot to earth again. All our creations are temporary, impermanent. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is eternal, and similarly the living entities, who are parts of Him, are also eternal (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25). The Supreme Personality of Godhead is san\u0101tana, eternal, and the individual living entities are also eternal. The difference is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God, is the supreme eternal, whereas the individual souls are minute, fragmental eternals. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.3), k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a\u1e41 c\u0101pi m\u0101\u1e41 viddhi sarva-k\u1e63etre\u1e63u bh\u0101rata. Although the Lord is a living being and the individual souls are living beings, the Supreme Lord, unlike the individual souls, is vibhu, all-pervading, and ananta, unlimited. The Lord is the cause of everything. The living entities are innumerable, but the Lord is one. No one is greater than Him, and no one is equal to Him. Thus the Lord is the supreme worshipable object, as understood from the Vedic mantras (na tat-sama\u015b c\u0101bhyadhika\u015b ca d\u1e5b\u015byate). The Lord is supreme because no one can evaluate Him by mental speculation or jugglery of words. The Lord can travel more quickly than the mind. In the \u015bruti-mantras of \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad it is said: \u201cAlthough fixed in His abode, the Personality of Godhead is swifter than the mind and can overcome all others running. The powerful demigods cannot approach Him. Although in one place, He controls those who supply the air and rain. He surpasses all in excellence.\u201d (\u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad 4) Thus the Supreme is never to be equaled by the subordinate living entities. Because the Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart and the individual living entity is not, never should the individual living entity be equated with the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15) the Lord says, sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25: \u201cI am situated in everyone\u2019s heart.\u201d This does not mean, however, that everyone is equal to the Lord. In the \u015bruti-mantras it is also said, h\u1e5bdi hy ayam \u0101tm\u0101 prati\u1e63\u1e6dhita\u1e25. In the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said, satya\u1e41 para\u1e41 dh\u012bmahi. The Vedic mantras say, satya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam anantam and ni\u1e63kala\u1e41 ni\u1e63kriya\u1e41 \u015b\u0101nta\u1e41 niravadyam. God is supreme. Although naturally He does not do anything, He is doing everything. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cBy Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.\u201d (Bg. 9.4) \u201cThis material nature, working under My direction, O son of Kunt\u012b, is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.\u201d (Bg. 9.10) Thus although the Lord is silent in His abode, He is doing everything through His different energies (par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate). All the Vedic mantras, or \u015bruti-mantras, are included in this verse spoken by Lord Brahm\u0101, for Brahm\u0101 and his followers, the Brahma samprad\u0101ya, understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the parampar\u0101 system. We have to gain understanding through the words of our predecessors. There are twelve mah\u0101janas, or authorities, of whom Brahm\u0101 is one. We belong to the disciplic succession of Brahm\u0101, and therefore we are known as the Brahma samprad\u0101ya. As the demigods follow Lord Brahm\u0101 to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we also have to follow the authorities of the parampar\u0101 system to understand the Lord."

He is the illuminator of everything and has no ignorance. He does not have a material body subject to the reactions of previous activities, and He is free from the ignorance of partiality and materialistic education. I therefore take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, who is eternal, all-pervading and as great as the sky and who appears with six opulences in three yugas [Satya, Tret\u0101 and Dv\u0101para].",
        "purport": " In the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described in this way: janm\u0101dy asya yato \u2019nvay\u0101d itarata\u015b c\u0101rthe\u1e63v abhij\u00f1a\u1e25. The Lord is the origin of all emanations, and He directly and indirectly knows everything about all the activities within His creation. Therefore the Lord is addressed here as vipa\u015bcitam, one who is full of all knowledge or who knows everything. The Lord is the Supreme Soul, and He knows everything about the living entities and their senses. The word anidram, meaning \u201calways awake and free from ignorance,\u201d is very important in this verse. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca: it is the Lord who gives intelligence to everyone and who causes everyone to forget. There are millions and millions of living entities, and the Lord gives them directions. Therefore He has no time to sleep, and He is never in ignorance of our activities. The Lord is the witness of everything; He sees what we are doing at every moment. The Lord is not covered by a body resulting from karma. Our bodies are formed as a result of our past deeds (karma\u1e47\u0101 daiva-netre\u1e47a), but the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not have a material body, and therefore He has no avidy\u0101, ignorance. He does not sleep, but is always alert and awake. The Supreme Lord is described as tri-yuga because although He appeared variously in Satya-yuga, Tret\u0101-yuga and Dv\u0101para-yuga, when He appeared in Kali-yuga He never declared Himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord appears in Kali-yuga as a devotee. Thus although He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra like a devotee. Still, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.32) recommends: \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, whose complexion is not black like that of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but is golden (tvi\u1e63\u0101k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47am), is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is accompanied by associates like Nity\u0101nanda, Advaita, Gad\u0101dhara and \u015ar\u012bv\u0101sa. Those who are sufficiently intelligent worship this Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. In this incarnation, the Supreme Lord declares Himself not to be the Supreme Lord, and therefore He is known as Tri-yuga."

Every one of us, therefore, should offer respectful obeisances to this central reality. One should not be misguided by the activities of this material world and forget the central point, the Absolute Truth. That is the instruction given here by Lord Brahm\u0101."

In this material world, the three modes of material nature \u2014 goodness, passion and ignorance \u2014 prevail. Among these three, goodness is the platform of knowledge, and passion brings about a mixture of knowledge and ignorance, but the mode of ignorance is full of darkness. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is beyond darkness and passion. He is on the platform where goodness or knowledge is not disturbed by passion and ignorance. This is called the vasudeva platform. It is on this platform of vasudeva that V\u0101sudeva, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can appear. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared on this planet as the son of Vasudeva. Because the Lord is situated beyond the three modes of material nature, He is unseen by those who are dominated by these three modes. One must therefore become dh\u012bra, or undisturbed by the modes of material nature. The process of yoga may be practiced by one who is free from the agitation of these modes. Therefore yoga is defined in this way: yoga indriya-sa\u1e41yama\u1e25. As previously explained, we are disturbed by the indriyas, or senses. Moreover, we are agitated by the three modes of material nature, which are imposed upon us by the external energy. In conditional life, the living entity moves turbulently in the whirlpool of birth and death, but when one is situated on the transcendental platform of vi\u015buddha-sattva, pure goodness, he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who sits on the back of Garu\u1e0da. Lord Brahm\u0101 offers his respectful obeisances unto that Supreme Lord."

Thus every living being is illusioned by the external energy of the Supreme Lord.

At the time of death, their attempts to use their so-called scientific knowledge and philosophical speculation to deny the supremacy of the Lord cannot work. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, for example, was an exalted representative of the atheistic class of men. He always challenged the existence of God, and thus he became inimical even toward his own son. Everyone was afraid of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s atheistic principles.

Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva killed Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and took away all his power, influence and pride. Atheistic men, however, never understand how everything they create is annihilated. The Supersoul is situated within them, but because of the predominance of the modes of passion and ignorance, they cannot understand the supremacy of the Lord. Even the demigods, the devotees, who are transcendentally situated or situated on the platform of goodness, are not fully aware of the qualities and position of the Lord.

This much we can learn, but how it is happening is extremely difficult to understand. We cannot even understand how the affairs within our body are systematically taking place. The body is a small universe, and since we cannot understand how things are happening in this small universe, how can we understand the affairs of the bigger universe? Actually this universe is very difficult to understand, yet learned sages have advised, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has also advised, that this material world is du\u1e25kh\u0101layam a\u015b\u0101\u015bvatam; in other words, it is a place of misery and temporality. One must give up this world and go back home, back to the Personality of Godhead. Materialists may argue, \u201cIf this material world and its affairs are impossible to understand, how can we reject it?\u201d The answer is provided by the word prabudh\u0101pab\u0101dham. We have to reject this material world because it is rejected by those who are learned in Vedic wisdom. Even though we cannot understand what this material world is, we should be ready to reject it in accordance with the advice of learned persons, especially the advice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cAfter attaining Me, the great souls, who are yog\u012bs in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.\u201d (Bg. 8.15) One has to return home, back to Godhead, for this is the highest perfection of life. To go back to Godhead means to reject this material world. Although we cannot understand the functions of this material world and whether it is good for us or bad for us, in accordance with the advice of the supreme authority we must reject it and go back home, back to Godhead."

The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is not very popular with the karm\u012bs because this movement recommends that one refrain from illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. These are restrictions that karm\u012bs very much dislike. Nonetheless, in the presence of so many enemies, this movement is progressing, going forward without impediments. If the devotees continue to spread this movement, dedicating life and soul to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, no one will be able to check it. The movement will go forward without limits. Chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a!"

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.40), the Lord says svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t: this dharma, devotional service, is so important that even if performed to a very small, almost negligible extent, it can give one the supreme result. There are many instances in the history of the world in which even a slight service rendered to the Lord has saved a living entity from the greatest danger. Aj\u0101mila, for example, was saved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the greatest danger, that of going to hell. He was saved simply because he chanted the name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at the end of his life. When Aj\u0101mila chanted this holy name of the Lord, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, he did not chant knowingly; actually he was calling his youngest son, whose name was N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Nonetheless, Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a took this chanting seriously, and thus Aj\u0101mila achieved the result of ante n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-sm\u1e5bti\u1e25, remembering N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at the end of life. If one somehow or other remembers the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or R\u0101ma at the end of life, he immediately achieves the transcendental result of going back home, back to Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the only object of our love. As long as we are in this material world we have so many desires to fulfill, but when we come in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we immediately become perfect and fully satisfied, just as a child is fully satisfied when he comes to the lap of his mother. Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja went to the forest to achieve some material result by austerity and penance, but when he actually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead he said, \u201cI do not want any material benediction. I am completely satisfied.\u201d Even if one wants some material benefit from serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this can be achieved extremely easily, without hard labor. Therefore the \u015b\u0101stra recommends: \u201cWhether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.3.10) Even if one has material desires, one can undoubtedly achieve what he wants by rendering service to the Lord."

The Lord manifests Himself in three features \u2014 as Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Mahe\u015bvara \u2014 to control these three qualities.

Ultimately, however, He is the controller of all three gu\u1e47as. Lord Brahm\u0101, expressing his appreciation, said that because Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u had now taken charge of the activities of goodness, there was every hope that the demigods would be successful in fulfilling their desires. The demigods were harassed by the demons, who were infested with tamo-gu\u1e47a. However, as Lord Brahm\u0101 has previously described, since the time of sattva-gu\u1e47a had now arrived, the demigods could naturally expect to fulfill their desires. The demigods are supposedly well advanced in knowledge, yet they could not understand the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord is addressed here as anant\u0101ya. Although Lord Brahm\u0101 knows past, present and future, he is unable to understand the unlimited knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
