There were also bilva, kapittha, jamb\u012bra and bhall\u0101taka trees. Intoxicated bumblebees drank honey and hummed with the chirping of the birds, whose songs were very melodious. The lake was crowded with swans, k\u0101ra\u1e47\u1e0davas, cakr\u0101vakas, cranes, and flocks of water chickens, d\u0101ty\u016bhas, koya\u1e63\u1e6dis and other murmuring birds. Because of the agitating movements of the fish and tortoises, the water was decorated with pollen that had fallen from the lotus flowers. The lake was surrounded by kadamba flowers, vetasa flowers, nalas, n\u012bpas, va\u00f1julakas, kundas, kurubakas, a\u015bokas, \u015bir\u012b\u1e63as, k\u016b\u1e6dajas, i\u1e45gudas, kubjakas, svar\u1e47a-y\u016bth\u012bs, n\u0101gas, punn\u0101gas, j\u0101t\u012bs, mallik\u0101s, \u015batapatras, j\u0101lak\u0101s and m\u0101dhav\u012b-lat\u0101s. The banks were also abundantly adorned with varieties of trees that yielded flowers and fruits in all seasons. Thus the entire mountain stood gloriously decorated.",
        "purport": " Judging from the exhaustive description of the lakes and rivers on Trik\u016b\u1e6da Mountain, on earth there is no comparison to their superexcellence. On other planets, however, there are many such wonders. For instance, we understand that there are two million different types of trees, and not all of them are exhibited on earth. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam presents the total knowledge of the affairs of the universe. It not only describes this universe, but also takes into account the spiritual world beyond the universe. No one can challenge the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam\u2019s descriptions of the material and spiritual worlds. The attempts to go from the earth to the moon have failed, but the people of earth can understand what exists on other planets. There is no need of imagination; one may take actual knowledge from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and be satisfied."

        "translation": "Thereafter, because of being pulled into the water and fighting for many long years, the elephant became diminished in his mental, physical and sensual strength. The crocodile, on the contrary, being an animal of the water, increased in enthusiasm, physical strength and sensual power.",
        "purport": " In the fighting between the elephant and the crocodile, the difference was that although the elephant was extremely powerful, he was in a foreign place, in the water. During one thousand years of fighting, he could not get any food, and under the circumstances his bodily strength diminished, and because his bodily strength diminished, his mind also became weak and his senses less powerful. The crocodile, however, being an animal of the water, had no difficulties. He was getting food and was therefore getting mental strength and sensual encouragement. Thus while the elephant became reduced in strength, the crocodile became more and more powerful. Now, from this we may take the lesson that in our fight with m\u0101y\u0101 we should not be in a position in which our strength, enthusiasm and senses will be unable to fight vigorously. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has actually declared war against the illusory energy, in which all the living entities are rotting in a false understanding of civilization. The soldiers in this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement must always possess physical strength, enthusiasm and sensual power. To keep themselves fit, they must therefore place themselves in a normal condition of life. What constitutes a normal condition will not be the same for everyone, and therefore there are divisions of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, \u015b\u016bdra, brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is advised that no one take sanny\u0101sa. From this we can understand that in this age the sanny\u0101sa-\u0101\u015brama is forbidden because people are not strong. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu showed us an example in taking sanny\u0101sa at the age of twenty-four years, but even S\u0101rvabhauma Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101c\u0101rya advised \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu to be extremely careful because He had taken sanny\u0101sa at an early age. For preaching we give young boys sanny\u0101sa, but actually it is being experienced that they are not fit for sanny\u0101sa. There is no harm, however, if one thinks that he is unfit for sanny\u0101sa; if he is very much agitated sexually, he should go to the \u0101\u015brama where sex is allowed, namely the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. That one has been found to be very weak in one place does not mean that he should stop fighting the crocodile of m\u0101y\u0101. One should take shelter of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as we shall see Gajendra do, and at the same time one can be a g\u1e5bhastha if he is satisfied with sexual indulgence. There is no need to give up the fight. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore recommended, sth\u0101ne sthit\u0101\u1e25 \u015bruti-gat\u0101\u1e41 tanu-v\u0101n-manobhi\u1e25. One may stay in whichever \u0101\u015brama is suitable for him; it is not essential that one take sanny\u0101sa. If one is sexually agitated, he can enter the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. But one must continue fighting. For one who is not in a transcendental position, to take sanny\u0101sa artificially is not a very great credit. If sanny\u0101sa is not suitable, one may enter the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama and fight m\u0101y\u0101 with great strength. But one should not give up the fighting and go away."

Everyone tries to save himself from danger, but when one is unable to save himself, if he is pious, he then takes shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.16): Four kinds of pious men \u2014 namely, one who is in danger, one who is in need of money, one who is searching for knowledge and one who is inquisitive \u2014 begin to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order to be saved or to advance. The King of the elephants, in his condition of danger, decided to seek shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. After considerable thought, he intelligently arrived at this correct decision. Such a decision is not reached by a sinful man. Therefore in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that those who are pious (suk\u1e5bt\u012b) can decide that in a dangerous or awkward condition one should seek shelter of the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "purport": " This material world is described as pada\u1e41 pada\u1e41 yad vipad\u0101m, which means that at every step there is danger. A fool wrongly thinks that he is happy in this material world, but in fact he is not, for one who thinks that way is only illusioned. At every step, at every moment, there is danger. In modern civilization one thinks that if he has a nice home and a nice car his life is perfect. In the Western countries, especially in America, it is very nice to possess a good car, but as soon as one is on the road, there is danger because at any moment an accident may take place and one will be killed. The record actually shows that so many people die in such accidents. Therefore if we actually think that this material world is a very happy place, this is our ignorance. Real knowledge is that this material world is full of danger. We may struggle for existence as far as our intelligence allows and may try to take care of ourselves, but unless the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, ultimately saves us from danger, our attempts will be useless. Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja says: We may invent so many ways to be happy or to counteract the dangers of this material world, but unless our attempts are sanctioned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they will never make us happy. Those who try to be happy without taking shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are m\u016b\u1e0dhas, rascals. Na m\u0101\u1e41 du\u1e63k\u1e5btino m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante nar\u0101dham\u0101\u1e25. Those who are the lowest of men refuse to take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because they think that they will be able to protect themselves without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s care. This is their mistake. The decision of the King of the elephants, Gajendra, was correct. In such a dangerous position, he sought shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly not known to everyone, but He is very powerful and influential. Therefore, although the serpent of eternal time, which is fearful in force, endlessly chases everyone, ready to swallow him, if one who fears this serpent seeks shelter of the Lord, the Lord gives him protection, for even death runs away in fear of the Lord. I therefore surrender unto Him, the great and powerful supreme authority who is the actual shelter of everyone.",
        "purport": " One who is intelligent understands that there is a great and supreme authority above everything. That great authority appears in different incarnations to save the innocent from disturbances. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m: the Lord appears in His various incarnations for two purposes \u2014 to annihilate the du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b, the sinful, and to protect His devotees. The King of the elephants decided to surrender unto Him. This is intelligent. One must know that great Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him. The Lord comes personally to instruct us how to be happy, and only fools and rascals do not see by intelligence this supreme authority, the Supreme Person. In the \u015bruti-mantra it is said: It is out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the wind is blowing, that the sun is distributing heat and light, and that death is chasing everyone. Thus there is a supreme controller, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10): may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sacar\u0101caram. This material manifestation is working so well because of the supreme controller. Any intelligent person, therefore, can understand that there is a supreme controller. Furthermore, the supreme controller Himself appears as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and as Lord R\u0101macandra to give us instructions and to show us by example how to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet those who are du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b, the lowest of men, do not surrender (na m\u0101\u1e41 du\u1e63k\u1e5btino m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante nar\u0101dham\u0101\u1e25). In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord clearly says, m\u1e5btyu\u1e25 sarva-hara\u015b c\u0101ham: \u201cI am all-devouring death.\u201d Thus m\u1e5btyu, or death, is the representative who takes everything away from the living entity who has accepted a material body. No one can say, \u201cI do not fear death.\u201d This is a false proposition. Everyone fears death. However, one who seeks shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be saved from death. One may argue, \u201cDoes the devotee not die?\u201d The answer is that a devotee certainly must give up his body, for the body is material. The difference is, however, that for one who surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fully and who is protected by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the present body is his last; he will not again receive a material body to be subjected to death. This is assured in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9). Tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so \u2019rjuna: a devotee, after giving up his body, does not accept a material body, but returns home, back to Godhead. We are always in danger because at any moment death can take place. It is not that only Gajendra, the King of the elephants, was afraid of death. Everyone should fear death because everyone is caught by the crocodile of eternal time and may die at any moment. The best course, therefore, is to seek shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and be saved from the struggle for existence in this material world, in which one repeatedly takes birth and dies. To reach this understanding is the ultimate goal of life."
