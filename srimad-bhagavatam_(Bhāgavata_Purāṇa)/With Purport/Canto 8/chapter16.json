        "purport": " In this verse, Aditi has been addressed by her husband, Ka\u015byapa Muni, as g\u1e5bha-medhini, which means \u201cone who is satisfied in household life for sense gratification.\u201d Generally, those who are in household life pursue sense gratification in the field of activities performed for material results. Such g\u1e5bhamedh\u012bs have only one aim in life \u2014 sense gratification. Therefore it is said, yan maithun\u0101di-g\u1e5bhamedhi-sukha\u1e41 hi tuccham: the householder\u2019s life is based on sense gratification, and therefore the happiness derived from it is very meager. Nonetheless, the Vedic process is so comprehensive that even in householder life one can adjust his activities according to the regulative principles of dharma, artha, k\u0101ma and mok\u1e63a. One\u2019s aim should be to achieve liberation, but because one cannot at once give up sense gratification, in the \u015b\u0101stras there are injunctions prescribing how to follow the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification. As explained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.9), dharmasya hy \u0101pavargyasya n\u0101rtho\u00a0\u2019rth\u0101yopakalpate: \u201cAll occupational engagements are certainly meant for ultimate liberation. They should never be performed for material gain.\u201d Those who are in household life should not think that religion is meant to improve the process of the householder\u2019s sense gratification. Household life is also meant for advancement in spiritual understanding, by which one can ultimately gain liberation from the material clutches. One should remain in household life with the aim of understanding the ultimate goal of life (tattva jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101). Then household life is as good as the life of a yogi. Ka\u015byapa Muni therefore inquired from his wife whether the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification were being properly followed in terms of the \u015b\u0101stric injunctions. As soon as one deviates from the injunctions of the \u015b\u0101stra, the purpose of household life is immediately lost in confusion."

Indeed, the spirit soul is completely different from the material elements from which the body is made. But because of bodily attachment, one is regarded as a husband or son. These illusory relationships are caused by misunderstanding.",
        "purport": " The spirit soul (\u0101tm\u0101 or j\u012bva) is certainly different from the body, which is a combination of five material elements. This is a simple fact, but it is not understood unless one is spiritually educated. Ka\u015byapa Muni met his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, but the same misconception extends throughout the entire universe and is also here on earth. There are different grades of living entities, but all of them are more or less under the impression of the bodily conception of life. In other words, all living entities in this material world are more or less devoid of spiritual education. The Vedic civilization, however, is based on spiritual education, and spiritual education is the special basis on which Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was spoken to Arjuna. In the beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructed Arjuna to understand that the spirit soul is different from the body. \u201cAs the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d (Bg. 2.13) Unfortunately, this spiritual education is completely absent from modern human civilization. No one understands his real self-interest, which lies with the spirit soul, not with the material body. Education means spiritual education. To work hard in the bodily conception of life, without spiritual education, is to live like an animal. N\u0101ya\u1e41 deho deha-bh\u0101j\u0101\u1e41 n\u1e5b-loke ka\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101n k\u0101m\u0101n arhate vid-bhuj\u0101\u1e41 ye (Bh\u0101g. 5.5.1). People are working so hard simply for bodily comforts, without education regarding the spirit soul. Thus they are living in a very risky civilization, for it is a fact that the spirit soul has to transmigrate from one body to another (tath\u0101 deh\u0101ntara-pr\u0101pti\u1e25). Without spiritual education, people are kept in dark ignorance and do not know what will happen to them after the annihilation of the present body. They are working blindly, and blind leaders are directing them. Andh\u0101 yath\u0101ndhair upan\u012byam\u0101n\u0101s te\u00a0\u2019p\u012b\u015ba-tantry\u0101m uru-d\u0101mni baddh\u0101\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 7.5.31). A foolish person does not know that he is completely under the bondage of material nature and that after death material nature will impose upon him a certain type of body, which he will have to accept. He does not know that although in his present body he may be a very important man, he may next get the body of an animal or tree because of his ignorant activities in the modes of material nature. Therefore the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is trying to give the true light of spiritual existence to all living entities. This movement is not very difficult to understand, and people must take advantage of it, for it will save them from the risky life of irresponsibility."

        "translation": "My dear Aditi, engage in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the master of everything, who can subdue everyone\u2019s enemies, and who sits within everyone\u2019s heart. Only that Supreme Person \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or V\u0101sudeva \u2014 can bestow all auspicious benedictions upon everyone, for He is the spiritual master of the universe.",
        "purport": " With these words, Ka\u015byapa Muni tried to pacify his wife. Aditi made her appeal to her material husband. Of course, that is nice, but actually a material relative cannot do anything good for anyone. If anything good can be done, it is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva. Therefore, Ka\u015byapa Muni advised his wife, Aditi, to begin worshiping Lord V\u0101sudeva, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart. He is the friend of everyone and is known as Jan\u0101rdana because He can kill all enemies. There are three modes of material nature \u2014 goodness, passion and ignorance \u2014 and above material nature, transcendental to material nature, is another existence, which is called \u015buddha-sattva. In the material world, the mode of goodness is considered the best, but because of material contamination, even the mode of goodness is sometimes overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance. But when one transcends the competition between these modes and engages himself in devotional service, he rises above the three modes of material nature. In that transcendental position, one is situated in pure consciousness. Sattva\u1e41 vi\u015buddha\u1e41 vasudeva-\u015babditam (Bh\u0101g. 4.3.23). Above material nature is the position called vasudeva, or freedom from material contamination. Only in that position can one perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva. Thus the vasudeva condition fulfills a spiritual necessity. V\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25. When one realizes V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes most exalted. Param\u0101tm\u0101 (V\u0101sudeva) is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord says: \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and who worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d (Bg. 10.10) \u201cThe Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, O Arjuna.\u201d (Bg. 18.61) \u201cThe sage who knows Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.\u201d (Bg. 5.29) Whenever one is perplexed, let him take shelter of the lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who will give the devotee intelligence to help him surpass all difficulties and return home, back to Godhead. Ka\u015byapa Muni advised his wife to seek shelter at the lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, so that all her problems would be very easily solved. Thus Ka\u015byapa Muni was an ideal spiritual master. He was not so foolish that he would present himself as an exalted personality, as good as God. He was actually a bona fide guru because he advised his wife to seek shelter at the lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva. One who trains his subordinate or disciple to worship V\u0101sudeva is the truly bona fide spiritual master. The word jagad-gurum is very important in this regard. Ka\u015byapa Muni did not falsely declare himself to be jagad-guru, although he actually was jagad-guru because he advocated the cause of V\u0101sudeva. Actually, V\u0101sudeva is jagad-guru, as clearly stated here (v\u0101sudeva\u1e41 jagad-gurum). One who teaches the instructions of V\u0101sudeva, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is as good as v\u0101sudeva\u1e41 jagad-gurum. But when one who does not teach this instruction \u2014 as it is \u2014 declares himself jagad-guru, he simply cheats the public. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is jagad-guru, and one who teaches the instruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as it is, on behalf of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, may be accepted as jagad-guru. One who manufactures his own theories cannot be accepted; he becomes jagad-guru falsely."

        "purport": " There are three kinds of men, who are called ak\u0101ma, mok\u1e63a-k\u0101ma and sarva-k\u0101ma. One who tries to get liberation from this material world is called mok\u1e63a-k\u0101ma, one who wants to enjoy this material world to its fullest extent is called sarva-k\u0101ma, and one who has fulfilled all his desires and has no further material desires is called ak\u0101ma. A bhakta has no desire. Sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41 tat-paratvena nirmalam. He is purified and free from material desires. The mok\u1e63a-k\u0101m\u012b wants to achieve liberation by merging into the existence of the Supreme Brahman, and because of this desire to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is not yet pure. And since those who want liberation are impure, what to speak of the karm\u012bs, who have so many desires to fulfill? Nonetheless, the \u015b\u0101stra says: \u201cWhether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.3.10) Ka\u015byapa Muni saw that his wife, Aditi, had some material desires for the welfare of her sons, but still he advised her to render devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, everyone, regardless of whether he is a karm\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, yog\u012b or bhakta, should invariably take shelter of the lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva and render transcendental loving service unto Him so that all his desires will be duly fulfilled. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is d\u012bna-anukampana: He is very merciful to everyone. Therefore if one wants to fulfill his material desires, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a helps him. Of course, sometimes if a devotee is very sincere, the Lord, as a special favor to him, refuses to fulfill his material desires and directly blesses him with pure, unalloyed devotional service. It is said in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.38-39): \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says,\u00a0\u2018If one engages in My transcendental loving service but at the same time wants the opulence of material enjoyment, he is very, very foolish. Indeed, he is just like a person who gives up ambrosia to drink poison. Since I am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take the nectar of the shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget illusory material enjoyment.\u2019\u201d If a devotee maintains some material desire and at the same time very sincerely desires to engage at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may directly give him unalloyed devotional service and take away all his material desires and possessions. This is the Lord\u2019s special favor to devotees. Otherwise, if one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotional service but still has material desires to fulfill, he may become free from all material desires, as Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did, but this may take some time. However, if a very sincere devotee wants only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly gives him the position of \u015buddha-bhakti, unalloyed devotional service."

This is the bona fide Vedic system of receiving the process of devotional service, by which the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased. Therefore, to approach a bona fide guru, or spiritual master, is essential. The bona fide spiritual master is he who has received the mercy of his guru, who in turn is bona fide because he has received the mercy of his guru. This is called the parampar\u0101 system. Unless one follows this parampar\u0101 system, the mantra one receives will be chanted for no purpose. Nowadays there are so many rascal gurus who manufacture their mantras as a process for material advancement, not spiritual advancement. Still, the mantra cannot be successful if it is manufactured. Mantras and the process of devotional service have special power, provided they are received from the authorized person."

One should also offer a flame, incense and so on, while ringing a bell, as prescribed. This is called worship of the Lord. Here it is recommended that one observe the vow of subsisting only by drinking milk. This is called payo-vrata. As we generally perform devotional service on Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b by not eating grains, it is generally recommended that on Dv\u0101da\u015b\u012b one not consume anything but milk. Payo-vrata and arcana devotional service to the Supreme Lord should be performed with a pure devotional attitude (bhakty\u0101). Without bhakti, one cannot worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Worshiping Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the supreme process of worship. And how Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped in this payo-vrata ceremony has now been fully described. The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u by var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. The Vedic principles of four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas are meant for worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (vi\u1e63\u1e47ur \u0101r\u0101dhyate panth\u0101 n\u0101nyat tat-to\u1e63a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am). The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is also vi\u1e63\u1e47u-\u0101r\u0101dhanam, or worship of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, according to the age. The payo-vrata method of vi\u1e63\u1e47u-\u0101r\u0101dhanam was enunciated long, long ago by Ka\u015byapa Muni to his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, and the same process is bona fide on earth even now. Especially for this Age of Kali, the process accepted by the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is to open hundreds and thousands of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u temples (temples of R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Jagann\u0101tha, Balar\u0101ma, S\u012bt\u0101-R\u0101ma, Gaura-Nit\u0101i and so on). Performing prescribed worship in such temples of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and thus worshiping the Lord is as good as performing the payo-vrata ceremony recommended here. The payo-vrata ceremony is performed from the first to the thirteenth day of the bright fortnight of the moon, but in our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped in every temple according to a schedule of twenty-four hours of engagement in performing k\u012brtana, chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, offering palatable food to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and distributing this food to Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and others. These are authorized activities, and if the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement stick to these principles, they will achieve the same result one gains by observing the payo-vrata ceremony. Thus the essence of all auspicious activities, such as performing yaj\u00f1a, giving in charity, observing vratas, and undergoing austerities, is included in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. The members of this movement should immediately and sincerely follow the processes already recommended. Of course, sacrifice is meant to please Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25: in Kali-yuga, those who are intelligent perform the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. One should follow this process conscientiously."
