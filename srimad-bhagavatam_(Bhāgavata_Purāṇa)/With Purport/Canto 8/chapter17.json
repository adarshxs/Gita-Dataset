Please be kind to us and spread our good fortune.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of those who observe vows and austerities, and it is He who bestows benedictions upon them. He is worshipable for the devotee throughout the devotee\u2019s life, for He never breaks His promises. As He says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.31), kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.\u201d The Lord is addressed here as acyuta, the infallible, because He takes care of His devotees. Anyone inimical to the devotees is certainly vanquished by the mercy of the Lord. The Lord is the source of the Ganges water, and therefore He is addressed here as t\u012brtha-p\u0101da, indicating that all the holy places are at His lotus feet, or that whatever He touches with His foot becomes a holy place. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, for example, begins with the words dharma-k\u1e63etre kuru-k\u1e63etre. Because the Lord was present on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, it became a dharma-k\u1e63etra, a place of pilgrimage. Therefore the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were extremely religious, were assured of victory. Any place where the Supreme Personality of Godhead displays His pastimes, such as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or Dv\u0101rak\u0101, becomes a holy place. The chanting of the holy name of the Lord \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 is pleasing to the ear, and it expands good fortune to the audience who hears it chanted. Owing to the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Aditi was fully assured that the troublesome condition created for her by the demons would now be ended."

        "purport": " A forest fire begins when two pieces of wood rub against one another, being agitated by the wind. Actually, however, fire belongs neither to the wood nor to the wind; it is always different from both. Similarly, here it is to be understood that the union of Ka\u015byapa Muni and Aditi was not like the sexual intercourse of ordinary human beings. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has nothing to do with the human secretions of sexual intercourse. He is always completely aloof from such material combinations. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.29), samo\u00a0\u2019ha\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u: \u201cI am equal toward all living entities.\u201d Nonetheless, to protect the devotees and kill the demons, who were a disturbing element, the Lord entered the womb of Aditi. Therefore this is a transcendental pastime of the Lord. This should not be misunderstood. One should not think that the Lord became the son of Aditi the way an ordinary child is born because of sexual intercourse between man and woman. Here it may also be appropriate to explain, in these days of controversy, the origin of life. The life force of the living entity \u2014 the soul \u2014 is different from the ovum and semen of the human being. Although the conditioned soul has nothing to do with the reproductive cells of man and woman, he is placed into the proper situation because of his work (karma\u1e47\u0101 daiva-netre\u1e47a). Life is not, however, a product of two secretions, but is independent of all material elements. As fully described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the living entity is not subject to any material reactions. He can neither be burnt by fire, cut by sharp weapons, moistened by water, nor dried by the air. He is completely different from the physical elements, but by a superior arrangement he is put into these material elements. He is always aloof from material contact (asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25) but because he is placed in a material condition, he suffers the reactions of the material modes of nature. \u201cThe living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species.\u201d (Bg. 13.22) Although the living entity is aloof from the material elements, he is put into material conditions, and thus he must suffer the reactions of material activities."
