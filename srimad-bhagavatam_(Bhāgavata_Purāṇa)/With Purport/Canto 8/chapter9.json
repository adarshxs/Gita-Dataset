Women, especially beautiful young women, invoke the dormant lusty desires of a man. Therefore, according to Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, every woman should be protected, either by her husband, by her father or by her grown sons. Without such protection, a woman will be exploited. Indeed, women like to be exploited by men. As soon as a woman is exploited by a man, she becomes a common prostitute. This is explained by Mohin\u012b-m\u016brti, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Because the demigods are always under the shelter of the dust of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, they could very easily drink the nectar and get its result. The demons, however, not having sought shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, were unable to achieve the result they desired.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.11) it is said, ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme judge who rewards or punishes different persons according to their surrender unto His lotus feet. Therefore it can actually be seen that although karm\u012bs and bhaktas may work in the same place, at the same time, with the same energy and with the same ambition, they achieve different results. The karm\u012bs transmigrate through different bodies in the cycle of birth and death, sometimes going upward and sometimes downward, thus suffering the results of their actions in the karma-cakra, the cycle of birth and death. The devotees, however, because of fully surrendering at the lotus feet of the Lord, are never baffled in their attempts. Although externally they work almost like the karm\u012bs, the devotees go back home, back to Godhead, and achieve success in every effort. The demons or atheists have faith in their own endeavors, but although they work very hard day and night, they cannot get any more than their destiny. The devotees, however, can surpass the reactions of karma and achieve wonderful results, even without effort. It is also said, phalena paric\u012byate: one\u2019s success or defeat in any activity is understood by its result. There are many karm\u012bs in the dress of devotees, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead can detect their purpose. The karm\u012bs want to use the property of the Lord for their selfish sense gratification, but a devotee endeavors to use the Lord\u2019s property for God\u2019s service. Therefore a devotee is always distinct from the karm\u012bs, although the karm\u012bs may dress like devotees. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.9), yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25. One who works for Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is free from this material world, and after giving up his body he goes back home, back to Godhead. A karm\u012b, however, although externally working like a devotee, is entangled in his nondevotional activity, and thus he suffers the tribulations of material existence. Thus from the results achieved by the karm\u012bs and devotees, one can understand the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who acts differently for the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs than for the devotees. The author of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta therefore says: The karm\u012bs who desire sense gratification, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who aspire for the liberation of merging into the existence of the Supreme, and the yog\u012bs who seek material success in mystic power are all restless, and ultimately they are baffled. But the devotee, who does not expect any personal benefit and whose only ambition is to spread the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is blessed with all the auspicious results of bhakti-yoga, without hard labor."

        "purport": " This is the distinction between materialistic activities and activities performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The entire world is active, and this includes the karm\u012bs, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, the yog\u012bs and the bhaktas. However, all activities except those of the bhaktas, the devotees, end in bafflement and a waste of time and energy. Mogh\u0101\u015b\u0101 mogha-karm\u0101\u1e47o mogha-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101 vicetasa\u1e25: if one is not a devotee, his hopes, his activities and his knowledge are all baffled. A nondevotee works for his personal sense gratification or for the sense gratification of his family, society, community or nation, but because all such activities are separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are considered asat. The word asat means bad or temporary, and sat means permanent and good. Activities performed for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are permanent and good, but asat activity, although sometimes celebrated as philanthropy, altruism, nationalism, this \u201cism\u201d or that \u201cism,\u201d will never produce any permanent result and is therefore all bad. Even a little work done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a permanent asset and is all-good because it is done for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the all-good Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is everyone\u2019s friend (suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m). The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only enjoyer and proprietor of everything (bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram). Therefore any activity performed for the Supreme Lord is permanent. As a result of such activities, the performer is immediately recognized. Na ca tasm\u0101n manu\u1e63ye\u1e63u ka\u015bcin me priya-k\u1e5bttama\u1e25. Such a devotee, because of full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is immediately transcendental, although he may superficially appear to be engaged in materialistic activities. The only distinction between materialistic activity and spiritual activity is that material activity is performed only to satisfy one\u2019s own senses whereas spiritual activity is meant to satisfy the transcendental senses of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By spiritual activity everyone factually benefits, whereas by materialistic activity no one benefits and instead one becomes entangled in the laws of karma."
