Yamar\u0101ja is the officer appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to judge religious and irreligious principles and to punish people who are irreligious. However, if completely sinless people are punished, the entire assembly of Yamar\u0101ja is contaminated. This principle applies not only in the assembly of Yamar\u0101ja, but throughout human society also. In human society, properly maintaining religious principles is the duty of the king\u2019s court or the government. Unfortunately, in this yuga, Kali-yuga, the religious principles are tampered with, and the government cannot properly judge who is to be punished and who is not. It is said that in the Kali-yuga if one cannot spend money in court, one cannot get justice. Indeed, in courts of justice it is often found that magistrates are bribed for favorable judgments. Sometimes religious men who preach the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement for the benefit of the entire populace are arrested and harassed by the police and courts. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas, who are Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, lamented for these very regrettable facts. Because of their spiritual compassion for all the fallen souls, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas go out to preach according to the standard method of all religious principles, but unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas who have dedicated their lives to preaching the glories of the Lord are sometimes harassed and punished by courts on false charges of disturbing the peace."

        "translation": "A king or governmental official should be so well qualified that he acts as a father, maintainer and protector of the citizens because of affection and love. He should give the citizens good advice and instructions according to the standard scriptures and should be equal to everyone. Yamar\u0101ja does this, for he is the supreme master of justice, and so do those who follow in his footsteps. However, if such persons become polluted and exhibit partiality by punishing an innocent, blameless person, where will the citizens go to take shelter for their maintenance and security?",
        "purport": " The king, or in modern times the government, should act as the guardian of the citizens by teaching them the proper goal of life. The human form of life is especially meant for realization of one\u2019s self and one\u2019s relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead because this cannot be realized in animal life. The duty of the government, therefore, is to take charge of training all the citizens in such a way that by a gradual process they will be elevated to the spiritual platform and will realize the self and his relationship with God. This principle was followed by kings like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, Lord R\u0101macandra, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a and Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. The leaders of the government must be very honest and religious because otherwise all the affairs of the state will suffer. Unfortunately, in the name of democracy, rogues and thieves are electing other rogues and thieves to the most important posts in the government. Recently this has been proven in America, where the president had to be condemned and dragged down from his post by the citizens. This is only one case, but there are many others. Because of the importance of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, people should be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and should not vote for anyone who is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Then there will be actual peace and prosperity in the state. When a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sees mismanagement in the government, he feels great compassion in his heart and tries his best to purify the situation by spreading the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement."

The innocent, unenlightened citizen is like an ignorant animal sleeping in peace with its head on the lap of its master, faithfully believing in the master\u2019s protection. If a leader is actually kindhearted and deserves to be the object of a living entity\u2019s faith, how can he punish or kill a foolish person who has fully surrendered in good faith and friendship?",
        "purport": " The Sanskrit word vi\u015bvasta-gh\u0101ta refers to one who breaks faith or causes a breach of trust. The mass of people should always feel security because of the government\u2019s protection. Therefore, how regrettable it is for the government itself to cause a breach of trust and put the citizens in difficulty for political reasons. We actually saw during the partition days in India that although Hindus and Muslims were living together peacefully, manipulation by politicians suddenly aroused feelings of hatred between them, and thus the Hindus and Muslims killed one another over politics. This is a sign of Kali-yuga. In this age, animals are kept nicely sheltered, completely confident that their masters will protect them, but unfortunately as soon as the animals are fat, they are immediately sent for slaughter. Such cruelty is condemned by Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas like the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas. Indeed, the hellish conditions already described await the sinful men responsible for such suffering. One who betrays the confidence of a living entity who takes shelter of him in good faith, whether that living entity be a human being or an animal, is extremely sinful. Because such betrayals now go unpunished by the government, all of human society is terribly contaminated. The people of this age are therefore described as mand\u0101\u1e25 sumanda-matayo manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101 hy upadrut\u0101\u1e25. As a consequence of such sinfulness, men are condemned (mand\u0101\u1e25), their intelligence is unclear (sumanda-mataya\u1e25), they are unfortunate (manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101\u1e25), and therefore they are always disturbed by many problems (upadrut\u0101\u1e25). This is their situation in this life, and after death they are punished in hellish conditions."

There are twenty types of religious scriptures called dharma-\u015b\u0101stras, beginning with the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and Par\u0101\u015bara-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, but herein it is stressed that although one may become free from the reactions of the most sinful activities by following the religious principles of these scriptures, this cannot promote a sinful man to the stage of loving service to the Lord. On the other hand, chanting the holy name of the Lord even once not only frees one immediately from the reactions of the greatest sins, but also raises one to the platform of rendering loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described as uttama\u015bloka because He is famous for His glorious activities. Thus one serves the Lord by remembering His form, His attributes and pastimes. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura explains that this is all possible simply by chanting the Lord\u2019s holy name because of the Lord\u2019s omnipotence. What cannot be achieved through the performance of Vedic rituals can be easily achieved through the chanting of the Lord\u2019s holy name. To chant the holy name and dance in ecstasy is so easy and sublime that one can achieve all the benefits of spiritual life simply by following this process. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu declares, para\u1e41 vijayate \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtanam: \u201cAll glories to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sa\u1e45k\u012brtana!\u201d The sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement we have started offers the best process for becoming purified of all sinful reactions and coming immediately to the platform of spiritual life."

        "translation": "The ritualistic ceremonies of atonement recommended in the religious scriptures are insufficient to cleanse the heart absolutely because after atonement one\u2019s mind again runs toward material activities. Consequently, for one who wants liberation from the fruitive reactions of material activities, the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, or glorification of the name, fame and pastimes of the Lord, is recommended as the most perfect process of atonement because such chanting eradicates the dirt from one\u2019s heart completely.",
        "purport": " The statements in this verse have been confirmed previously in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.17): \u201c\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Param\u0101tm\u0101 [Supersoul] in everyone\u2019s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.\u201d It is the special mercy of the Supreme Lord that as soon as He knows that one is glorifying His name, fame and attributes, He personally helps cleanse the dirt from one\u2019s heart. Therefore simply by such glorification one not only becomes purified, but also achieves the results of pious activities (pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana). Pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana refers to the process of devotional service. Even if one does not understand the meaning of the Lord\u2019s name, pastimes or attributes, one is purified simply by hearing or chanting of them. Such purification is called sattva-bh\u0101vana. One\u2019s main purpose in human life should be to purify his existence and achieve liberation. As long as one has a material body, one is understood to be impure. In such an impure, material condition, one cannot enjoy a truly blissful life, although everyone seeks it. Therefore \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.1) says, tapo divya\u1e41 putrak\u0101 yena sattva\u1e41 \u015buddhyet: one must perform tapasya, austerity, to purify his existence in order to come to the spiritual platform. The tapasya of chanting and glorifying the name, fame and attributes of the Lord is a very easy purifying process by which everyone can be happy. Therefore everyone who desires the ultimate cleansing of his heart must adopt this process. Other processes, such as karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga, cannot cleanse the heart absolutely."

All desires within this material world are sinful because material desire means sense gratification, which always involves action that is more or less sinful. Pure bhakti, however, is any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya; in other words, it is free from material desires, which result from karma and j\u00f1\u0101na. One who is situated in devotional service no longer has material desires, and therefore he is beyond sinful life. Material desires should be completely stopped. Otherwise, although one\u2019s austerities, penances and charity may free one from sin for the time being, one\u2019s desires will reappear because his heart is impure. Thus he will act sinfully and suffer."

Even a few years ago, such hippies did not know the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, but now they are chanting it and becoming pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Thus they are becoming free from all sinful activities, such as illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. This is practical proof of the effectiveness of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement, which is supported in this verse. One may or may not know the value of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, but if one somehow or other chants it, he will immediately be purified, just as one who takes a potent medicine will feel its effects, regardless of whether he takes it knowingly or unknowingly."

Because Aj\u0101mila was now free from all sinful reactions, his lifetime was extended, even though he was to have died immediately. When the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas saw Aj\u0101mila trying to say something to them, they disappeared to give him a chance to glorify the Supreme Lord. Since all his sinful reactions had been vanquished, he was now prepared to glorify the Lord. Indeed, one cannot glorify the Lord unless one is completely free from all sinful activities. This is confirmed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.28): \u201cPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination.\u201d The Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas made Aj\u0101mila aware of devotional service so that He might immediately become fit to return home, back to Godhead. To increase his eagerness to glorify the Lord, they disappeared so that he would feel separation in their absence. In the mode of separation, glorification of the Lord is very intense."

He could then remember his past sinful activities, which he greatly regretted having performed.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.45) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told Arjuna: \u201cThe Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self.\u201d The Vedic principles certainly prescribe a gradual process for rising to the spiritual platform, but if one remains attached to the Vedic principles, there is no chance of his being elevated to spiritual life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore advised Arjuna to perform devotional service, which is the process of transcendental religion. The transcendental position of devotional service is also confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.6). Sa vai pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41 paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok\u1e63aje. Bhakti, devotional service, is paro dharma\u1e25, transcendental dharma; it is not material dharma. People generally think that religion should be pursued for material profit. This may be suitable for persons interested in material life, but one who is interested in spiritual life should be attached to paro dharma\u1e25, the religious principles by which one becomes a devotee of the Supreme Lord (yato bhaktir adhok\u1e63aje). The bh\u0101gavata religion teaches that the Lord and the living entity are eternally related and that the duty of the living entity is to surrender to the Lord. When one is situated on the platform of devotional service, one is freed from impediments and completely satisfied (ahaituky apratihat\u0101 yay\u0101tm\u0101 supras\u012bdati). Having been elevated to that platform, Aj\u0101mila began to lament for his past materialistic activities and glorify the name, fame, form and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Therefore the custom in Vedic society is to examine the horoscopes of a girl and boy being considered for marriage to see whether their combination is suitable. Vedic astrology reveals whether one has been born in the vipra-var\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya-var\u1e47a, vai\u015bya-var\u1e47a or \u015b\u016bdra-var\u1e47a, according to the three qualities of material nature. This must be examined because a marriage between a boy of the vipra-var\u1e47a and a girl of the \u015b\u016bdra-var\u1e47a is incompatible; married life would be miserable for both husband and wife. Consequently a boy should marry a girl of the same category. Of course, this is trai-gu\u1e47ya, a material calculation according to the Vedas, but if the boy and girl are devotees there need be no such considerations. A devotee is transcendental, and therefore in a marriage between devotees, the boy and girl form a very happy combination."

Certainly this was due to good counsel given from within by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6do matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca: \u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\u201d The Lord, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, is so kind that if one has ever rendered service to Him, the Lord never forgets him. Thus the Lord, from within, gave Aj\u0101mila the opportunity to name his youngest son N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a so that in affection he would constantly call \u201cN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a! N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a!\u201d and thus be saved from the most fearful and dangerous condition at the time of his death. Such is the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja: by the mercy of the guru and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one receives the seed of bhakti. This association saves a devotee from the greatest fear. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement we therefore change a devotee\u2019s name to a form that reminds him of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. If at the time of death the devotee can remember his own name, such as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa or Govinda d\u0101sa, he can be saved from the greatest danger. Therefore the change of names at the time of initiation is essential. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is so meticulous that it gives one a good opportunity to remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a somehow or other."

        "purport": " How a living entity becomes a victim of the material condition is lucidly explained in this verse. The beginning is to misidentify the body as one\u2019s self. Therefore Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 begins with the spiritual instruction that one is not the body, but is within the body. This consciousness can be possible only if one chants the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, and always keeps oneself in the association of devotees. This is the secret of success. Therefore we stress that one should chant the holy name of the Lord and keep oneself free from the contaminations of this material world, especially the contaminations of lusty desires for illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. With determination, one should vow to follow these principles and thus be saved from the miserable condition of material existence. The first necessity is to become freed from the bodily concept of life."

By seeing the Lord during \u0101rati, by offering bhoga and by constantly thinking of the form of the Deity, one becomes a first-class yog\u012b.

One cannot derive the proper benefit from other methods, such as pious atonement, speculative knowledge and meditation in mystic yoga, because even after following such methods one takes to fruitive activities again, unable to control his mind, which is contaminated by the base qualities of nature, namely passion and ignorance.",
        "purport": " It has actually been seen that even after achieving so-called perfection, many karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs become attached to material activities again. Many so-called sv\u0101m\u012bs and yog\u012bs give up material activities as false (jagan mithy\u0101), but after some time they nevertheless resume material activities by opening hospitals and schools or performing other activities for the benefit of the public. Sometimes they participate in politics, although still falsely declaring themselves sanny\u0101s\u012bs, members of the renounced order. The perfect conclusion, however, is that if one actually desires to get out of the material world, he must take to devotional service, which begins with \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25: chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has actually proved this. In the Western countries, many young boys who were addicted to drugs and who had many other bad habits, which they could not give up, abandoned all those propensities and very seriously engaged in chanting the glories of the Lord as soon as they joined the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. In other words, this process is the perfect method of atonement for actions performed in raja\u1e25 and tama\u1e25 (passion and ignorance). As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.19): As a result of raja\u1e25 and tama\u1e25, one becomes increasingly lusty and greedy, but when one takes to the process of chanting and hearing, one comes to the platform of goodness and becomes happy. As he advances in devotional service, all his doubts are completely eradicated (bhidyate h\u1e5bdaya-granthi\u015b chidyante sarva-sa\u1e41\u015bay\u0101\u1e25). Thus the knot of his desire for fruitive activities is cut to pieces."

        "translation": "While suffering at the time of death, Aj\u0101mila chanted the holy name of the Lord, and although the chanting was directed toward his son, he nevertheless returned home, back to Godhead. Therefore if one faithfully and inoffensively chants the holy name of the Lord, where is the doubt that he will return to Godhead?",
        "purport": " At the time of death one is certainly bewildered because his bodily functions are in disorder. At that time, even one who throughout his life has practiced chanting the holy name of the Lord may not be able to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra very distinctly. Nevertheless, such a person receives all the benefits of chanting the holy name. While the body is fit therefore, why should we not chant the holy name of the Lord loudly and distinctly? If one does so, it is quite possible that even at the time of death he will be properly able to chant the holy name of the Lord with love and faith. In conclusion, one who chants the holy name of the Lord constantly is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura\u2019s commentary to texts 9 and 10 of this chapter form a dialogue concerning how one can become free from all sinful reactions simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Someone may say, \u201cIt may be accepted that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes freed from all the reactions of sinful life. However, if one commits sinful acts in full consciousness, not only once but many, many times, he is unable to free himself from the reactions of such sins even after atoning for them for twelve years or more. How is it possible, then, that simply by once chanting the holy name of the Lord one immediately becomes freed from the reactions of such sins?\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura replies by quoting verses 9 and 10 of this chapter: \u201cThe chanting of the holy name of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the best process of atonement for a thief of gold or other valuables, for a drunkard, for one who betrays a friend or relative, for one who kills a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or for one who indulges in sex with the wife of his guru or another superior. It is also the best method of atonement for one who murders women, the king or his father, for one who slaughters cows, and for all other sinful men. Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, such sinful persons may attract the attention of the Supreme Lord, who therefore considers \u201cBecause this man has chanted My holy name, My duty is to give him protection.\u2019\u201d One may atone for sinful life and vanquish all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name, although this is not called atonement. Ordinary atonement may temporarily protect a sinful person, but it does not completely cleanse his heart of the deep-rooted desire to commit sinful acts. Therefore atonement is not as powerful as the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. In the \u015b\u0101stras it is said that if a person only once chants the holy name and completely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord immediately considers him His ward and is always inclined to give him protection. This is confirmed by \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b. Thus when Aj\u0101mila was in great danger of being carried off by the order carriers of Yamar\u0101ja, the Lord immediately sent His personal order carriers to protect him, and because Aj\u0101mila was freed from all sinful reactions, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas spoke on his behalf. Aj\u0101mila had named his son N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and because he loved the boy very much, he would call him again and again. Although he was calling for his son, the name itself was powerful because the name N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is not different from the Supreme Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. When Aj\u0101mila named his son N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, all the reactions of his sinful life were neutralized, and as he continued calling his son and thus chanting the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a thousands of times, he was actually unconsciously advancing in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One may argue, \u201cSince he was constantly chanting the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, how was it possible for him to be associating with a prostitute and thinking of wine?\u201d By his sinful actions he was bringing suffering upon himself again and again, and therefore one may say that his ultimate chanting of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a was the cause of his being freed. However, his chanting would then have been a n\u0101ma-apar\u0101dha. N\u0101mno bal\u0101d yasya hi p\u0101pa-buddhi\u1e25: one who continues to act sinfully and tries to neutralize his sins by chanting the holy name of the Lord is a n\u0101ma-apar\u0101dh\u012b, an offender to the holy name. In response it may be said that Aj\u0101mila\u2019s chanting was inoffensive because he did not chant the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a with the purpose of counteracting his sins. He did not know that he was addicted to sinful actions, nor did he know that his chanting of the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a was neutralizing them. Thus he did not commit a n\u0101ma-apar\u0101dha, and his repeated chanting of the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a while calling his son may be called pure chanting. Because of this pure chanting, Aj\u0101mila unconsciously accumulated the results of bhakti. Indeed, even his first utterance of the holy name was sufficient to nullify all the sinful reactions of his life. To cite a logical example, a fig tree does not immediately yield fruits, but in time the fruits are available. Similarly, Aj\u0101mila\u2019s devotional service grew little by little, and therefore although he committed very sinful acts, the reactions did not affect him. In the \u015b\u0101stras it is said that if one chants the holy name of the Lord even once, the reactions of past, present or future sinful life do not affect him. To give another example, if one extracts the poison fangs of a serpent, this saves the serpent\u2019s future victims from poisonous effects, even if the serpent bites repeatedly. Similarly, if a devotee chants the holy name even once inoffensively, this protects him eternally. He need only wait for the results of the chanting to mature in due course of time."
