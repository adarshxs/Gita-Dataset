When he killed V\u1e5btr\u0101sura, all the demigods were extremely happy. Why, then, was Indra himself unhappy?",
        "purport": " This, of course, is a very intelligent question. When a demon is killed, certainly all the demigods are happy. In this case, however, when all the demigods were happy because of V\u1e5btr\u0101sura\u2019s having been killed, Indra was unhappy. Why? It may be suggested that Indra was unhappy because he knew that he had killed a great devotee and br\u0101hma\u1e47a. V\u1e5btr\u0101sura outwardly appeared to be a demon, but inwardly he was a great devotee and therefore a great br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Herein it is clearly indicated that a person who is not at all demoniac, such as Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, may outwardly be a demon or be born in a family of demons. Therefore in terms of real culture one should not be considered a demigod or demon simply according to birth. In his dealings while fighting with Indra, V\u1e5btr\u0101sura proved himself a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Furthermore, as soon as he finished fighting with Indra and was apparently killed, V\u1e5btr\u0101sura was transferred to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka to become an associate of Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. Indra knew this, and therefore he was morose at having killed such a demon, who was actually a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava or br\u0101hma\u1e47a. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is already a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although a br\u0101hma\u1e47a may not be a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. The Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a says: One may be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in terms of his culture and family and may be expert in Vedic knowledge (mantra-tantra-vi\u015b\u0101rada\u1e25), but if he is not a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he cannot be a guru. This means that an expert br\u0101hma\u1e47a may not be a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, but a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is already a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. A millionaire may very easily possess hundreds and thousands of dollars, but a person with hundreds and thousands of dollars is not necessarily a millionaire. V\u1e5btr\u0101sura was a perfect Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, and therefore he was also a br\u0101hma\u1e47a."

You will be freed even if you kill the entire universe, including the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, not to speak of killing a disturbing demon like V\u1e5btr\u0101sura.",
        "purport": " It is said in the B\u1e5bhad-vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a: Also, in the Prema-vivarta by Jagad\u0101nanda Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita it is said: This means that by once chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can be freed from the reactions of more sins that he can even imagine performing. The holy name is so spiritually potent that simply by chanting the holy name one can be freed from the reactions to all sinful activities. What, then, is to be said of those who chant the holy name regularly or worship the Deity regularly? For such purified devotees, freedom from sinful reaction is certainly assured. This does not mean, however, that one should intentionally commit sinful acts and think himself free from the reactions because he is chanting the holy name. Such a mentality is a most abominable offense at the lotus feet of the holy name. N\u0101mno bal\u0101d yasya hi p\u0101pa-buddhi\u1e25: the Lord\u2019s holy name certainly has the potency to neutralize all sinful activities, but if one repeatedly and intentionally commits sins while chanting the holy name, he is most condemned. These verses name the performers of various sinful deeds. In the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 the following names are given. A son begotten by a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and born from the womb of a \u015b\u016bdra mother is called a p\u0101ra\u015bava or ni\u1e63\u0101da, a hunter accustomed to stealing. A son begotten by a ni\u1e63\u0101da in the womb of a \u015b\u016bdra woman is called a pukkasa. A child begotten by a k\u1e63atriya in the womb of the daughter of a \u015b\u016bdra is called an ugra. A child begotten by a \u015b\u016bdra in the womb of the daughter of a k\u1e63atriya is called a k\u1e63att\u0101. A child begotten by a k\u1e63atriya in the womb of a lower-class woman is called a \u015bv\u0101da, or dog-eater. All such offspring are considered extremely sinful, but the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so strong that all of them can be purified simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. The Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement offers everyone a chance to be purified, regardless of birth or family. As confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.4.18): \u201cKir\u0101tas, H\u016b\u1e47as, \u0100ndhras, Pulindas, Pulka\u015bas, \u0100bh\u012bras, \u015aumbhas, Yavanas, members of the Khasa races, and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of devotees of the Lord, for He is the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.\u201d Even such sinful persons can certainly all be purified if they chant the holy name of the Lord under the direction of a pure devotee. Herein the sages encourage King Indra to kill V\u1e5btr\u0101sura even at the risk of brahma-haty\u0101, the killing of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and they guarantee to release him from sinful reactions by performing an a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1a. Such purposefully devised atonement, however, cannot relieve the performer of sinful acts. This will be seen from the following verse."
