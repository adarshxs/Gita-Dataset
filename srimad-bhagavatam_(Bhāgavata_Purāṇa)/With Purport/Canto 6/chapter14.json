        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura gives the following purport to this verse. Simply desiring mukti, or liberation, is insufficient; one must become factually liberated. When one understands the futility of the materialistic way of life, one becomes advanced in knowledge, and therefore he situates himself in the v\u0101naprastha order, unattached to family, wife and children. One should then further progress to the platform of sanny\u0101sa, the actual renounced order, never to fall again and be afflicted by materialistic life. Even though one desires to be liberated, this does not mean he is liberated. Only rarely is someone liberated. Indeed, although many men take sanny\u0101sa to become liberated, because of their imperfections they again become attached to women, material activities, social welfare work and so on. J\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, yog\u012bs and karm\u012bs devoid of devotional service are called offenders. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says, m\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e apar\u0101dh\u012b: one who thinks that everything is m\u0101y\u0101 instead of thinking that everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called an apar\u0101dh\u012b, or offender. Although the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, impersonalists, are offenders at the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they may nonetheless be counted among the siddhas, those who have realized the self. They may be considered nearer to spiritual perfection because at least they have realized what spiritual life is. If such a person becomes n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101ya\u1e47a, a devotee of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, he is better than a j\u012bvan-mukta, one who is liberated or perfect. This requires higher intelligence. There are two kinds of j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs. One is inclined to devotional service and the other to impersonal realization. Impersonalists generally undergo great endeavor for no tangible benefit, and therefore it is said that they are husking paddy that has no grain (sth\u016bla-tu\u1e63\u0101vagh\u0101tina\u1e25). The other class of j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, whose j\u00f1\u0101na is mixed with bhakti, are also of two kinds \u2014 those who are devoted to the so-called false form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and those who understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, the actual spiritual form. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b devotees worship N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u with the idea that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has accepted a form of m\u0101y\u0101 and that the ultimate truth is actually impersonal. The pure devotee, however, never thinks that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has accepted a body of m\u0101y\u0101; instead, he knows perfectly well that the original Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person. Such a devotee is actually situated in knowledge. He never merges in the Brahman effulgence. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.2.32): \u201cO Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure. Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet.\u201d Evidence of this same point is also given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11), wherein the Lord says: \u201cFools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.\u201d When rascals (m\u016b\u1e0dhas) see that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a acts exactly like a human being, they deride the transcendental form of the Lord because they do not know the para\u1e41 bh\u0101vam, His transcendental form and activities. Such persons are further described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.12) as follows: \u201cThose who are thus bewildered are attracted by demoniac and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.\u201d Such persons do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is not material. There is no distinction between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body and His soul, but because less intelligent men see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a human being, they deride Him. They cannot imagine how a person like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could be the origin of everything (govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi). Such persons are described as mogh\u0101\u015b\u0101\u1e25, baffled in their hopes. Whatever they desire for the future will be baffled. Even if they apparently engage in devotional service, they are described as mogh\u0101\u015b\u0101\u1e25 because they ultimately desire to merge into the Brahman effulgence. Those who aspire to be elevated to the heavenly planets by devotional service will also be frustrated, because this is not the result of devotional service. However, they are also given a chance to engage in devotional service and be purified. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.17): \u201c\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Param\u0101tm\u0101 [Supersoul] in everyone\u2019s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.\u201d Unless the dirt within the core of one\u2019s heart is cleansed away, one cannot become a pure devotee. Therefore the word su-durlabha\u1e25 (\u201cvery rarely found\u201d) is used in this verse. Not only among hundreds and thousands, but among millions of perfectly liberated souls, a pure devotee is hardly ever found. Therefore the words ko\u1e6di\u1e63v api are used herein. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya gives the following quotations from the Tantra Bh\u0101gavata: \u201cThere are ninety million demigods and seventy million sages, who are all called n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101yana, devotees of Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Among them, only a few are called n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101ya\u1e47a.\u201d The difference between the siddhas and n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101ya\u1e47as is that direct devotees are called n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101ya\u1e47as whereas those who perform various types of mystic yoga are called siddhas."

        "purport": " Here the most significant statement is that the earth completely produced all the necessities of life during the time of King Citraketu. As stated in the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad: \u201cEverything animate or inanimate that is within the universe is controlled and owned by the Lord. One should therefore accept only those things necessary for himself, which are set aside as his quota, and one should not accept other things, knowing well to whom they belong.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme controller, has created the material world, which is completely perfect and free from scarcity. The Lord supplies the necessities of all living entities. These necessities come from the earth, and thus the earth is the source of supply. When there is a good ruler, that source produces the necessities of life abundantly. However, when there is not such a good ruler, there will be scarcity. This is the significance of the word k\u0101madhuk. Elsewhere in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.10.4) it is said, k\u0101ma\u1e41 vavar\u1e63a parjanya\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101ma-dugh\u0101 mah\u012b: \u201cDuring the reign of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of men in profusion.\u201d We have experience that in some seasons the rains produce abundance and in other seasons there is scarcity. We have no control over the earth\u2019s productiveness, for it is naturally under the full control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His order, the Lord can make the earth produce sufficiently or insufficiently. If a pious king rules the earth according to the \u015b\u0101stric injunctions, there will naturally be regular rainfall and sufficient produce to provide for all men. There will be no question of exploitation, for everyone will have enough. Black-marketeering and other corrupt dealings will then automatically stop. Simply ruling the land cannot solve man\u2019s problems unless the leader has spiritual capabilities. He must be like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja or R\u0101macandra. Then all the inhabitants of the land will be extremely happy."

Without these seven elements one cannot exist.

Then come his ministers, his kingdom, his fortifications, his treasury, his system of law and order, and his friends or allies. If these seven are properly maintained, the king is happy. Similarly, as explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (dehino\u00a0\u2019smin yath\u0101 dehe), the living entity, the soul, is within the material covering of the mahat-tattva, ego and pa\u00f1ca-tanm\u0101tr\u0101, the five objects of sense gratification. When these seven are in proper order, the living entity is in a mood of pleasure. Generally when the associates of the king are quiet and obedient, the king can be happy. Therefore the great sage A\u1e45gir\u0101 \u1e5a\u1e63i inquired about the King\u2019s personal health and the good fortune of his seven associates. When we inquire from a friend whether everything is well, we are concerned not only with his personal self but also with his family, his source of income, and his assistants or servants. All of them must be well, and then a person can be happy."

He accepted it to mean that there would certainly be jubilation because of the birth of his future son, but that he would be the King\u2019s only son and, being very proud of his great wealth and empire, would not be very obedient to his father. Thus the King was satisfied, thinking, \u201cLet there be a son. It does not matter if he is not very obedient.\u201d In Bengal there is a proverb that instead of having no maternal uncle, it is better to have a maternal uncle who is blind. The King accepted this philosophy, thinking that a disobedient son would be better than no son at all. The great sage C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita says: \u201cWhat is the use of a son who is neither a learned scholar nor a devotee? Such a son is like a blind, diseased eye, which always causes suffering.\u201d Nevertheless, the material world is so polluted that one wants to have a son even though he is useless.

The subtle laws of karma, which are controlled by the Supreme, cannot be understood by ordinary conditioned souls.
