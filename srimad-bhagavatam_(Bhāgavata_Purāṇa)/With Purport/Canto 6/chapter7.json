Also surrounding him were the Vidy\u0101dharas, Apsar\u0101s, Kinnaras, Patagas [birds] and Uragas [snakes]. All of them were offering Indra their respects and services, and the Apsar\u0101s and Gandharvas were dancing and singing with very sweet musical instruments. Over Indra\u2019s head was a white umbrella as effulgent as the full moon. Fanned by yak-tail whisks and served with all the paraphernalia of a great king, Indra was sitting with his wife, \u015aac\u012bdev\u012b, who occupied half the throne, when the great sage B\u1e5bhaspati appeared in that assembly. B\u1e5bhaspati, the best of the sages, was the spiritual master of Indra and the demigods and was respected by the demigods and demons alike. Nevertheless, although Indra saw his spiritual master before him, he did not rise from his own seat or offer a seat to his spiritual master, nor did Indra offer him a respectful welcome. Indra did nothing to show him respect.",

All I want, life after life, is to be a faithful servant of Your Lordship.\u201d According to the laws of nature, when one is extremely opulent one becomes degraded, and this is true both individually and collectively. The demigods are situated in the mode of goodness, but sometimes even one who is situated in such an exalted position as King Indra, the king of all the demigods, falls down because of material opulence. We are now actually seeing this in America. The entire American nation has tried to advance in material opulence without striving to produce ideal human beings. The result is that Americans are now regretting the wholesale criminality of American society and are wondering how America has become so lawless and unmanageable. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (7.5.31), na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um: persons who are unenlightened do not know the aim of life, which is to return home, back to Godhead. Therefore, both individually and collectively, they try to enjoy so-called material comforts, and they become addicted to wine and women. The men produced in such a society are less than fourth class. They are the unwanted population known as var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara, and as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, an increase of var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara population creates a hellish society. This is the society in which Americans now find themselves. Fortunately, however, the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement has come to America, and many fortunate young men are giving serious attention to this movement, which is creating ideal men of first-class character, men who completely refrain from meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling. If the American people are serious about curbing the degraded criminal life of their nation, they must take to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement and try to create the kind of human society advised in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25). They must divide their society into first-class men, second-class men, third-class men and fourth-class men. Since they are now creating only men who are less than fourth class, how can they avoid the dangers of a criminal society? Long, long ago, Lord Indra regretted his disrespect to his spiritual master, B\u1e5bhaspati. Similarly, it is advised that the American people regret their mistaken advancement in civilization. They should take advice from the spiritual master, the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If they do so, they will be happy, and theirs will be an ideal nation to lead the entire world."

There are many examples of how he should act. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was sitting on His throne and N\u0101rada fortunately entered His assembly, even Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately stood up with His officers and ministers to offer respectful obeisances to N\u0101rada. N\u0101rada knew that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knew that N\u0101rada was His devotee, but although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord and N\u0101rada is the Lord\u2019s devotee, the Lord observed the religious etiquette. Since N\u0101rada was a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and an exalted devotee, even K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, while acting as a king, offered His respectful obeisances unto N\u0101rada. Such is the conduct visible in the Vedic civilization. A civilization in which the people do not know how the representative of N\u0101rada and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be respected, how society should be formed and how one should advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2014 a society concerned only with manufacturing new cars and new skyscrapers every year and then breaking them to pieces and making new ones \u2014 may be technologically advanced, but it is not a human civilization. A human civilization is advanced when its people follow the c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya system, the system of four orders of life. There must be ideal, first-class men to act as advisors, second-class men to act as administrators, third-class men to produce food and protect cows, and fourth-class men who obey the three higher classes of society. One who does not follow the standard system of society should be considered a fifth-class man. A society without Vedic laws and regulations will not be very helpful to humanity. As stated in this verse, dharma\u1e41 te na para\u1e41 vidu\u1e25: such a society does not know the aim of life and the highest principle of religion."

A stone boat would be unable to float and would sink in the water with its passengers. Similarly, those who mislead people go to hell, and their followers go with them.",
        "purport": " As stated in the Vedic literature (Bh\u0101g. 11.20.17): We, the conditioned souls, have fallen in the ocean of nescience, but the human body fortunately provides us a good opportunity to cross the ocean because the human body is like a very good boat. When directed by a spiritual master acting as the captain, the boat can very easily cross the ocean. Furthermore, the boat is helped across by favorable winds, which are the instructions of Vedic knowledge. If one does not take advantage of all these facilities to cross the ocean of nescience, he is certainly committing suicide. One who boards a boat made of stone is doomed. To be elevated to the stage of perfection, humanity must first give up false leaders who present boats of stone. All of human society is in such a dangerous position that to be rescued it must abide by the standard instructions of the Vedas. The cream of these instructions appears in the form of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One should not take shelter of any other instructions, for Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives direct instructions on how to fulfill the aim of human life. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore says, sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: \u201cGive up all other processes of religion and simply surrender to Me.\u201d Even if one does not accept Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His instructions are so exalted and beneficial for humanity that if one follows His instructions one will be saved. Otherwise one will be cheated by unauthorized meditation and gymnastic methods of yoga. Thus one will board a boat of stone, which will sink and drown all its passengers. Unfortunately, although the American people are extremely eager to get out of materialistic chaos, they are sometimes found to patronize the makers of stone boats. That will not help them. They must take the proper boat offered by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the form of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Then they will be easily saved. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments: a\u015bmamaya\u1e25 plavo ye\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 te yath\u0101 majjanta\u1e41 plavam anumajjanti tatheti r\u0101ja-n\u012bty-upade\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5b\u1e63u sva-sabhye\u1e63u kopo vya\u00f1jita\u1e25. If society is guided by political diplomacy, with one nation maneuvering against another, it will certainly sink like a stone boat. Political maneuvering and diplomacy will not save human society. People must take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to understand the aim of life, to understand God, and to fulfill the human mission."

From this example, we should learn this principle enunciated by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura: \u201cBy the mercy of the spiritual master one is benedicted by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without the grace of the spiritual master, one cannot make any advancement.\u201d A disciple should never be a hypocrite or be unfaithful to his spiritual master. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.17.27), the spiritual master is also called \u0101c\u0101rya. \u0100c\u0101rya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 vij\u0101n\u012by\u0101n: the Supreme Personality of Godhead says that one should respect the spiritual master, accepting him as the Lord Himself. N\u0101vamanyeta karhicit: one should not disrespect the \u0101c\u0101rya at any time. Na martya-buddhy\u0101s\u016byeta: one should never think the \u0101c\u0101rya an ordinary person. Familiarity sometimes breeds contempt, but one should be very careful in one\u2019s dealings with the \u0101c\u0101rya. Ag\u0101dha-dhi\u1e63a\u1e47a\u1e41 dvijam: the \u0101c\u0101rya is a perfect br\u0101hma\u1e47a and has unlimited intelligence in guiding the activities of his disciple. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.34): \u201cJust try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201d One should fully surrender unto the spiritual master. and with service (sevay\u0101) one should approach him for further spiritual enlightenment."

Because he is aware of the Supreme Brahman and fully in control of his senses, he is the best of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Therefore it is very astonishing that you have acted impudently toward him.",
        "purport": " Lord Brahm\u0101 recognized the brahminical qualifications of B\u1e5bhaspati, who was the spiritual master of the demigods because of his awareness of the Supreme Brahman. B\u1e5bhaspati was very much in control of his senses and mind, and therefore he was a most qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Lord Brahm\u0101 chastised the demigods for not properly respecting this br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who was their guru. Lord Brahm\u0101 wanted to impress upon the demigods that one\u2019s guru should not be disrespected under any circumstances. When B\u1e5bhaspati entered the assembly of the demigods, they and their king, Indra, took him for granted. Since he came every day, they thought, they did not need to show him special respect. As it is said, familiarity breeds contempt. Being very much displeased, B\u1e5bhaspati immediately left Indra\u2019s palace. Thus all the demigods, headed by Indra, became offenders at the lotus feet of B\u1e5bhaspati, and Lord Brahm\u0101, being aware of this, condemned their neglect. In a song we sing every day, Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says, cak\u1e63u-d\u0101na dila yei, janme janme prabhu sei: the guru gives spiritual insight to the disciple, and therefore the guru should be considered his master, life after life. Under no circumstances should the guru be disrespected, but the demigods, being puffed up by their material possessions, were disrespectful to their guru. Therefore \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.17.27) advises, \u0101c\u0101rya\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 vij\u0101n\u012by\u0101n n\u0101vamanyeta karhicit/ na martya-buddhy\u0101s\u016byeta: the \u0101c\u0101rya should always be offered respectful obeisances; one should never envy the \u0101c\u0101rya, considering him an ordinary human being."

Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa was junior in relationship to the demigods because he was their nephew, but the demigods wanted to accept him as their priest, and therefore he would have to accept obeisances from them. The demigods explained that this should not be a cause for hesitation; he could become their priest because he was advanced in Vedic knowledge. Similarly. C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita advises, n\u012bc\u0101d apy uttama\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam: one may accept education from a member of a lower social order. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the members of the most elevated var\u1e47a, are teachers, but a person in a lower family, such as a family of k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas or even \u015b\u016bdras, may be accepted as a teacher if he has knowledge. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu approved of this when He expressed this opinion before R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya (Cc.

In other words, a pure br\u0101hma\u1e47a voluntarily accepts a life of poverty and lives in complete dependence on the mercy of the Lord. Not very many years ago, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47anagara, near Navadv\u012bpa, was offered some help from the local Zamindar, R\u0101j\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47acandra. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a refused to accept the help.

The conclusion is that although a br\u0101hma\u1e47a may receive much opulence from his disciples, he should not utilize the rewards of his priesthood for his personal benefit; he must use them for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

By this intelligent mantra, he took away the opulence of the demons and gave it to Mahendra, the King of heaven.",
        "purport": " The distinction between the demigods (devas) and demons (asuras) is that the demigods are all devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u whereas the demons are devotees of demigods like Lord \u015aiva, Goddess K\u0101l\u012b and Goddess Durg\u0101. Sometimes the demons are also devotees of Lord Brahm\u0101. For example, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was a devotee of Lord Brahm\u0101, R\u0101va\u1e47a was a devotee of Lord \u015aiva, and Mahi\u1e63\u0101sura was a devotee of Goddess Durg\u0101. The demigods are devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (vi\u1e63\u1e47u-bhakta\u1e25 sm\u1e5bto daiva), whereas the demons (\u0101suras tad-viparyaya\u1e25) are always against the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-bhaktas, or Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. To oppose the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, the demons become devotees of Lord \u015aiva, Lord Brahm\u0101, K\u0101l\u012b, Durg\u0101, and so on. In the days of yore, many long years ago, there was animosity between the devas and the asuras, and the same spirit still continues, for the devotees of Lord \u015aiva and Goddess Durg\u0101 are always envious of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, who are devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This strain between the devotees of Lord \u015aiva and Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has always existed. In the higher planetary systems, fights between the demons and the demigods continue for a long, long time. Herein we see that Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa made for the demigods a protective covering, saturated with a Vi\u1e63\u1e47u mantra. Sometimes the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u mantra is called Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-jvara, and the \u015aiva mantra is called \u015aiva-jvara. We find in the \u015b\u0101stras that sometimes the \u015aiva-jvara and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-jvara are employed in the fights between the demons and the demigods. The word sura-dvi\u1e63\u0101m, which in this verse means \u201cof the enemies of the demigods,\u201d also refers to the atheists. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam elsewhere says that Lord Buddha appeared for the purpose of bewildering the demons or atheists. The Supreme Personality of Godhead always awards His benediction to devotees. The Lord Himself confirms this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.31): \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.\u201d"
