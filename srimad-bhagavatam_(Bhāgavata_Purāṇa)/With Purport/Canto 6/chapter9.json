The hair on the demon\u2019s body and his beard and moustache were the color of melted copper, and his eyes were piercing like the midday sun. He appeared unconquerable, as if holding the three worlds on the points of his blazing trident. Dancing and shouting with a loud voice, he made the entire surface of the earth tremble as if from an earthquake. As he yawned again and again, he seemed to be trying to swallow the whole sky with his mouth, which was as deep as a cave. He seemed to be licking up all the stars in the sky with his tongue and eating the entire universe with his long, sharp teeth. Seeing this gigantic demon, everyone, in great fear, ran here and there in all directions.",

The demigods, being afraid of death, took shelter of the Lord and offered Him these prayers. Although the time factor is fearful to everyone, fear personified is afraid of the Supreme Lord, who is therefore known as abhaya, fearless. Taking shelter of the Supreme Lord brings actual fearlessness, and therefore the demigods decided to take shelter of the Lord."

        "purport": " In this verse, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is ascertained to be the original cause of creation. \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b, in his commentary Bh\u0101v\u0101rtha-d\u012bpik\u0101, replies to the idea that prak\u1e5bti and puru\u1e63a are the causes of the cosmic manifestation. As stated herein, para\u1e41 pradh\u0101na\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 vi\u015bvam anyam: \u201cHe is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. Although different from this universe, He exists in His universal form [vir\u0101\u1e6d r\u016bpa].\u201d The word prak\u1e5bti, which is used to indicate the source of generation, refers to the material energy of the Supreme Lord, and the word puru\u1e63a refers to the living entities, who are the superior energy of the Lord. Both the prak\u1e5bti and puru\u1e63a ultimately enter the Supreme Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (prak\u1e5bti\u1e41 y\u0101nti m\u0101mik\u0101m). Although prak\u1e5bti and puru\u1e63a superficially appear to be the causes of the material manifestation, both are emanations of different energies of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the cause of prak\u1e5bti and puru\u1e63a. He is the original cause (sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am). The N\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a says: Both the prak\u1e5bti and puru\u1e63a, which are inferior and superior energies, are emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (g\u0101m \u0101vi\u015bya), the Lord enters the prak\u1e5bti, and then the prak\u1e5bti creates different manifestations. The prak\u1e5bti is not independent or beyond His energies. V\u0101sudeva, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the original cause of everything. Therefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8): \u201cI am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.\u201d In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.9.33) the Lord also says, aham ev\u0101sam ev\u0101gre: \u201cOnly I existed before the creation.\u201d This is confirmed in the Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a as follows: To generate the universe, the Lord acts indirectly as the puru\u1e63a and directly as the prak\u1e5bti. Because both energies emanate from Lord V\u0101sudeva, the all-pervasive Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is known as both prak\u1e5bti and puru\u1e63a. Therefore V\u0101sudeva is the cause of everything (sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am)."

The demigods are understood to be various limbs of the Supreme Lord\u2019s body, although the Supreme Lord has no material body and does not need anyone\u2019s help. He is spread everywhere (may\u0101 tatam ida\u1e41 sarva\u1e41 jagad avyakta-m\u016brtin\u0101). Nevertheless, He is not present everywhere in His spiritual form. According to the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy, the Supreme Truth, being all-pervasive, does not need a transcendental form. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs suppose that since His form is distributed everywhere, He has no form. This is untrue. The Lord keeps His transcendental form, and at the same time He extends everywhere, in every nook and corner of the material creation."

Does Your Lordship, like an ordinary human being, exist within this material world in a body produced by the material modes? Do You enjoy or suffer the good or bad results of actions under the influence of time, past work and so forth?

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He descends to this material world for two purposes, namely paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m \u2014 to relieve the devotees and kill demons or nondevotees. These two kinds of action are the same for the Absolute Truth. When the Lord comes to punish the demons, He bestows His favor upon them, and similarly when He delivers His devotees and gives them relief, He also bestows His favor. Thus the Lord bestows His favor equally upon the conditioned souls. When a conditioned soul gives relief to others he acts piously, and when he gives trouble to others he acts impiously, but the Lord is neither pious nor impious; He is always full in His spiritual potency, by which He shows equal mercy to the punishable and the protectable. The Lord is ap\u0101pa-viddham; He is never contaminated by the reactions of so-called sinful activities. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present on this earth, He killed many inimical nondevotees, but they all received s\u0101r\u016bpya; in other words, they returned to their original spiritual bodies. One who does not know the Lord\u2019s position says that God is unkind to him but merciful to others. Actually the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.29), samo\u00a0\u2019ha\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u na me dve\u1e63yo\u00a0\u2019sti na priya\u1e25: \u201cI am equal to everyone.

        "translation": "O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all contradictions can be reconciled in You. O Lord, since You are the Supreme Person, the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities, the supreme controller, Your unlimited glories are inconceivable to the conditioned souls. Many modern theologians argue about right and wrong without knowing what is actually right. Their arguments are always false and their judgments inconclusive because they have no authorized evidence with which to gain knowledge of You. Because their minds are agitated by scriptures containing false conclusions, they are unable to understand the truth concerning You. Furthermore, because of polluted eagerness to arrive at the right conclusion, their theories are incapable of revealing You, who are transcendental to their material conceptions. You are one without a second, and therefore in You contradictions like doing and not doing, happiness and distress, are not contradictory. Your potency is so great that it can do and undo anything as You like. With the help of that potency, what is impossible for You? Since there is no duality in Your constitutional position, You can do everything by the influence of Your energy.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being self-sufficient, is full of transcendental bliss (\u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma). He enjoys bliss in two ways \u2014 when He appears happy and when He appears distressed. Distinctions and contradictions are impossible in Him because only from Him have they emanated. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all knowledge, all potency, all strength, opulence and influence. There is no limit to His powers. Since He is full in all transcendental attributes, nothing abominable from the material world can exist in Him. He is transcendental and spiritual, and therefore conceptions of material happiness and distress do not apply to Him. We should not be astonished to find contradictions in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually there are no contradictions. That is the meaning of His being supreme. Because He is all-powerful, He is not subject to the conditioned soul\u2019s arguments regarding His existence or nonexistence. He is pleased to protect His devotees by killing their enemies. He enjoys both the killing and the protecting. Such freedom from duality applies not only to the Lord but also to His devotees. In V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the damsels of Vrajabh\u016bmi enjoy transcendental bliss in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they feel the same transcendental bliss in separation when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Balar\u0101ma leave V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana for Mathur\u0101. There is no question of material pains or pleasures for either the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His pure devotees, although they are sometimes superficially said to be distressed or happy. One who is \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma is blissful in both ways. Nondevotees cannot understand the contradictions present in the Supreme Lord or His devotees. Therefore in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti: the transcendental pastimes can be understood through devotional service; to nondevotees they are inconceivable. Acinty\u0101\u1e25 khalu ye bh\u0101v\u0101 na t\u0101\u1e41s tarke\u1e47a yojayet: the Supreme Lord and His form, name, pastimes and paraphernalia are inconceivable to nondevotees, and one should not try to understand such realities simply by logical arguments. They will not bring one to the right conclusion about the Absolute Truth."

Similarly, devotees who know the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not see contradictions in Him, but nondevotees regard Him as the snakelike source of all fear. For example, when N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva appeared, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja saw the Lord as the supreme solace, whereas his father, a demon, saw Him as the ultimate death.

When one is in knowledge of duality, one knows both fear and bliss. The same Supreme Lord is a source of bliss to devotees and fear to nondevotees who have a poor fund of knowledge. God is one, but people understand the Absolute Truth from different angles of vision. The unintelligent see contradictions in Him, but sober devotees find no contradictions."

Pure devotees are ak\u0101ma, whereas devotees in the upper planetary systems, such as the demigods, are called sak\u0101ma because they still want to enjoy material opulence. Because of their pious activities, the sak\u0101ma devotees are promoted to the higher planetary systems, but at heart they still desire to lord it over the material resources. The sak\u0101ma devotees are sometimes disturbed by the demons and R\u0101k\u1e63asas, but the Lord is so kind that He always saves them by appearing as an incarnation. The Lord\u2019s incarnations are so powerful that Lord V\u0101manadeva covered the entire universe with two steps and therefore had no place for His third step. The Lord is called Trivikrama because He showed His strength by delivering the entire universe with merely three steps. The difference between sak\u0101ma and ak\u0101ma devotees is that when sak\u0101ma devotees, like the demigods, fall into difficulty, they approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for relief, whereas ak\u0101ma devotees, even in the greatest danger, never disturb the Lord for material benefits. Even if an ak\u0101ma devotee is suffering, he thinks this is due to his past impious activities and agrees to suffer the consequences. He never disturbs the Lord. Sak\u0101ma devotees immediately pray to the Lord as soon as they are in difficulty, but they are regarded as pious because they consider themselves fully dependent on the mercy of the Lord. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.8): Even while suffering in the midst of difficulties, devotees simply offer their prayers and service more enthusiastically. In this way they become firmly fixed in devotional service and eligible to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt. Sak\u0101ma devotees, of course, achieve from the Lord the results they desire from their prayers, but they do not immediately become fit to return to Godhead. It is to be noted herein that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, in His various incarnations, is always the protector of His devotees. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says: vividha\u1e41 bh\u0101va-p\u0101tratv\u0101t sarve vi\u1e63\u1e47or vibh\u016btaya\u1e25. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Personality of Godhead (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam). All the other incarnations proceed from Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u."

You are the complete whole. Therefore, of what do we need to inform You? You know everything because You are the original cause of the cosmic manifestation, the maintainer and the annihilator of the entire universal creation. You always engage in Your pastimes with Your spiritual and material energies, for You are the controller of all these varied energies. You exist within all living entities, within the cosmic manifestation, and also beyond them. You exist internally as Parabrahman and externally as the ingredients of the material creation. Therefore, although manifested in various stages, at different times and places, and in various bodies, You, the Personality of Godhead, are the original cause of all causes. Indeed, You are the original element. You are the witness of all activities, but because You are as great as the sky, You are never touched by any of them. You are the witness of everything as Parabrahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. O Supreme Personality of Godhead, nothing is unknown to You.",
        "purport": " The Absolute Truth exists in three phases of spiritual understanding \u2014 Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n (brahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate). Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. Brahman, the impersonal Absolute Truth, is all-pervading, and Param\u0101tm\u0101 is locally situated in everyone\u2019s heart, but Bhagav\u0101n, who is worshipable by the devotees, is the original cause of all causes. A pure devotee is aware that since nothing is unknown to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He need not be informed of a devotee\u2019s conveniences and inconveniences. A pure devotee knows that there is no need to ask the Absolute Truth for any material necessities. Therefore, while informing the Supreme Lord about their distress in being attacked by V\u1e5btr\u0101sura, the demigods apologized for offering prayers for their safety. A neophyte devotee, of course, approaches the Supreme Lord for relief from distress or poverty, or for speculative knowledge of the Lord. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.16) mentions four kinds of pious men who begin devotional service to the Lord \u2014 one who is distressed (\u0101rta), one in need of money (arth\u0101rth\u012b), one who is inquisitive (jij\u00f1\u0101su) and one who is searching for the Absolute Truth (j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b). A pure devotee, however, knows that since the Lord is omnipresent and omniscient, there is no need to offer prayers or worship Him for one\u2019s personal benefit. A pure devotee always engages in the service of the Lord without demanding anything. The Lord is present everywhere and knows the necessities of His devotees; consequently there is no need to disturb Him by asking Him for material benefits."

When the demigods are utterly helpless, they approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead in grief and with tears in their eyes, praying to the Lord, and thus they become almost pure devotees, free from material desires.

Demons, or atheists, always disturb the demigods, or devotees, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends to punish the atheists and demons and fulfill the desire of His devotees. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the original cause of everything, is the Supreme Person, above even Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, although there is no difference between these different forms of the Lord. As explained in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.46): K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expands Himself as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u the way a bright candle kindles another. Although there is no difference between the power of one candle and another, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is compared to the original candle. The word m\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-ya\u015base is significant herein because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always famous for relieving His devotee from danger. A devotee who has sacrificed everything for the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and whose only source of relief is the Lord is known as aki\u00f1cana. As expressed in the prayers offered by Queen Kunt\u012b, the Lord is aki\u00f1cana-vitta, the property of such a devotee. Those who are liberated from the bondage of conditioned life are elevated to the spiritual world, where they achieve five kinds of liberation \u2014 s\u0101yujya, s\u0101lokya, s\u0101r\u016bpya, s\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6di and s\u0101m\u012bpya. They personally associate with the Lord in five mellows \u2014 \u015b\u0101nta, d\u0101sya, sakhya, v\u0101tsalya and m\u0101dhurya. These rasas are all emanations from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As described by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, the original mellow, \u0101di-rasa, is conjugal love. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of pure and spiritual conjugal love."

Impersonalists cannot be purified, for they do not offer personal prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even though they sometimes offer prayers, the prayers are not directed toward the Supreme Person. Impersonalists sometimes show their incomplete knowledge by addressing the Lord as being nameless. They always offer prayers indirectly, saying, \u201cYou are this, You are that,\u201d but they do not know to whom they are praying. A devotee, however, always offers personal prayers. A devotee says, govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi: \u201cI offer my respectful obeisances unto Govinda, unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d That is the way to offer prayers. If one continues to offer such personal prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is eligible to become a pure devotee and return home, back to Godhead."

        "purport": " There are two classes of men \u2014 namely the k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a and the br\u0101hma\u1e47a. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is one who knows Brahman, the Absolute Truth, and who thus knows his real interest. A k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a, however, is one who has a material, bodily concept of life. Not knowing how to utilize his human or demigod life, a k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a is attracted by things created by the material modes of nature. The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47as, who always desire material benefits, are foolish, whereas br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who always desire spiritual benefits, are intelligent. If a k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a, not knowing his self-interest, foolishly asks for something material, one who awards it to him is also foolish. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, is not a foolish person; He is supremely intelligent. If someone comes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a asking for material benefits, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not award him the material things he desires. Instead, the Lord gives him intelligence so that he will forget his material desires and become attached to the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. In such cases, although the k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a offers prayers to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for material things, the Lord takes away whatever material possessions the k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a has and gives him the sense to become a devotee. As stated by the Lord in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.39): \u201cSince I am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take the nectar of the shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget illusory material enjoyment.\u201d If one sincerely prays to God for material possessions in exchange for devotional service, the Lord, who is not foolish like such an unintelligent devotee, shows him special favor by taking away whatever material possessions he has and gradually giving him the intelligence to be satisfied only by rendering service to His lotus feet. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments in this regard that if a foolish child requests his mother to give him poison, the mother, being intelligent, will certainly not give him poison, even though he requests it. A materialist does not know that to accept material possessions means to accept poison, or the repetition of birth and death. An intelligent person, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, aspires for liberation from material bondage. That is the real self-interest of a human being."

        "purport": " Here is the difference between the benedictions awarded by the demigods and those awarded by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Devotees of the demigods ask for benedictions simply for sense gratification, and therefore they have been described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20) as bereft of intelligence. \u201cThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.\u201d Conditioned souls are generally bereft of intelligence because of profound desires for sense gratification. They do not know what benedictions to ask. Therefore nondevotees are advised in the \u015b\u0101stras to worship various demigods to achieve material benefits. For example, if one wants a beautiful wife, he is advised to worship Um\u0101, or the goddess Durg\u0101. If one wants to be cured of a disease, he is advised to worship the sun-god. All requests for benedictions from the demigods, however, are due to material lust. The benedictions will be finished at the end of the cosmic manifestation, along with those who bestow them. If one approaches Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u for benedictions, the Lord will give him a benediction that will help him return home, back to Godhead. This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, instructs a devotee who constantly engages in His service how to approach Him at the end of his material body. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities, does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d This is the benediction of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. After giving up his body, a devotee returns home, back to Godhead. A devotee may foolishly ask for material benedictions, but Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not give him such benedictions, despite the devotee\u2019s prayers. Therefore people who are very attached to material life do not generally become devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Instead they become devotees of the demigods (k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante\u00a0\u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25).

The great saint Dadh\u012bci had perfect knowledge of how to perform fruitive activities, and he had advanced spiritual knowledge as well. Knowing this, the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras once approached him and begged him to instruct them in spiritual science (brahma-vidy\u0101). Dadh\u012bci Muni replied, \u201cI am now engaged in arranging sacrifices for fruitive activities. Come back some time later.\u201d When the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras left, Indra, the King of heaven, approached Dadh\u012bci and said, \u201cMy dear Muni, the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras are only physicians. Please do not instruct them in spiritual science. If you impart the spiritual science to them despite my warning, I shall punish you by cutting off your head.\u201d After warning Dadh\u012bci in this way, Indra returned to heaven. The A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras, who understood Indra\u2019s desires, returned and begged Dadh\u012bci for brahma-vidy\u0101. When the great saint Dadh\u012bci informed them of Indra\u2019s threat, the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras replied, \u201cLet us first cut off your head and replace it with the head of a horse. You can instruct brahma-vidy\u0101 through the horse\u2019s head, and when Indra returns and cuts off that head, we shall reward you and restore your original head.\u201d Since Dadh\u012bci had promised to impart brahma-vidy\u0101 to the A\u015bvin\u012b-kum\u0101ras, he agreed to their proposal. Therefore, because Dadh\u012bci imparted brahma-vidy\u0101 through the mouth of a horse, this brahma-vidy\u0101 is also known as A\u015bva\u015bira."
