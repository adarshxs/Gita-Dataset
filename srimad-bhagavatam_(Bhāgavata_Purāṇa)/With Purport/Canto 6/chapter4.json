Pr\u0101c\u012bnabarhi understood N\u0101rada properly and then left the kingdom to perform austerities in the forest. His ten sons, however, were performing austerities within the water, and therefore there was no king to see to the management of the world. When the ten sons, the Pracet\u0101s, came out of the water, they saw that the earth was overrun with trees. When the government neglects agriculture, which is necessary for the production of food, the land becomes covered with unnecessary trees. Of course, many trees are useful because they produce fruits and flowers, but many other trees are unnecessary. They could be used as fuel and the land cleared and used for agriculture. When the government is negligent, less grain is produced.

Although devotees undergo severe tapasya, however, they are vimanyava\u1e25, s\u0101dhava\u1e25, which means that they are never angry. They are always decorated with good qualities. Bh\u0101gavatam (3.25.21) states: A s\u0101dhu, a devotee, is never angry. Actually the real feature of devotees who undergo tapasya, austerity, is forgiveness. Although a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava has sufficient power in tapasya, he does not become angry when put into difficulty. If one undergoes tapasya but does not become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, however, one does not develop good qualities. For example, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and R\u0101va\u1e47a also performed great austerities, but they did so to demonstrate their demoniac tendencies. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas must meet many opponents while preaching the glories of the Lord, but \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu recommends that they not become angry while preaching. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has given this formula: t\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101d api sun\u012bcena taror api sahi\u1e63\u1e47un\u0101/ am\u0101nin\u0101 m\u0101nadena k\u012brtan\u012bya\u1e25 sad\u0101 hari\u1e25. \u201cOne should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.\u201d Those engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord should be humbler than grass and more tolerant than a tree; then they can preach the glories of the Lord without difficulty."

As confirmed in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.34): The conditioned souls may try to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead for many billions of years through their mental speculative processes, traveling at the speed of the mind or the wind, but still the Absolute Truth will remain inconceivable to them because a materialistic person cannot measure the length and breadth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s unlimited existence. If the Absolute Truth is beyond measurement, one may ask, how can one realize Him? The answer is given here by the word svayambhuve: one may understand Him or not, but nevertheless He is existing in His own spiritual potency."

        "purport": " The individual soul and the Supreme Soul live together within the body. This is confirmed in the Upani\u1e63ads by the analogy that two friendly birds live in one tree \u2014 one bird eating the fruit of the tree and the other simply witnessing and directing. Although the individual living being, who is compared to the bird that is eating, is sitting with his friend the Supreme Soul, the individual living being cannot see Him. Actually the Supersoul is directing the workings of his senses in the enjoyment of sense objects, but as these sense objects cannot see the senses, the conditioned soul cannot see the directing soul. The conditioned soul has desires, and the Supreme Soul fulfills them, but the conditioned soul is unable to see the Supreme Soul. Thus Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a offers his obeisances to the Supreme Soul, the Supersoul, even though unable to see Him. Another example given is that although ordinary citizens work under the direction of the government, they cannot understand how they are being governed or what the government is. In this regard, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya quotes the following verse from the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cAs the various servants in the different departments of big establishments cannot see the supreme managing director under whom they are working, the conditioned souls cannot see the supreme friend sitting within their bodies. Let us therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme, who is invisible to our material eyes.\u201d"

One is called suj\u00f1eyam, or very easily understood (generally by mental speculation), and the other is called durj\u00f1eyam, understood only with difficulty. Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization and Brahman realization are considered suj\u00f1eyam, but realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is durj\u00f1eyam. As described here, one attains the ultimate realization of the Personality of Godhead when one gives up the activities of the mind \u2014 thinking, feeling and willing \u2014 or, in other words, when mental speculation stops. This transcendental realization is above su\u1e63upti, deep sleep. In our gross conditional stage we perceive things through material experience and remembrance, and in the subtle stage we perceive the world in dreams. The process of vision also involves remembrance and also exists in a subtle form. Above gross experience and dreams is su\u1e63upti, deep sleep, and when one comes to the completely spiritual platform, transcending deep sleep, he attains trance, vi\u015buddha-sattva, or vasudeva-sattva, in which the Personality of Godhead is revealed.

The heart is covered by the three modes of material nature and the nine material elements [material nature, the total material energy, the ego, the mind and the five objects of sense gratification], and also by the five material elements and the ten senses. These twenty-seven elements constitute the external energy of the Lord. Great yog\u012bs meditate upon the Lord, who is situated as the Supersoul, Param\u0101tm\u0101, within the core of the heart. May that Supersoul be pleased with me. The Supersoul is realized when one is eager for liberation from the unlimited varieties of material life. One actually attains such liberation when he engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord and realizes the Lord because of his attitude of service. The Lord may be addressed by various spiritual names, which are inconceivable to the material senses. When will that Supreme Personality of Godhead be pleased with me?",
        "purport": " In his commentary to this verse, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura uses the word durvij\u00f1eyam, which means \u201cvery difficult to realize.\u201d The pure stage of existence is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.28), wherein K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination.\u201d Elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.14) the Lord says: \u201cAlways chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.\u201d One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead after transcending all material impediments. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also says in the G\u012bt\u0101 (7.3): \u201cOut of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.\u201d To understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one must undergo severe penances and austerities, but since the path of devotional service is perfect, by following this process one can very easily come to the spiritual platform and understand the Lord. This, too, is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55), wherein K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d Thus although the subject matter is durvij\u00f1eyam, extremely difficult to understand, it becomes easy if one follows the prescribed method. Coming in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is possible through pure devotional service, which begins with \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura quotes a verse from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.8.5): pravi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 kar\u1e47a-randhre\u1e47a sv\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 bh\u0101va-saroruham. The process of hearing and chanting enters the core of the heart, and in this way one becomes a pure devotee. By continuing this process, one comes to the stage of transcendental love, and then he appreciates the transcendental name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, a pure devotee, by devotional service, is able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead despite many material impediments, which are all various energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Easily making his way through these impediments, a devotee comes directly in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After all, the material impediments described in these verses are but various energies of the Lord. When a devotee is eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he prays to the Lord: \u201cO son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Nanda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death. Please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet.\u201d Being pleased with the devotee, the Lord turns all his material impediments into spiritual service. In this connection \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura quotes a verse from the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a: In the material world, the spiritual energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is manifested as t\u0101pa-kar\u012b, which means \u201ccausing miseries.\u201d Everyone hankers for happiness, but although happiness originally comes from the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the material world, because of material activities, the pleasure potency of the Lord becomes a source of miseries (hl\u0101da-t\u0101pa-kar\u012b). False happiness in the material world is the source of distress, but when one\u2019s endeavors for happiness are redirected toward the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this t\u0101pa-kar\u012b element of misery is vanquished. An example given in this connection is that extracting fire from wood is certainly difficult, but when the fire comes out it burns the wood to ashes. In other words, experiencing the Supreme Personality of Godhead is extremely difficult for those devoid of devotional service, but everything becomes easier for a devotee, and thus he can very easily meet the Supreme Lord. Here the prayers say that the form of the Lord is beyond the jurisdiction of material form and is therefore inconceivable. A devotee prays, however, \u201cMy dear Lord, be pleased with me so that I may very easily see Your transcendental form and potency.\u201d Nondevotees try to understand the Supreme Brahman by discussions of neti neti. Ni\u1e63edha-nirv\u0101\u1e47a-sukh\u0101nubh\u016bti\u1e25: a devotee, however, simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, avoids such laborious speculations and realizes the existence of the Lord very easily."

        "translation": "Anything expressed by material vibrations, anything ascertained by material intelligence and anything experienced by the material senses or concocted within the material mind is but an effect of the modes of material nature and therefore has nothing to do with the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is beyond the creation of this material world, for He is the source of the material qualities and creation. As the cause of all causes, He exists before the creation and after the creation. I wish to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.",
        "purport": " One who manufactures names, forms, qualities or paraphernalia pertaining to the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot understand Him, since He is beyond creation. The Supreme Lord is the creator of everything, and this means that He existed when there was no creation. In other words, His name, form and qualities are not materially created entities; they are transcendental always. Therefore by our material concoctions, vibrations and thoughts we cannot ascertain the Supreme Lord. This is explained in the verse ata\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101m\u0101di na bhaved gr\u0101hyam indriyai\u1e25. Pr\u0101cetasa, Dak\u1e63a, herein offers prayers unto the Transcendence, not to anyone within the material creation. Only fools and rascals think God a material creation. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11): \u201cFools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.\u201d Therefore, one must receive knowledge from a person to whom the Lord has revealed Himself; there is no value in creating an imaginary name or form for the Lord. \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya was an impersonalist, but nevertheless he said, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 paro\u00a0\u2019vyakt\u0101t: N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is not a person of the material world. We cannot assign N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a a material designation, as the foolish attempt to do when they speak of daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (poor N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a). N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is always transcendental, beyond this material creation. How can He become daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a? Poverty is found within this material world, but in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as poverty. Therefore the idea of daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is merely a concoction. Dak\u1e63a very carefully points out that material designations cannot be names of the worshipable Lord: yad yan nirukta\u1e41 vacas\u0101 nir\u016bpitam. Nirukta refers to the Vedic dictionary. One cannot properly understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead merely by picking up expressions from a dictionary. In praying to the Lord, Dak\u1e63a does not wish material names and forms to be the objects of his worship; rather, he wants to worship the Lord, who existed before the creation of material dictionaries and names. As confirmed in the Vedas, yato v\u0101co nivartante/ apr\u0101pya manas\u0101 saha: the name, form, attributes and paraphernalia of the Lord cannot be ascertained through a material dictionary. However, if one reaches the transcendental platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes well acquainted with everything, material and spiritual. This is confirmed in another Vedic mantra: tam eva viditv\u0101ti m\u1e5btyum eti. If one can somehow or other, by the grace of the Lord, understand the transcendental position of the Lord, one becomes eternal. This is further confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d Simply by understanding the Supreme Lord, one goes beyond birth, death, old age and disease. \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b therefore advised Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.1.5): \u201cO descendant of King Bharata, one who desires to be free from all miseries must hear, glorify and also remember the Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul, the controller and the savior from all miseries.\u201d"

Thus He creates within this material world a situation in which they are unable to come to a conclusion. I offer my obeisances unto Him.",
        "purport": " Since time immemorial or since the creation of the cosmic manifestation, the conditioned souls have formed various parties of philosophical speculation, but this is not true of the devotees. Nondevotees have different ideas of creation, maintenance and annihilation, and therefore they are called v\u0101d\u012bs and prativ\u0101d\u012bs \u2014 proponents and counterproponents. It is understood from the statement of Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that there are many munis, or speculators: All speculators must disagree with other speculators; otherwise, why should there be so many opposing parties concerned with ascertaining the supreme cause? Philosophy means finding the ultimate cause. As Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra very reasonably says, ath\u0101to brahma jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101: human life is meant for understanding the ultimate cause. Devotees accept that the ultimate cause is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because this conclusion is supported by all Vedic literature and also by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, who says, aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25: \u201cI am the source of everything.\u201d Devotees have no problem understanding the ultimate cause of everything, but nondevotees must face many opposing elements because everyone who wants to be a prominent philosopher invents his own way. In India there are many parties of philosophers, such as the dvaita-v\u0101d\u012bs, advaita-v\u0101d\u012bs, vai\u015be\u1e63ikas, m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas, M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and svabh\u0101va-v\u0101d\u012bs, and each of them opposes the others. Similarly, in the Western countries there are also many philosophers with different views of creation, life, maintenance and annihilation. Thus it is undoubtedly a fact that there are countless philosophers throughout the world, each of them contradicting the others. Now, one might ask why there are so many philosophers if the ultimate goal of philosophy is one. Undoubtedly the ultimate cause is one \u2014 the Supreme Brahman. As Arjuna told K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.12): \u201cYou are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading beauty.\u201d Nondevotee speculators, however, do not accept an ultimate cause (sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am). Because they are ignorant and bewildered concerning the soul and its activities, even though some of them have a vague idea of the soul, many controversies arise, and the philosophical speculators can never reach a conclusion. All of these speculators are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.19-20): \u201cThose who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life. Attaining repeated birth among the species of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.\u201d Because of their envy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nondevotees are born in demoniac families life after life. They are great offenders, and because of their offenses the Supreme Lord keeps them always bewildered. Kurvanti cai\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 muhur \u0101tma-moham: the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, purposely keeps them in darkness (\u0101tma-moham). The great authority Par\u0101\u015bara, the father of Vy\u0101sadeva, explains the Supreme Personality of Godhead thus: The demoniac speculators cannot understand the transcendental qualities, form, pastimes, strength, knowledge and opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which are all free from material contamination (vin\u0101 heyair gu\u1e47\u0101dibhi\u1e25). These speculators are envious of the existence of the Lord. Jagad \u0101hur an\u012b\u015bvaram: their conclusion is that the entire cosmic manifestation has no controller, but is just working naturally. Thus they are kept in constant darkness, birth after birth, and cannot understand the real cause of all causes. This is the reason why there are so many schools of philosophical speculation."

        "purport": " Actually there are two sides to this argument. Some say that the Absolute has no form (nir\u0101k\u0101ra), and others say that the Absolute has a form (s\u0101k\u0101ra). Therefore the word form is the common factor, although some accept it (asti or astika) whereas others try to negate it (n\u0101sti or n\u0101stika). Since the devotee considers the word \u201cform\u201d (\u0101k\u0101ra) the common factor for both, he offers his respectful obeisances to the form, although others may go on arguing about whether the Absolute has a form or not. In this verse the word yoga-s\u0101\u1e45khyayo\u1e25 is very important. Yoga means bhakti-yoga because yog\u012bs also accept the existence of the all-pervading Supreme Soul and try to see that Supreme Soul within their hearts. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.13.1), dhy\u0101n\u0101vasthita-tad-gatena manas\u0101 pa\u015byanti ya\u1e41 yogina\u1e25. The devotee tries to come directly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the yog\u012b tries to find the Supersoul within the heart by meditation. Thus, both directly and indirectly, yoga means bhakti-yoga. S\u0101\u1e45khya, however, means physical study of the cosmic situation through speculative knowledge. This is generally known as j\u00f1\u0101na-\u015b\u0101stra. The S\u0101\u1e45khyites are attached to the impersonal Brahman, but the Absolute Truth is known in three ways. Brahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate: the Absolute Truth is one, but some accept Him as impersonal Brahman, some as the Supersoul existing everywhere, and some as Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The central point is the Absolute Truth. Although the impersonalists and personalists fight with one another, they focus upon the same Parabrahman, the same Absolute Truth. In the yoga-\u015b\u0101stras, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as follows: k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e41 pi\u015ba\u1e45g\u0101mbaram ambujek\u1e63a\u1e47a\u1e41 catur-bhuja\u1e41 \u015ba\u1e45kha-gad\u0101dy-ud\u0101yudham. Thus the pleasing appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s bodily features, His limbs and His dress are described. The s\u0101\u1e45khya-\u015b\u0101stra, however, denies the existence of the Lord\u2019s transcendental form. The s\u0101\u1e45khya-\u015b\u0101stra says that the Supreme Absolute Truth has no hands, no legs and no name: hy an\u0101ma-r\u016bpa-gu\u1e47a-p\u0101\u1e47i-p\u0101dam acak\u1e63ur a\u015brotram ekam advit\u012byam api n\u0101ma-r\u016bp\u0101dika\u1e41 n\u0101sti. The Vedic mantras say, ap\u0101\u1e47i-p\u0101do javano grah\u012bt\u0101: the Supreme Lord has no legs and hands, but He can accept whatever is offered to Him. Actually such statements accept that the Supreme has hands and legs, but deny that He has material hands and legs. This is why the Absolute is called apr\u0101k\u1e5bta. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has a sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, a form of eternity, knowledge and bliss, not a material form. The S\u0101\u1e45khyites, or j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, deny the material form, and the devotees also know very well that the Absolute Truth, Bhagav\u0101n, has no material form. \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes.\u201d The conception of the Absolute without hands and legs and the conception of the Absolute with hands and legs are apparently contradictory, but they both coincide with the same truth about the Supreme Absolute Person. Therefore the word vastu-ni\u1e63\u1e6dhayo\u1e25, which is used herein, indicates that both the yog\u012bs and S\u0101\u1e45khyites have faith in the reality, but are arguing about it from the different viewpoints of material and spiritual identities. Parabrahman, or b\u1e5bhat, is the common point. The S\u0101\u1e45khyites and yog\u012bs are both situated in that same Brahman, but they differ because of different angles of vision. The directions given by the bhakti-\u015b\u0101stra point one in the perfect direction because the Supreme Personality of Godhead says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti: \u201cOnly by devotional service am I to be known.\u201d The bhaktas know that the Supreme Person has no material form, whereas the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs simply deny the material form. One should therefore take shelter of the bhakti-m\u0101rga, the path of devotion; then everything will be clear. J\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs concentrate on the vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa, the gigantic universal form of the Lord. This is a good system in the beginning for those who are extremely materialistic, but there is no need to think continuously of the vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa. When Arjuna was shown the vir\u0101\u1e6d-r\u016bpa of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he saw it, but he did not want to see it perpetually. He therefore requested the Lord to return to His original form as two-armed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In conclusion, learned scholars find no contradictions in the devotees\u2019 concentration upon the spiritual form of the Lord (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25). In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says that less intelligent nondevotees think that their conclusion is the ultimate, but because devotees are completely learned, they can understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal."

Thus He exhibits transcendental forms and names with His different pastimes. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is eternal and full of knowledge and bliss, be merciful to me.",
        "purport": " In regard to the significant word an\u0101ma-r\u016bpa\u1e25, \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b says, pr\u0101k\u1e5bta-n\u0101ma-r\u016bpa-rahito\u00a0\u2019pi. The word an\u0101ma, which means \u201chaving no name,\u201d indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material name. Simply by chanting the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a to call his son, Aj\u0101mila attained salvation. This means that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is not an ordinary mundane name; it is nonmaterial. The word an\u0101ma, therefore, indicates that the names of the Supreme Lord do not belong to this material world. The vibration of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra is not a material sound, and similarly the form of the Lord and His appearance and activities are all nonmaterial. To show His causeless mercy to the devotees, as well as to the nondevotees, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in this material world with names, forms and pastimes, all of which are transcendental. Unintelligent men who cannot understand this think that these names, forms and pastimes are material, and therefore they deny that He has a name or a form. Considered with scrutiny, the conclusion of nondevotees, who say that God has no name, and that of devotees, who know that His name is not material, are practically the same. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material name, form, birth, appearance or disappearance, but nevertheless, He takes His birth (janma). As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.6): Although the Lord is unborn (aja) and His body never undergoes material changes, He nevertheless appears as an incarnation, maintaining Himself always in the transcendental stage (\u015buddha-sattva). Thus He exhibits His transcendental forms, names and activities. That is His special mercy toward His devotees. Others may continue merely arguing about whether the Absolute Truth has form or not, but when a devotee, by the grace of the Lord, sees the Lord personally, he becomes spiritually ecstatic. Unintelligent persons say that the Lord does nothing. Actually He has nothing to do, but nevertheless He has to do everything, because without His sanction no one can do anything. The unintelligent, however, cannot see how He is working and how the entire material nature is working under His direction. His different potencies work perfectly. He has nothing to do personally, for since His potencies are perfect, everything is immediately done by His will. Persons to whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not revealed cannot see how He is working, and therefore they think that even if there is God, He has nothing to do or has no particular name. Actually the Lord\u2019s name already exists because of His transcendental activities. The Lord is sometimes called gu\u1e47a-karma-n\u0101ma because He is named according to His transcendental activities. For example, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means \u201call-attractive.\u201d This is the Lord\u2019s name because His transcendental qualities make Him very attractive. As a small boy He lifted Govardhana Hill, and in His childhood He killed many demons. Such activities are very attractive, and therefore He is sometimes called Giridh\u0101r\u012b, Madhus\u016bdana, Agha-ni\u1e63\u016bdana and so on. Because He acted as the son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, He is called Nanda-tanuja. These names already exist, but since nondevotees cannot understand the names of the Lord, He is sometimes called an\u0101ma, or nameless. This means that He has no material names. All His activities are spiritual, and therefore He has spiritual names. Generally, less intelligent men are under the impression that the Lord has no form. Therefore He appears in His original form as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, to carry out His mission of participating in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra and pastimes to protect the devotees and vanquish the demons (paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m). This is His mercy. For those who think that He has no form and no work to do, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes to show that indeed He works. He works so gloriously that no one else can perform such uncommon acts. Although He appeared as a human being, He married 16,108 wives, which is impossible for a human being to do. The Lord performs such activities to show people how great He is, how affectionate He is and how merciful He is. Although His original name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam), He acts in unlimited ways, and therefore according to His work He has many, many thousands of names."

What is the use of these other forms? May the original Supreme Personality of Godhead please fulfill my desires.",
        "purport": " The impersonalists imagine the various demigods to be forms of the Lord. For example, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs worship five demigods (pa\u00f1cop\u0101san\u0101). They do not actually believe in the form of the Lord, but for the sake of worship they imagine some form to be God. Generally they imagine a form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, a form of \u015aiva, and forms of Ga\u1e47e\u015ba, the sun-god and Durg\u0101. This is called pa\u00f1cop\u0101san\u0101. Dak\u1e63a, however, wanted to worship not an imaginary form, but the supreme form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura describes the difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and an ordinary living being. As pointed out in a previous verse, sarva\u1e41 pum\u0101n veda gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e41\u015b ca taj-j\u00f1o na veda sarva j\u00f1am anantam \u012b\u1e0de: the omnipotent Supreme Lord knows everything, but the living being does not actually know the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u201cI know everything, but no one knows Me.\u201d This is the difference between the Supreme Lord and an ordinary living being. In a prayer in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Queen Kunt\u012b says, \u201cMy dear Lord, You exist inside and outside, yet no one can see You.\u201d The conditioned soul cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by speculative knowledge or by imagination. One must therefore know the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He reveals Himself, but He cannot be understood by speculation. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.29): \u201cMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years.\u201d This is the verdict of the \u015b\u0101stra. An ordinary man may be a great philosopher and may speculate upon what the Absolute Truth is, what His form is and where He is existing, but he cannot understand these truths. Sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau svayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25: one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead only through devotional service. This is also explained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55). Bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25: \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service.\u201d Unintelligent persons want to imagine or concoct a form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but devotees want to worship the actual Personality of Godhead. Therefore Dak\u1e63a prays, \u201cOne may think of You as personal, impersonal or imaginary, but I wish to pray to Your Lordship that You fulfill my desires to see You as You actually are.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments that this verse is especially meant for the impersonalist, who thinks that he himself is the Supreme because there is no difference between the living being and God. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosopher thinks that there is only one Supreme Truth and that he is also that Supreme Truth. Actually this is not knowledge but foolishness, and this verse is especially meant for such fools, whose knowledge has been stolen by illusion (m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25). Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that such persons, j\u00f1\u0101ni-m\u0101nina\u1e25, think themselves very advanced, but actually they are unintelligent. In regard to this verse, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says: There are three classes of men \u2014 the lowest (adhama), those in the middle (madhyama), and the best (uttama). The lowest (adhama) think that there is no difference between God and the living entity except that the living entity is under designations whereas the Absolute Truth has no designations. In their opinion, as soon as the designations of the material body are dissolved, the j\u012bva, the living entity, will mix with the Supreme. They give the argument of gha\u1e6d\u0101k\u0101\u015ba-pa\u1e6d\u0101k\u0101\u015ba, in which the body is compared to a pot with the sky within and the sky without. When the pot breaks, the sky inside becomes one with the sky outside, and so the impersonalists say that the living being becomes one with the Supreme. This is their argument, but \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says that such an argument is put forward by the lowest class of men. Another class of men cannot ascertain what the actual form of the Supreme is, but they agree that there is a Supreme who controls the activities of the ordinary living being. Such philosophers are accepted as mediocre. The best, however, are those who understand the Supreme Lord (sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha). P\u016br\u1e47\u0101nand\u0101di-gu\u1e47aka\u1e41 sarva j\u012bva-vilak\u1e63a\u1e47am: His form is completely spiritual, full of bliss, and completely distinct from that of the conditioned soul or any other living entity. Uttam\u0101s tu hari\u1e41 pr\u0101hus t\u0101ratamyena te\u1e63u ca: such philosophers are the best because they know that the Supreme Personality of Godhead reveals Himself differently to worshipers in various modes of material nature. They know that there are thirty-three million demigods just to convince the conditioned soul that there is a supreme power and to induce him to agree to worship one of these demigods so that by the association of devotees he may be able to understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat ki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1jaya: \u201cThere is no truth superior to Me.\u201d Aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m: \u201cI am the origin of all the demigods.\u201d Aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25: \u201cI am superior to everyone, even Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva and the other demigods.\u201d These are the conclusions of the \u015b\u0101stra, and one who accepts these conclusions should be considered a first-class philosopher. Such a philosopher knows that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord of the demigods (deva-deve\u015bvara\u1e41 s\u016btram \u0101nanda\u1e41 pr\u0101\u1e47a-vedina\u1e25)."

His garments were yellow and His bodily hue deep bluish. His eyes and face were very cheerful, and from His neck to His feet hung a long garland of flowers. His chest was decorated with the Kaustubha jewel and the mark of \u015ar\u012bvatsa. On His head was a gorgeous round helmet, and His ears were decorated with earrings resembling sharks. All these ornaments were uncommonly beautiful. The Lord wore a golden belt on His waist, bracelets on His arms, rings on His fingers, and ankle bells on His feet. Thus decorated by various ornaments, Lord Hari, who is attractive to all the living entities of the three worlds, is known as Puru\u1e63ottama, the best personality. He was accompanied by great devotees like N\u0101rada, Nanda and all the principal demigods, led by the heavenly king, Indra, and the residents of various upper planetary systems such as Siddhaloka, Gandharvaloka and C\u0101ra\u1e47aloka.

        "purport": " After every dissolution of the material cosmos, all the living entities take shelter in the body of K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and when creation takes place again, they come forth from His body in their various species to resume their activities. Why does the creation take place in such a way that the living entities are put into conditioned life to suffer the threefold miseries imposed upon them by the material nature? Here the Lord says to Dak\u1e63a, \u201cYou desire to benefit all living entities, and that is also My desire.\u201d The living entities who come in contact with the material world are meant to be corrected. All the living entities within this material world have revolted against the service of the Lord, and therefore they remain within this material world as ever conditioned, nitya-baddha, taking birth again and again. There is a chance, of course, of their being liberated, but nevertheless the conditioned souls, not taking advantage of this opportunity, continue in a life of sense enjoyment, and thus they are punished by birth and death again and again. This is the law of nature. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): \u201cThis divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.\u201d Elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7) the Lord says: \u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\u201d The living entity\u2019s struggle for existence within the material world is due to his rebellious nature. Unless a living entity surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he must continue this life of struggle. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is not a fad. It is a bona fide movement intended to promote the welfare of all conditioned souls by trying to elevate everyone to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one does not come to this platform, he must continue in material existence perpetually, sometimes in the upper planets and sometimes in the lower planets. As confirmed in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 20.118), kabhu svarge u\u1e6dh\u0101ya, kabhu narake \u1e0dub\u0101ya: the conditioned soul sometimes descends into nescience and sometimes gets some relief by being relatively freed from it. This is the life of the conditioned soul. Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a is trying to benefit the conditioned souls by begetting them to give them a life with a chance for liberation. Liberation means surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one begets children with the purpose of training them to surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, fatherhood is very good. Similarly, when the spiritual master trains the conditioned souls to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, his position is successful. If one gives the conditioned souls a chance to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, all his activities are approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is extremely pleased, as stated here (pr\u012bto\u00a0\u2019ham). Following the examples of the previous \u0101c\u0101ryas, all the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement should try to benefit the conditioned souls by inducing them to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and giving them all facilities to do so. Such activities constitute real welfare work. By such activities, a preacher or anyone who endeavors to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.68-69): \u201cFor one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me. There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear.\u201d"

        "purport": " Sometimes atheists argue that since God is invisible to their eyes, they do not believe in God. For them the Supreme Lord is describing a method by which one can see God in His impersonal form. Intelligent persons can see God in His personal form, as stated in the \u015b\u0101stras, but if one is very eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead immediately, face to face, he can see the Supreme Lord through this description, which portrays the various internal and external parts of His body. To engage in tapasya, or denial of material activities, is the first principle of spiritual life. Then there are spiritual activities, such as the performance of Vedic ritualistic sacrifices, study of the Vedic knowledge, meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. One should also respect the demigods and understand how they are situated, how they act and how they manage the activities of the various departments of this material world. In this way one can see how God is existing and how everything is managed perfectly because of the presence of the Supreme Lord. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10): \u201cThis material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt\u012b, and it is producing all moving and nonmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.\u201d If one is unable to see the Supreme Lord although He is present as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His various incarnations, one may see the Supreme Lord\u2019s impersonal feature, according to the direction of the Vedas, by seeing the activities of material nature. Anything done under the direction of the Vedic injunctions is called dharma, as described by the order carriers of Yamar\u0101ja (Bh\u0101g. 6.1.40): \u201cThat which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious principles, and the opposite of that is irreligion. The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamar\u0101ja.\u201d In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya comments: The various demigods are all acting under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and according to their various actions the demigods are differently named."

        "purport": " The word aham indicates a person. As explained in the Vedas, nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13): the Lord is the supreme eternal among innumerable eternals and the supreme living being among the innumerable living beings. The Lord is a person who also has impersonal features. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.11): \u201cLearned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 or Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d Consideration of the Param\u0101tm\u0101 and impersonal Brahman arose after the creation; before the creation, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead existed. As firmly declared in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55), the Lord can be understood only by bhakti-yoga. The ultimate cause, the supreme cause of creation, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can be understood only by bhakti-yoga. He cannot be understood by speculative philosophical research or by meditation, since all such processes came into existence after the material creation. The impersonal and localized conceptions of the Supreme Lord are more or less materially contaminated. The real spiritual process, therefore, is bhakti-yoga. As the Lord says, bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti: \u201cOnly by devotional service can I be understood.\u201d Before the creation, the Lord existed as a person, as indicated here by the word aham. When Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a saw Him as a person, who was beautifully dressed and ornamented, he actually experienced the meaning of this word aham through devotional service. Each person is eternal. Because the Lord says that He existed as a person before the creation (agre) and will also exist after the annihilation, the Lord is a person eternally. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore quotes these verses from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.9.13-14): The Personality of Godhead appeared in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as the son of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, who bound the Lord with rope just as an ordinary mother binds a material child. There are actually no divisions of external and internal for the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha), but when He appears in His own form the unintelligent think Him an ordinary person. Avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam: although He comes in His own body, which never changes, m\u016b\u1e0dhas, the unintelligent, think that the impersonal Brahman has assumed a material body to come in the form of a person. Ordinary living beings assume material bodies, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme consciousness, it is stated herein that sa\u1e41j\u00f1\u0101na-m\u0101tram, the original consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, was unmanifested before the creation, although the consciousness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of everything. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.12), \u201cNever was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.\u201d Thus the Lord\u2019s person is the Absolute Truth in the past, present and future. In this regard, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya quotes two verses from the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a: After the annihilation of everything, the Supreme Lord, because of His sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, remains in His original form, but since the other living entities have material bodies, the matter merges into matter, and the subtle form of the spirit soul remains within the body of the Lord. The Lord does not sleep, but the ordinary living entities remain asleep until the next creation. An unintelligent person thinks that the opulence of the Supreme Lord is nonexistent after the annihilation, but that is not a fact. The opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead remains as it is in the spiritual world; only in the material world is everything dissolved. Brahma-l\u012bna, merging into the Supreme Brahman, is not actual l\u012bna, or annihilation, for the subtle form remaining in the Brahman effulgence will return to the material world after the material creation and again assume a material form. This is described as bh\u016btv\u0101 bh\u016btv\u0101 pral\u012byate. When the material body is annihilated, the spirit soul remains in a subtle form, which later assumes another material body. This is true for the conditioned souls, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead remains eternally in His original consciousness and spiritual body."

She is very fertile, and therefore you will be able to have as many children as you can beget.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks in this connection that Dak\u1e63a was given the facility for unlimited sexual intercourse. In Dak\u1e63a\u2019s previous life he was also known as Dak\u1e63a, but in the course of performing sacrifices he offended Lord \u015aiva, and thus his head was replaced with that of a goat. Then Dak\u1e63a gave up his life because of his degraded condition, but because he maintained the same unlimited sexual desires, he underwent austerities by which he satisfied the Supreme Lord, who then gave him unlimited potency for sexual intercourse. It should be noted that although such a facility for sexual intercourse is achieved by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this facility is not offered to advanced devotees, who are free from material desires (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam). In this connection it may be noted that if the American boys and girls engaged in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement want to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to achieve the supreme benefit of loving service to the Lord, they should refrain from indulging in this facility for sex life. Therefore we advise that one should at least refrain from illicit sex. Even if there are opportunities for sex life, one should voluntarily accept the limitation of having sex only for progeny, not for any other purpose. Kardama Muni was also given the facility for sex life, but he had only a slight desire for it. Therefore after begetting children in the womb of Devah\u016bti, Kardama Muni became completely renounced. The purport is that if one wants to return home, back to Godhead, one should voluntarily refrain from sex life. Sex should be accepted only as much as needed, not unlimitedly. One should not think that Dak\u1e63a received the favor of the Lord by receiving the facilities for unlimited sex. Later verses will reveal that Dak\u1e63a again committed an offense, this time at the lotus feet of N\u0101rada. Therefore although sex life is the topmost enjoyment in the material world and although one may have an opportunity for sexual enjoyment by the grace of God, this entails a risk of committing offenses. Dak\u1e63a was open to such offenses, and therefore, strictly speaking, he was not actually favored by the Supreme Lord. One should not seek the favor of the Lord for unlimited potency in sex life."
