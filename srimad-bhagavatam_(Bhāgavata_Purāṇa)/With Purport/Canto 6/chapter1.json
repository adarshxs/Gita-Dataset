        "translation": "Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it said: O my lord, O \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, you have already described [in the Second Canto] the path of liberation [niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga]. By following that path, one is certainly elevated gradually to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, from which one is promoted to the spiritual world along with Lord Brahm\u0101. Thus one\u2019s repetition of birth and death in the material world ceases.",
        "purport": " Since Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, when he heard the description, at the end of the Fifth Canto, of the different hellish conditions of life, he was very much concerned with how to liberate the conditioned souls from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 and take them back home, back to Godhead. Therefore he reminded his spiritual master, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, about the niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga, or path of liberation, which he had described in the Second Canto. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, who at the time of death was fortunate to have met \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, inquired from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b about the path of liberation at that crucial time. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b very much appreciated his question and congratulated him by saying: \u201cMy dear King, your question is glorious because it is very beneficial for all kinds of people. The answer to this question is the prime subject matter for hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.1.1) Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was astonished that the living entities in the conditional stage do not accept the path of liberation, devotional service, instead of suffering in so many hellish conditions. This is the symptom of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. V\u0101\u00f1ch\u0101-kalpa-tarubhya\u015b ca k\u1e5bp\u0101-sindhubhya eva ca: a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is an ocean of mercy. Para-du\u1e25kha-du\u1e25kh\u012b: he is unhappy because of the unhappiness of others. Therefore Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, being compassionate toward the conditioned souls suffering in hellish life, suggested that \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b continue describing the path of liberation, which he had explained in the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The word asa\u1e41s\u1e5bti is very important in this connection. Sa\u1e41s\u1e5bti refers to continuing on the path of birth and death. Asa\u1e41s\u1e5bti, on the contrary, refers to niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga, or the path of liberation, by which one\u2019s birth and death cease and one gradually progresses to Brahmaloka, unless one is a pure devotee who does not care about going to the higher planetary systems, in which case one immediately returns home, back to Godhead, by executing devotional service (tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti). Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, therefore, was very eager to hear from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b about the path of liberation for the conditioned soul. According to the opinion of the \u0101c\u0101ryas, the word krama-yogopalabdhena indicates that by first performing karma-yoga and then j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and finally coming to the platform of bhakti-yoga, one can be liberated. Bhakti-yoga, however, is so powerful that it does not depend on karma-yoga or j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. Bhakti-yoga itself is so powerful that even an impious man with no assets in karma-yoga or an illiterate with no assets in j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga can undoubtedly be elevated to the spiritual world if he simply adheres to bhakti-yoga. M\u0101m evai\u1e63yasy asa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.7) that by the process of bhakti-yoga one undoubtedly goes back to Godhead, back home to the spiritual world. Yog\u012bs, however, instead of going directly to the spiritual world, sometimes want to see other planetary systems, and therefore they ascend to the planetary system where Lord Brahm\u0101 lives, as indicated here by the word brahma\u1e47\u0101. At the time of dissolution, Lord Brahm\u0101, along with all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka, goes directly to the spiritual world. This is confirmed in the Vedas as follows: \u201cBecause of their exalted position, those who are on Brahmaloka at the time of dissolution go directly back home, back to Godhead, along with Lord Brahm\u0101.\u201d"

        "translation": "O great sage \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, unless the living entity is freed from the infection of the material modes of nature, he receives different types of bodies in which to enjoy or suffer, and according to the body, he is understood to have various inclinations. By following these inclinations he traverses the path called prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga, by which one may be elevated to the heavenly planets, as you have already described [in the Third Canto].",
        "purport": " As Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25): \u201cThose who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with Me.\u201d Because of the influence of the various modes of nature, the living entities have various tendencies or propensities, and therefore they are qualified to achieve various destinations. As long as one is materially attached, he wants to be elevated to the heavenly planets because of his attraction to the material world. The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares, however, \u201cThose who worship Me come to Me.\u201d If one has no information about the Supreme Lord and His abode, one tries to be elevated only to a higher material position, but when one concludes that in this material world there is nothing but repeated birth and death, he tries to return home, back to Godhead. If one attains that destination, he need never return to this material world (yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante tad dh\u0101ma parama\u1e41 mama). As \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 19.151): \u201cAccording to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By the mercy of both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.\u201d All living entities are rotating throughout the universe, going sometimes up to the higher planetary systems and sometimes down to the lower planets. This is the material disease, which is known as prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga. When one becomes intelligent he takes to niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga, the path of liberation, and thus instead of rotating within this material world, he returns home, back to Godhead. This is necessary."

Atheists try to conceal the hand of God, which is present in every creation, but they cannot explain how all these creations could come into existence without a competent intelligence and almighty power behind them. Simply to imagine or speculate is a waste of time. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8), the Lord says, aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhavo: \u201cI am the origin of everything.\u201d Matta\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 pravartate: \u201cWhatever exists in the creation emanates from Me.\u201d Iti matv\u0101 bhajante m\u0101\u1e41 budh\u0101 bh\u0101va-samanvit\u0101\u1e25: \u201cWhen one fully understands that I create everything by My omnipotence, one becomes firmly situated in devotional service and fully surrenders at My lotus feet.\u201d Unfortunately, the unintelligent cannot immediately understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supremacy. Nonetheless, if they associate with devotees and read authorized books, they may gradually come to the proper understanding, although this may take many, many births. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19): \u201cAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.\u201d V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the creator of everything, and His energy is displayed in various ways. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.4-5), a combination of the material energy (bh\u016bmir \u0101po\u00a0\u2019nalo v\u0101yu\u1e25) and the spiritual energy, the living entity, exists in every creation. Therefore the same principle, the combination of the supreme spirit and the material elements, is the cause of the cosmic manifestation."

        "purport": " In the Twenty-sixth Chapter of the Fifth Canto, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has explained that people who commit sinful acts are forced to enter hellish planets and suffer. Now Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, being a devotee, is concerned with how this can be stopped. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is para-du\u1e25kha-du\u1e25kh\u012b; in other words, he has no personal troubles, but he is very unhappy to see others in trouble. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said, \u201cMy Lord, I have no personal problems, for I have learned how to glorify Your transcendental qualities and thus enter a trance of ecstasy. I do have a problem, however, for I am simply thinking of these rascals and fools who are busy with m\u0101y\u0101-sukha, temporary happiness, without knowledge of devotional service unto You.\u201d This is the problem faced by a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Because a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava fully takes shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he personally has no problems, but because he is compassionate toward the fallen, conditioned souls, he is always thinking of plans to save them from their hellish life in this body and the next. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, therefore, anxiously wanted to know from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b how humanity can be saved from gliding down to hell. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b had already explained how people enter hellish life, and he could also explain how they could be saved from it. Intelligent men must take advantage of these instructions. Unfortunately, however, the entire world is lacking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore people are suffering from the grossest ignorance and do not even believe in a life after this one. To convince them of their next life is very difficult because they have become almost mad in their pursuit of material enjoyment. Nevertheless, our duty, the duty of all sane men, is to save them. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it is the representative of one who can save them."

As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): Devotional service is so strong that if one fully surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and takes fully to His devotional service, the reactions of his sinful life immediately stop. Elsewhere in the G\u012bt\u0101 (18.66), Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a urges that one give up all other duties and surrender to Him, and He promises, aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi: \u201cI shall free you from all sinful reactions and give you liberation.\u201d Therefore in response to the inquiries of Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, his guru, could have immediately explained the principle of bhakti, but to test Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s intelligence, he first prescribed atonement according to karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, the path of fruitive activities. For karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da there are eighty authorized scriptures, such as Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, which are known as dharma-\u015b\u0101stras. In these scriptures one is advised to counteract his sinful acts by performing other types of fruitive action. This was the path first recommended by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it, and actually it is a fact that one who does not take to devotional service must follow the decision of these scriptures by performing pious acts to counteract his impious acts. This is known as atonement."

        "purport": " The dharma-\u015b\u0101stras like the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 prescribe that a man who has committed murder should be hanged and his own life sacrificed in atonement. Previously this system was followed all over the world, but since people are becoming atheists, they are stopping capital punishment. This is not wise. Herein it is said that a physician who knows how to diagnose a disease prescribes medicine accordingly. If the disease is very serious, the medicine must be strong. The weight of a murderer\u2019s sin is very great, and therefore according to Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 a murderer must be killed. By killing a murderer the government shows mercy to him because if a murderer is not killed in this life, he will be killed and forced to suffer many times in future lives. Since people do not know about the next life and the intricate workings of nature, they manufacture their own laws, but they should properly consult the established injunctions of the \u015b\u0101stras and act accordingly. In India even today the Hindu community often takes advice from expert scholars regarding how to counteract sinful activities. In Christianity also there is a process of confession and atonement. Therefore atonement is required, and atonement must be undergone according to the gravity of one\u2019s sinful acts."

Nevertheless, in spite of such knowledge, one is forced to commit sins again and again, even after performing acts of atonement. Therefore, what is the value of such atonement?",

This is the practice of a professional sinner. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s observations indicate that even five thousand years ago it was the practice of criminals to atone for their crimes but then commit the same crimes again, as if forced to do so. Therefore, owing to his practical experience, Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja saw that the process of repeatedly sinning and atoning is pointless. Regardless of how many times he is punished, one who is attached to sense enjoyment will commit sinful acts again and again until he is trained to refrain from enjoying his senses. The word viva\u015ba is used herein, indicating that even one who does not want to commit sinful acts will be forced to do so by habit. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore considered the process of atonement to have little value for saving one from sinful acts.

Now \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b is suggesting the platform of speculative knowledge. Progressing from karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da to j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, he is proposing, pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta\u1e41 vimar\u015banam: \u201cReal atonement is full knowledge.\u201d Vimar\u015bana refers to the cultivation of speculative knowledge. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, karm\u012bs, who are lacking in knowledge, are compared to asses. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.15): \u201cThose miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.\u201d Thus karm\u012bs who engage in sinful acts and who do not know the true objective of life are called m\u016b\u1e0dhas, asses. Vimar\u015bana, however, is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: the purpose of Vedic study is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one studies Ved\u0101nta but merely advances somewhat in speculative knowledge and does not understand the Supreme Lord, one remains the same m\u016b\u1e0dha. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19), one attains real knowledge when he understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and surrenders unto Him (bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate). To become learned and free from material contamination, therefore, one should try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for thus one is immediately liberated from all pious and impious activities and their reactions."

There is every chance of falling from the platform of karma to hellish conditions, but on the platform of j\u00f1\u0101na one is saved from hellish life, although one is still not completely free from infection. The difficulty is that on the platform of j\u00f1\u0101na one thinks that he has been liberated and has become N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or Bhagav\u0101n. This is another phase of ignorance. Because of ignorance, one speculatively thinks himself liberated from material contamination although actually he is not.

Thus a sober and faithful person who knows the religious principles is temporarily purified of all sins performed with his body, words and mind. These sins are like the dried leaves of creepers beneath a bamboo tree, which may be burned by fire although their roots remain to grow again at the first opportunity.",
        "purport": " Tapa\u1e25 is explained in the sm\u1e5bti-\u015b\u0101stra as follows: manasa\u015b cendriy\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 ca aik\u0101grya\u1e41 parama\u1e41 tapa\u1e25. \u201cComplete control of the mind and senses and their complete concentration on one kind of activity is called tapa\u1e25.\u201d Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is teaching people how to concentrate the mind on devotional service. This is first-class tapa\u1e25. Brahmacarya, the life of celibacy, has eight aspects: one should not think of women, speak about sex life, dally with women, look lustfully at women, talk intimately with women or decide to engage in sexual intercourse, nor should one endeavor for sex life or engage in sex life. One should not even think of women or look at them, to say nothing of talking with them. This is called first-class brahmacarya. If a brahmac\u0101r\u012b or sanny\u0101s\u012b talks with a woman in a secluded place, naturally there will be a possibility of sex life without anyone\u2019s knowledge. Therefore a complete brahmac\u0101r\u012b practices just the opposite. If one is a perfect brahmac\u0101r\u012b, he can very easily control the mind and senses, give charity, speak truthfully and so forth. To begin, however, one must control the tongue and the process of eating. In the bhakti-m\u0101rga, the path of devotional service, one must strictly follow the regulative principles by first controlling the tongue (sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dau svayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25). The tongue (jihv\u0101) can be controlled if one chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, does not speak of any subjects other than those concerning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and does not taste anything not offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one can control the tongue in this way, brahmacarya and other purifying processes will automatically follow. It will be explained in the next verse that the path of devotional service is completely perfect and is therefore superior to the path of fruitive activities and the path of knowledge. Quoting from the Vedas, \u015ar\u012bla V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya explains that austerity involves observing fasts as fully as possible (tapas\u0101n\u0101\u015bakena). \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b has also advised that aty\u0101h\u0101ra, too much eating, is an impediment to advancement in spiritual life. Also, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.17) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cHe who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.\u201d In text 14 the word dh\u012br\u0101\u1e25, meaning \u201cthose who are undisturbed under all circumstances,\u201d is very significant. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14): \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\u201d In material life there are many disturbances (adhy\u0101tmika, adhidaivika and adhibhautika). One who has learned to tolerate these disturbances under all circumstances is called dh\u012bra."

        "translation": "Only a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can uproot the weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will revive. He can do this simply by discharging devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays.",
        "purport": " In the previous verse \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b gave the example that the dried leaves of creepers beneath a bamboo tree may be completely burnt to ashes by a fire, although the creepers may sprout again because the root is still in the ground. Similarly, because the root of sinful desire is not destroyed in the heart of a person who is cultivating knowledge but who has no taste for devotional service, there is a possibility that his sinful desires will reappear. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.4): Speculators who undergo great labor to gain a meticulous understanding of the material world by distinguishing between sinful and pious activities, but who are not situated in devotional service, are prone to material activities. They may fall down and become implicated in fruitive activities. If one becomes attached to devotional service, however, his desires for material enjoyment are automatically vanquished without separate endeavor. Bhakti\u1e25 pare\u015b\u0101nubhavo viraktir anyatra ca: if one is advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, material activities, both sinful and pious, automatically become distasteful to him. That is the test of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Both pious and impious activities are actually due to ignorance because a living entity, as an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has no need to act for his personal sense gratification. Therefore as soon as one is reclaimed to the platform of devotional service, he relinquishes his attachment for pious and impious activities and is interested only in what will satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This process of bhakti, devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (v\u0101sudeva-par\u0101ya\u1e47a), relieves one from the reactions of all activities. Since Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it was a great devotee. the answers of his guru, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, concerning karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da and j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da could not satisfy him. Therefore \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, knowing very well the heart of his disciple, explained the transcendental bliss of devotional service. The word kecit, which is used in this verse, means. \u201ca few people but not all.\u201d Not everyone can become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.3): \u201cOut of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.\u201d Practically no one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be understood through pious activities or attainment of the most elevated speculative knowledge. Actually the highest knowledge consists of understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Unintelligent men who do not understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are grossly puffed up, thinking that they are liberated or have themselves become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. This is ignorance. To indicate the purity of bhakti, devotional service, \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.1.11): \u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b further explains that bhakti is kle\u015baghn\u012b \u015bubhad\u0101, which means if one takes to devotional service, all kinds of unnecessary labor and material distress cease entirely and one achieves all good fortune. Bhakti is so powerful that it is also said to be mok\u1e63a-laghut\u0101k\u1e5bt; in other words, it minimizes the importance of liberation. Nondevotees must undergo material hardships because they are prone to commit sinful fruitive activities. The desire to commit sinful actions continues in their hearts due to ignorance. These sinful actions are divided into three categories \u2014 p\u0101taka, mah\u0101-p\u0101taka and atip\u0101taka \u2014 and also into two divisions; pr\u0101rabdha and apr\u0101rabdha. Pr\u0101rabdha refers to sinful reactions from which one is suffering at the present, and apr\u0101rabdha refers to sources of potential suffering. When the seeds (b\u012bja) of sinful reactions have not yet fructified, the reactions are called apr\u0101rabdha. These seeds of sinful action are unseen, but they are unlimited, and no one can trace when they were first planted. Because of pr\u0101rabdha, sinful reactions that have already fructified, one is seen to have taken birth in a low family or to be suffering from other miseries. When one takes to devotional service, however, all phases of sinful life, including pr\u0101rabdha, apr\u0101rabdha and b\u012bja, are vanquished. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.14.19) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Uddhava: \u201cMy dear Uddhava, devotional service in relationship with Me is like a blazing fire that can burn to ashes all the fuel of sinful activities supplied to it.\u201d How devotional service vanquishes the reactions of sinful life is explained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.33.6) in a verse spoken during Lord Kapiladeva\u2019s instructions to His mother, Devah\u016bti. Devah\u016bti said: \u201cMy dear Lord, if even a person born in a family of dog-eaters hears and repeats the chanting of Your glories, offers respects to You and remembers You, he is immediately greater than a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and is therefore eligible to perform sacrifices. Therefore, what is to be said of one who has seen You directly?\u201d In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a there is a statement that persons whose hearts are always attached to the devotional service of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are immediately released from all the reactions of sinful life. These reactions generally exist in four phases. Some of them are ready to produce results immediately, some are in the form of seeds, some are unmanifested, and some are current. All such reactions are immediately nullified by devotional service. When devotional service is present in one\u2019s heart, desires to perform sinful activities have no place there. Sinful life is due to ignorance, which means forgetfulness of one\u2019s constitutional position as an eternal servant of God, but when one is fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious he realizes that he is God\u2019s eternal servant. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b comments that bhakti may be divided into two divisions: (1) santat\u0101, devotional service that continues incessantly with faith and love, and (2) k\u0101d\u0101citk\u012b, devotional service that does not continue incessantly but is sometimes awakened. Incessantly flowing devotional service (santat\u0101) may also be divided into two categories: (1) service performed with slight attachment and (2) spontaneous devotional service. Intermittent devotional service (k\u0101d\u0101citk\u012b) may be divided into three categories: (1) r\u0101g\u0101bh\u0101samay\u012b, devotional service in which one is almost attached, (2) r\u0101g\u0101bh\u0101sa-\u015b\u016bnya-svar\u016bpa-bh\u016bt\u0101, devotional service in which there is no spontaneous love but one likes the constitutional position of serving, and (3) \u0101bh\u0101sa-r\u016bp\u0101, a slight glimpse of devotional service. As for atonement, if one has caught even a slight glimpse of devotional service, all needs to undergo pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta, atonement, are superseded. Therefore atonement is certainly unnecessary when one has achieved spontaneous love and, above that, attachment with love, which are signs of increasing advancement in k\u0101d\u0101citk\u012b. Even in the stage of \u0101bh\u0101sa-r\u016bp\u0101 bhakti, all the reactions of sinful life are uprooted and vanquished. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b expresses the opinion that the word k\u0101rtsnyena means that even if one has a desire to commit sinful actions, the roots of that desire are vanquished merely by \u0101bh\u0101sa-r\u016bp\u0101 bhakti. The example of bh\u0101skara, the sun, is most appropriate. The \u0101bh\u0101sa feature of bhakti is compared to dawn, and the accumulation of one\u2019s sinful activities is compared to fog. Since fog does not spread throughout the sky, the sun need do no more than merely manifest its first rays, and the fog immediately disappears. Similarly, if one has even a slight relationship with devotional service, all the fog of his sinful life is immediately vanquished."

        "translation": "My dear King, if a sinful person engages in the service of a bona fide devotee of the Lord and thus learns how to dedicate his life unto the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can be completely purified. One cannot be purified merely by undergoing austerity, penance, brahmacarya and the other methods of atonement I have previously described.",
        "purport": " Tat-puru\u1e63a refers to a preacher of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, such as the spiritual master. \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has said, ch\u0101\u1e0diy\u0101 vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-sev\u0101 nist\u0101ra p\u0101yeche keb\u0101: \u201cWithout serving a bona fide spiritual master, an ideal Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, who can be delivered from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101?\u201d This idea is also expressed in many other places. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.2) says, mahat-sev\u0101\u1e41 dv\u0101ram \u0101hur vimukte\u1e25: if one desires liberation from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, one must associate with a pure devotee mah\u0101tm\u0101. A mah\u0101tm\u0101 is one who engages twenty-four hours daily in the loving service of the Lord. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.13): \u201cO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.\u201d Thus the symptom of a mah\u0101tm\u0101 is that he has no engagement other than service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One must render service to a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava in order to get freed from sinful reactions, revive one\u2019s original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and be trained in how to love K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the result of mah\u0101tma-sev\u0101. Of course, if one engages in the service of a pure devotee, the reactions of one\u2019s sinful life are vanquished automatically. Devotional service is necessary not to drive away an insignificant stock of sins, but to awaken our dormant love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As fog is vanquished at the first glimpse of sunlight, one\u2019s sinful reactions are automatically vanquished as soon as one begins serving a pure devotee; no separate endeavor is required. The word k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-arpita-pr\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 refers to a devotee who dedicates his life to serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not to being saved from the path to hellish life. A devotee is n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101ya\u1e47a, or v\u0101sudeva-par\u0101ya\u1e47a, which means that the path of V\u0101sudeva, or the devotional path, is his life and soul. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101\u1e25 sarve na kuta\u015bcana bibhyati (Bh\u0101g. 6.17.28): such a devotee is not afraid of going anywhere. There is a path toward liberation in the higher planetary systems and a path toward the hellish planets, but a n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-para devotee is unafraid wherever he is sent; he simply wants to remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, wherever he may be. Such a devotee is unconcerned with hell and heaven; he is simply attached to rendering service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When a devotee is put into hellish conditions, he accepts them as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy: tat te\u00a0\u2019nukamp\u0101\u1e41 susam\u012bk\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.8). He does not protest, \u201cOh, I am such a great devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Why have I been put into this misery?\u201d Instead he thinks, \u201cThis is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy.\u201d Such an attitude is possible for a devotee who engages in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s representative. This is the secret of success."

M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs may be su\u015b\u012bl\u0101\u1e25 s\u0101dhava\u1e25 (well-behaved saintly persons), but there is nevertheless some doubt about whether they are actually making progress, for they have not accepted the path of bhakti. On the other hand, those who follow the path of the \u0101c\u0101ryas are su\u015b\u012bl\u0101\u1e25 and s\u0101dhava\u1e25, but furthermore their path is akuto-bhaya, which means free from fear. One should fearlessly follow the twelve mah\u0101janas and their line of disciplic succession and thus be liberated from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101."

Even in dreams, such surrendered souls do not see Yamar\u0101ja or his order carriers, who are equipped with ropes to bind the sinful.",
        "purport": " K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\u201d This same principle is described here (sak\u1e5bn mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25). If by studying Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 one decides to surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is immediately freed from all sinful reactions. It is also significant that \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, having several times repeated the words v\u0101sudeva-par\u0101ya\u1e47a and n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101ya\u1e47a, finally says k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25. Thus he indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of both N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and V\u0101sudeva. Even though N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and V\u0101sudeva are not different from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, simply by surrendering to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one fully surrenders to all His expansions, such as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva and Govinda. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.7), matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat: \u201cThere is no truth superior to Me.\u201d There are many names and forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme form (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam). Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends to neophyte devotees that one should surrender unto Him only (m\u0101m ekam). Because neophyte devotees cannot understand what the forms of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva and Govinda are, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly says, m\u0101m ekam. Herein, this is also supported by the word k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a does not speak personally, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or V\u0101sudeva, does, as in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 for example. Therefore, to follow the direction of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 means to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and to surrender in this way is the highest perfection of bhakti-yoga. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had inquired from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b how one can be saved from falling into the various conditions of hellish life. In this verse \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b answers that a soul who has surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a certainly cannot go to naraka, hellish existence. To say nothing of going there, even in his dreams he does not see Yamar\u0101ja or his order carriers, who are able to take one there. In other words, if one wants to save himself from falling into naraka, hellish life, he should fully surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The word sak\u1e5bt is significant because it indicates that if one sincerely surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once, he is saved even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful activities. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.30): \u201cEven if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.\u201d If one never for a moment forgets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is safe even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful acts. In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.40) the Lord also says: \u201cIn this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.\u201d Elsewhere in the G\u012bt\u0101 (6.40) the Lord says, na hi kaly\u0101\u1e47a-k\u1e5bt ka\u015bcid durgati\u1e41 t\u0101ta gacchati: \u201cone who performs auspicious activity is never overcome by evil.\u201d The highest kaly\u0101\u1e47a (auspicious) activity is to surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the only path by which to save oneself from falling down into hellish life. \u015ar\u012bla Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b has confirmed this as follows: The sinful actions of one who has surrendered unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are compared to a snake with its poison fangs removed (protkh\u0101ta-da\u1e41\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101yate). Such a snake is no longer to be feared. Of course, one should not commit sinful activities on the strength of having surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. However, even if one who has surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a happens to do something sinful because of his former habits, such sinful actions no longer have a destructive effect. Therefore one should adhere to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very tightly and serve Him under the direction of the spiritual master. Thus in all conditions one will be akuto-bhaya, free from fear."

        "translation": "In the city known as K\u0101nyakubja there was a br\u0101hma\u1e47a named Aj\u0101mila who married a prostitute maidservant and lost all his brahminical qualities because of the association of that low-class woman.",
        "purport": " The fault of illicit connection with women is that it makes one lose all brahminical qualities. In India there is still a class of servants, called \u015b\u016bdras, whose maidservant wives are called \u015b\u016bdr\u0101\u1e47\u012bs. Sometimes people who are very lusty establish relationships with such maidservants and sweeping women, since in the higher statuses of society they cannot indulge in the habit of woman hunting, which is strictly prohibited by social convention. Aj\u0101mila, a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a youth, lost all his brahminical qualities because of his association with a prostitute, but he was ultimately saved because he had begun the process of bhakti-yoga. Therefore in the previous verse, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b spoke of the person who has only once surrendered himself at the lotus feet of the Lord (mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25) or has just begun the bhakti-yoga process. Bhakti-yoga begins with \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, hearing and chanting of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s names, as in the mah\u0101-mantra \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Chanting is the beginning of bhakti-yoga. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu declares: \u201cIn this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.\u201d The process of chanting the holy name of the Lord is always superbly effective, but it is especially effective in this Age of Kali. Its practical effectiveness will now be explained by \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b through the history of Aj\u0101mila, who was freed from the hands of the Yamad\u016btas simply because of chanting the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s original question was how to be freed from falling down into hell or into the hands of the Yamad\u016btas. In reply, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b is citing this old historical example to convince Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of the potency of bhakti-yoga, which begins simply with the chanting of the Lord\u2019s name. All the great authorities of bhakti-yoga recommend the devotional process beginning with the chanting of the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (tan-n\u0101ma-graha\u1e47\u0101dibhi\u1e25)."

The more society allows prostitution and illicit sex, the more impetus it gives to cheaters, thieves, plunderers, drunkards and gamblers. Therefore we first advise all the disciples in our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement to avoid illicit sex, which is the beginning of all abominable life and which is followed by meat-eating, gambling and intoxication, one after another. Of course, restraint is very difficult, but it is quite possible if one fully surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, since all these abominable habits gradually become distasteful for a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. If illicit sex is allowed to increase in a society, however, the entire society will be condemned, for it will be full of rogues, thieves, cheaters and so forth."

        "purport": " In the Second Canto of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.1.6) \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says: \u201cThe highest perfection of human life, achieved either by complete knowledge of matter and spirit, by acquirement of mystic powers, or by perfect discharge of one\u2019s occupational duty, is to remember the Personality of Godhead at the end of life.\u201d Somehow or other, Aj\u0101mila consciously or unconsciously chanted the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a at the time of death (ante n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-sm\u1e5bti\u1e25), and therefore he became all-perfect simply by concentrating his mind on the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. It may also be concluded that Aj\u0101mila, who was the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, was accustomed to worshiping N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in his youth because in every br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s house there is worship of the n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-\u015bil\u0101. This system is still present in India; in a rigid br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s house, there is n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-sev\u0101, worship of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Therefore, although the contaminated Aj\u0101mila was calling for his son, by concentrating his mind on the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a he remembered the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a he had very faithfully worshiped in his youth. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b expressed his verdict as follows: etac ca tad-upal\u0101lan\u0101di-\u015br\u012b-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-namocc\u0101ra\u1e47a-m\u0101h\u0101tmyena tad-bhaktir ev\u0101bh\u016bd iti siddh\u0101ntopayogitven\u0101pi dra\u1e63\u1e6davyam. \u201cAccording to the bhaktisiddh\u0101nta, it is to be analyzed that because Aj\u0101mila constantly chanted his son\u2019s name, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, he was elevated to the platform of bhakti, although he did not know it.\u201d Similarly, \u015ar\u012bla V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya gives this opinion: eva\u1e41 vartam\u0101na\u1e25 sa dvija\u1e25 m\u1e5btyu-k\u0101le upasthite satyaj\u00f1o n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101khye putra eva mati\u1e41 cak\u0101ra matim \u0101sakt\u0101m akarod ity artha\u1e25. \u201cAlthough at the time of death he was chanting the name of his son, he nevertheless concentrated his mind upon the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.\u201d \u015ar\u012bla Vijayadhvaja T\u012brtha gives a similar opinion: m\u1e5btyu-k\u0101le deha-viyoga-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-k\u0101le m\u1e5btyo\u1e25 sarva-do\u1e63a-p\u0101pa-harasya harer anugrah\u0101t k\u0101le datta-j\u00f1\u0101na-lak\u1e63a\u1e47e upasthite h\u1e5bdi prak\u0101\u015bite tanaye p\u016br\u1e47a-j\u00f1\u0101ne b\u0101le pa\u00f1ca-var\u1e63a-kalpe pr\u0101de\u015ba-m\u0101tre n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101hvaye m\u016brti-vi\u015be\u1e63e mati\u1e41 smara\u1e47a-samartha\u1e41 citta\u1e41 cak\u0101ra bhakty\u0101smarad ity artha\u1e25.

Materialistic scientists do not know where to find the soul within the body with their material instruments, but this verse clearly explains that the soul is within the core of the heart (h\u1e5bdaya); it is from the heart that the Yamad\u016btas were extracting the soul of Aj\u0101mila. Similarly, we learn that the Supersoul, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is also situated within the heart (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be\u00a0\u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati). In the Upani\u1e63ads it is said that the Supersoul and the individual soul are living in the same tree of the body as two friendly birds. The Supersoul is said to be friendly because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so kind to the original soul that when the original soul transmigrates from one body to another, the Lord goes with him. Furthermore, according to the desire and karma of the individual soul, the Lord, through the agency of m\u0101y\u0101, creates another body for him. The heart of the body is a mechanical arrangement. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61): \u201cThe Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.\u201d Yantra means a machine, such as an automobile. The driver of the machine of the body is the individual soul, who is also its director or proprietor, but the supreme proprietor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One\u2019s body is created through the agency of m\u0101y\u0101 (karma\u1e47\u0101 daiva-netre\u1e47a), and according to one\u2019s activities in this life, another vehicle is created, again under the supervision of daiv\u012b m\u0101y\u0101 (daiv\u012b hy e\u1e63\u0101 gu\u1e47a-may\u012b mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101). At the appropriate time, one\u2019s next body is immediately chosen, and both the individual soul and the Supersoul transfer to that particular bodily machine. This is the process of transmigration. During transmigration from one body to the next, the soul is taken away by the order carriers of Yamar\u0101ja and put into a particular type of hellish life (naraka) in order to become accustomed to the condition in which he will live in his next body."

        "purport": " The most significant word used in this verse is siddha-sattam\u0101\u1e25, which means \u201cthe best of the perfect.\u201d In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.3) it is said, manu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 sahasre\u1e63u ka\u015bcid yatati siddhaye: out of millions of persons, one may try to become siddha, perfect \u2014 or, in other words, self-realized. A self-realized person knows that he is not the body but a spiritual soul (aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi). At the present moment practically everyone is unaware of this fact, but one who understands this has attained perfection and is therefore called siddha. When one understands that the soul is part and parcel of the supreme soul and one thus engages in the devotional service of the supreme soul, one becomes siddha-sattama. One is then eligible to live in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. The word siddha-sattama, therefore, refers to a liberated, pure devotee. Since the Yamad\u016btas are servants of Yamar\u0101ja, who is also one of the siddha-sattamas, they knew that a siddha-sattama is above the demigods and sub-demigods and, indeed, above all the living entities within this material world. The Yamad\u016btas therefore inquired why the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas were present where a sinful man was going to die. It should also be noted that Aj\u0101mila was not yet dead, for the Yamad\u016btas were trying to snatch the soul from his heart. They could not take the soul, however, and therefore Aj\u0101mila was not yet dead. This will be revealed in later verses. Aj\u0101mila was simply in an unconscious state when the argument was in progress between the Yamad\u016btas and the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas. The conclusion of the argument was to be a decision regarding who would claim the soul of Aj\u0101mila."

Therefore when the Yamad\u016btas saw the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas for the first time, they were surprised. They said, \u201cBy your bodily features you appear to be very exalted gentlemen, and you have such celestial power that you have dissipated the darkness of this material world with your own effulgences. Why then should you endeavor to stop us from executing our duty?\u201d It will be explained that the Yamad\u016btas, the order carriers of Yamar\u0101ja, mistakenly considered Aj\u0101mila sinful. They did not know that although he was sinful throughout his entire life, he was purified by constantly chanting the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. In other words, unless one is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, one cannot understand the activities of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. The dress and bodily features of the residents of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka are properly described in these verses. The residents of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, who are decorated with garlands and yellow silken garments, have four arms holding various weapons. Thus they conspicuously resemble Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. They have the same bodily features as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a because they have attained the liberation of s\u0101r\u016bpya, but they nevertheless act as servants. All the residents of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka know perfectly well that their master is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that they are all His servants. They are all self-realized souls who are nitya-mukta, everlastingly liberated. Although they could conceivably declare themselves N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, they never do so; they always remain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and serve the Lord faithfully. Such is the atmosphere of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. Similarly, one who learns the faithful service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement will always remain in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka and have nothing to do with the material world."

The servants of Yamar\u0101ja claimed to be carrying out his orders, and therefore the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas very intelligently asked them to explain the symptoms of religious and irreligious principles. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava knows these principles perfectly well because he is well acquainted with the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord says, sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: \u201cGive up all other varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.\u201d Therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the actual principle of religion. Those who have surrendered to the principles of material nature instead of to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are all impious, regardless of their material position. Unaware of the principles of religion, they do not surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore they are considered sinful rascals, the lowest of men, and fools bereft of all knowledge. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.15): \u201cThose miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.\u201d One who has not surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not know the true principle of religion; otherwise he would have surrendered. The question posed by the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas was very suitable. One who represents someone else must fully know that person\u2019s mission. The devotees in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement must therefore be fully aware of the mission of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Lord Caitanya; otherwise they will be considered foolish. All devotees, especially preachers, must know the philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so as not to be embarrassed and insulted when they preach."

        "purport": " The servants of Yamar\u0101ja replied quite properly. They did not manufacture principles of religion or irreligion. Instead, they explained what they had heard from the authority Yamar\u0101ja. Mah\u0101jano yena gata\u1e25 sa panth\u0101\u1e25: one should follow the mah\u0101jana, the authorized person. Yamar\u0101ja is one of twelve authorities. Therefore the servants of Yamar\u0101ja, the Yamad\u016btas, replied with perfect clarity when they said \u015bu\u015bruma (\u201cwe have heard\u201d). The members of modern civilization manufacture defective religious principles through speculative concoction. This is not dharma. They do not know what is dharma and what is adharma. Therefore, as stated in the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, dharma\u1e25 projjhita-kaitavo\u00a0\u2019tra: dharma not supported by the Vedas is rejected from \u015br\u012bmad-bh\u0101gavata-dharma. Bh\u0101gavata-dharma comprises only that which is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bh\u0101gavata-dharma is sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: one must accept the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender to Him and whatever He says. That is dharma. Arjuna, for example, thinking that violence was adharma, was declining to fight, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a urged him to fight. Arjuna abided by the orders of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore he is actually a dharm\u012b because the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is dharma. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: \u201cThe real purpose of veda, knowledge, is to know Me.\u201d One who knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a perfectly is liberated. As K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d One who understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and abides by His order is a candidate for returning home, back to Godhead. It may be concluded that dharma, religion, refers to that which is ordered in the Vedas, and adharma, irreligion, refers to that which is not supported in the Vedas. Dharma is not actually manufactured by N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. As stated in the Vedas, asya mahato bh\u016btasya ni\u015bvasitam etad yad \u1e5bg-veda\u1e25 iti: the injunctions of dharma emanate from the breathing of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the supreme living entity. N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a exists eternally and breathes eternally, and therefore dharma, the injunctions of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, also exist eternally. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, the original \u0101c\u0101rya for those who belong to the M\u0101dhva-Gau\u1e0d\u012bya samprad\u0101ya, says: The transcendental words of the Vedas emanated from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Vedic principles should be understood to be Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava principles because Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the origin of the Vedas. The Vedas contain nothing besides the instructions of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and one who follows the Vedic principles is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is not a member of a manufactured community of this material world. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is a real knower of the Vedas, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25)."

As stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.1): \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes.\u201d"

We once had a discussion with a learned Christian professor who argued that although people are generally punished after the witnesses of their misdeeds are examined, where are the witnesses responsible for one\u2019s suffering the reactions of past karma? To such a person the answer by the Yamad\u016btas is given here. A conditioned soul thinks that he is working stealthily and that no one can see his sinful activities, but we can understand from the \u015b\u0101stras that there are many witnesses, including the sun, fire, sky, air, moon, demigods, evening, day, night, directions, water, land and the Supersoul Himself, who sits with the individual soul within his heart. Where is the dearth of witnesses? The witnesses and the Supreme Lord both exist, and therefore so many living entities are elevated to higher planetary systems or degraded to lower planetary systems, including the hellish planets. There are no discrepancies, for everything is arranged perfectly by the management of the Supreme God (sv\u0101bh\u0101vik\u012b j\u00f1\u0101na-bala-kriy\u0101 ca).

        "purport": " A man engages in sinful activities because he does not know what he did in his past life to get his present materially conditioned body, which is subjected to the threefold miseries. As stated by \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.4), n\u016bna\u1e41 pramatta\u1e25 kurute vikarma: a human being who is mad after sense gratification does not hesitate to act sinfully. Yad indriya-pr\u012btaya \u0101p\u1e5b\u1e47oti: he performs sinful actions simply for sense gratification. Na s\u0101dhu manye: this is not good. Yata \u0101tmano\u00a0\u2019yam asann api kle\u015bada \u0101sa deha\u1e25: because of such sinful actions, one receives another body in which to suffer as he is suffering in his present body because of his past sinful activities. It should be understood that a person who does not have Vedic knowledge always acts in ignorance of what he has done in the past, what he is doing at the present and how he will suffer in the future. He is completely in darkness. Therefore the Vedic injunction is, tamasi m\u0101: \u201cDon\u2019t remain in darkness.\u201d Jyotir gama: \u201cTry to go to the light.\u201d The light or illumination is Vedic knowledge, which one can understand when he is elevated to the mode of goodness or when he transcends the mode of goodness by engaging in devotional service to the spiritual master and the Supreme Lord. This is described in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (6.23): \u201cUnto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed.\u201d The Vedas enjoin, tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet: one must approach a spiritual master who has full knowledge of the Vedas and be faithfully directed by him in order to become a devotee of the Lord. Then the knowledge of the Vedas will be revealed. When the Vedic knowledge is revealed, one need no longer remain in the darkness of material nature. According to his association with the material modes of nature \u2014 goodness, passion and ignorance \u2014 a living entity gets a particular type of body. The example of one who associates with the mode of goodness is a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Such a br\u0101hma\u1e47a knows past, present and future because he consults the Vedic literature and sees through the eyes of \u015b\u0101stra (\u015b\u0101stra-cak\u1e63u\u1e25). He can understand what his past life was, why be is in the present body, and how he can obtain liberation from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 and not accept another material body. This is all possible when one is situated in the mode of goodness. Generally, however, the living entities are engrossed in the modes of passion and ignorance. In any case, one receives an inferior or superior body at the discretion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param\u0101tm\u0101. As stated in the previous verse: Everything depends on bhagav\u0101n, or aja\u1e25, the unborn. Why doesn\u2019t one please Bhagav\u0101n to receive a better body? The answer is aj\u00f1as tamas\u0101: because of gross ignorance. One who is in complete darkness cannot know what his past life was or what his next life will be; he is simply interested in his present body. Even though he has a human body, a person in the mode of ignorance and interested only in his present body is like an animal, for an animal, being covered by ignorance, thinks that the ultimate goal of life and happiness is to eat as much as possible. A human being must be educated to understand his past life and how he can endeavor for a better life in the future. There is even a book, called Bh\u1e5bgu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, which reveals information about one\u2019s past, present and future lives according to astrological calculations. Somehow or other one must be enlightened about his past, present and future. One who is interested only in his present body and who tries to enjoy his senses to the fullest extent is understood to be engrossed in the mode of ignorance. His future is very, very dark. Indeed, the future is always dark for one who is grossly covered by ignorance. Especially in this age, human society is covered by the mode of ignorance, and therefore everyone thinks his present body to be everything, without consideration of the past or future."

One tries to enjoy the five sense objects, namely form, sound, taste, aroma and touch, not knowing the actual goal of life, which is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. Because of disobeying the Supreme Lord, one is put into material conditions, and he then tries to improve his situation in a concocted way, not desiring to follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nevertheless, the Supreme Lord is so kind that He comes Himself to instruct the bewildered living entity how to act obediently and then gradually return home, back to Godhead, where he can attain an eternal, peaceful life of bliss and knowledge. The living entity has a body, which is a very complicated combination of the material elements, and with this body he struggles alone, as indicated in this verse by the words ekas tu. For example, if one is struggling in the ocean, he must swim through it alone. Although many other men and aquatics are swimming in the ocean, he must take care of himself because no one else will help him. Therefore this verse indicates that the seventeenth item, the soul, must work alone. Although he tries to create society, friendship and love, no one will be able to help him but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord. Therefore his only concern should be how to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is also what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). People bewildered by material conditions try to be united, but although they strive for unity among men and nations, all their attempts are futile. Everyone must struggle alone for existence with the many elements of nature. Therefore one\u2019s only hope, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises, is to surrender to Him, for He can help one become free from the ocean of nescience. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore prayed: \u201cO K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, beloved son of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, I am Your eternal servant, but somehow or other I have fallen into this ocean of nescience, and although I am struggling very hard, there is no way I can save myself. If You kindly pick me up and fix me as one of the particles of dust at Your lotus feet, that will save me.\u201d In a similar way, Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura sang: \u201cMy dear Lord, I cannot remember when I somehow or other fell into this ocean of nescience, and now I can find no way to rescue myself.\u201d We should remember that everyone is responsible for his own life. If an individual becomes a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is then delivered from the ocean of nescience."

        "purport": " The sv\u0101bh\u0101vika, or one\u2019s natural tendency, is the most important factor in action. One\u2019s natural tendency is to serve because a living entity is an eternal servant of God. The living entity wants to serve, but because of his forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord, he serves under the modes of material nature and manufactures various modes of service, such as socialism, humanitarianism and altruism. However, one should be enlightened in the tenets of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and accept the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that one give up all natural tendencies for material service under different names and take to the service of the Lord. One\u2019s original natural tendency is to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because one\u2019s real nature is spiritual. The duty of a human being is to understand that since he is essentially spirit, he must abide by the spiritual tendency and not be carried away by material tendencies. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has therefore sung: \u201cMy dear brothers, you are being carried away by the waves of material energy and are suffering in many miserable conditions. Sometimes you are drowning in the waves of material nature, and sometimes you are tossed like a swimmer struggling in the ocean.\u201d As confirmed by Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura, this tendency to be battered by the waves of m\u0101y\u0101 can be changed to one\u2019s original, natural tendency, which is spiritual, when the living entity comes to understand that he is eternally k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-d\u0101sa, a servant of God, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If instead of serving m\u0101y\u0101 under different names, one turns his service attitude toward the Supreme Lord, he is then safe, and there is no more difficulty. If one returns to his original, natural tendency in the human form of life by understanding the perfect knowledge given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in the Vedic literature, one\u2019s life is successful."

        "translation": "The fruitive activities a living being performs, whether pious or impious, are the unseen cause for the fulfillment of his desires. This unseen cause is the root for the living entity\u2019s different bodies. Because of his intense desire, the living entity takes birth in a particular family and receives a body which is either like that of his mother or like that of his father. The gross and subtle bodies are created according to his desire.",
        "purport": " The gross body is a product of the subtle body. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.6): \u201cWhatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.\u201d The atmosphere of the subtle body at the time of death is created by the activities of the gross body. Thus the gross body acts during one\u2019s lifetime, and the subtle body acts at the time of death. The subtle body, which is called li\u1e45ga, the body of desire, is the background for the development of a particular type of gross body, which is either like that of one\u2019s mother or like that of one\u2019s father. According to the \u1e5ag Veda, if at the time of sex the secretions of the mother are more profuse than those of the father, the child will receive a female body, and if the secretions of the father are more profuse than those of the mother, the child will receive a male body. These are the subtle laws of nature, which act according to the desire of the living entity. If a human being is taught to change his subtle body by developing a consciousness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, at the time of death the subtle body will create a gross body in which he will be a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or if he is still more perfect, he will not take another material body but will immediately get a spiritual body and thus return home, back to Godhead. This is the process of the transmigration of the soul. Therefore instead of trying to unite human society through pacts for sense gratification that can never be achieved, it is clearly desirable to teach people how to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and return home, back to Godhead. This is true now and, indeed, at any time."

As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9), janma karma ca me divyam eva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25: one must simply understand the Supreme Person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in terms of His form, name, activities and pastimes.

On the way home, he came upon a \u015b\u016bdra, a very lusty, fourth-class man, who was shamelessly embracing and kissing a prostitute. The \u015b\u016bdra was smiling, singing and enjoying as if this were proper behavior. Both the \u015b\u016bdra and the prostitute were drunk. The prostitute\u2019s eyes were rolling in intoxication, and her dress had become loose. Such was the condition in which Aj\u0101mila saw them.",
        "purport": " While traveling along the public way, Aj\u0101mila came upon a fourth-class man and a prostitute, who are vividly described here. Drunkenness was sometimes manifest even in bygone ages, although not very frequently. In this Age of Kali, however, such sin is to be seen everywhere, for people all over the world have become shameless. Long ago, when he saw the scene of the drunken \u015b\u016bdra and the prostitute, Aj\u0101mila, who was a perfect brahmac\u0101r\u012b, was affected. Nowadays such sin is visible in so many places, and we must consider the position of a brahmac\u0101r\u012b student who sees such behavior. For such a brahmac\u0101r\u012b to remain steady is very difficult unless he is extremely strong in following the regulative principles. Nevertheless, if one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness very seriously, he can withstand the provocation created by sin. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement we prohibit illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. In Kali-yuga, a drunk, half-naked woman embracing a drunk man is a very common sight, especially in the Western countries, and restraining oneself after seeing such things is very difficult. Nevertheless, if by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one adheres to the regulative principles and chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will certainly protect him. Indeed, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that His devotee is never vanquished (kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati). Therefore all the disciples practicing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should obediently follow the regulative principles and remain fixed in chanting the holy name of the Lord. Then there need be no fear. Otherwise one\u2019s position is very dangerous, especially in this Kali-yuga."
