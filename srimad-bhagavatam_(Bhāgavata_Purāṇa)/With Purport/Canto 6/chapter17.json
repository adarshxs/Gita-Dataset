For P\u0101rvat\u012b to be embraced by Lord \u015aiva was natural in a relationship between husband and wife; this was nothing extraordinary for Citraketu to see. Nonetheless, Citraketu laughed loudly to see Lord \u015aiva in that situation, even though he should not have done so. Thus he was eventually cursed, and this curse was the cause of his returning home, back to Godhead."

        "purport": " Citraketu\u2019s purpose in criticizing Lord \u015aiva is somewhat mysterious and cannot be understood by a common man. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, however, has made the following observations. Lord \u015aiva, being the most exalted Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and one of the most powerful demigods, is able to do anything he desires. Although he was externally exhibiting the behavior of a common man and not following etiquette, such actions cannot diminish his exalted position. The difficulty is that a common man, seeing Lord \u015aiva\u2019s behavior, might follow his example. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.21): \u201cWhatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.\u201d A common man might also criticize Lord \u015aiva, like Dak\u1e63a, who suffered the consequences for his criticism. King Citraketu desired that Lord \u015aiva cease this external behavior so that others might be saved from criticizing him and thus becoming offenders. If one thinks that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the only perfect personality whereas the demigods, even such demigods as Lord \u015aiva, are inclined to improper social affairs, he is an offender. Considering all this, King Citraketu was somewhat harsh in his behavior with Lord \u015aiva. Lord \u015aiva, who is always deep in knowledge, could understand Citraketu\u2019s purpose, and therefore he was not at all angry; rather, he simply smiled and remained silent. The members of the assembly surrounding Lord \u015aiva could also understand Citraketu\u2019s purpose. Consequently, following the behavior of Lord \u015aiva, they did not protest; instead, following their master, they remained silent. If the members of the assembly thought that Citraketu had blasphemed Lord \u015aiva, they would certainly have left at once, blocking their ears with their hands."

        "translation": "O impudent one, my dear son, now take birth in a low, sinful family of demons so that you will not commit such an offense again toward exalted, saintly persons in this world.",
        "purport": " One should be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, of whom Lord \u015aiva is the best. While instructing \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu described an offense at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava as h\u0101t\u012b m\u0101t\u0101, a mad elephant. When a mad elephant enters a nice garden, it spoils the entire garden. Similarly, if one becomes like a mad elephant and commits offenses at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, his entire spiritual career is halted. One should therefore be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Mother P\u0101rvat\u012b was justified in punishing Citraketu, for Citraketu impudently criticized the supreme father, Mah\u0101deva, who is the father of the living entities conditioned within this material world. The goddess Durg\u0101 is called mother, and Lord \u015aiva is called father. A pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should be very careful to engage in his specific duty without criticizing others. This is the safest position. Otherwise, if one tends to criticize others, he may commit the great offense of criticizing a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Because Citraketu was undoubtedly a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he might have been surprised that P\u0101rvat\u012b had cursed him. Therefore the goddess P\u0101rvat\u012b addressed him as putra, or son. Everyone is the son of mother Durg\u0101, but she is not an ordinary mother. As soon as there is a small discrepancy in a demon\u2019s behavior, mother Durg\u0101 immediately punishes the demon so that he may come to his senses. This is explained by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): \u201cThis divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.\u201d To surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a means to surrender to His devotees also, for no one can be a proper servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a unless he is a proper servant of a devotee. Ch\u0101\u1e0diy\u0101 vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-sev\u0101 nist\u0101ra p\u0101yeche keb\u0101: without serving a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot be elevated to being a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Therefore mother P\u0101rvat\u012b spoke to Citraketu exactly like a mother who says to her naughty child, \u201cMy dear child, I am punishing you so that you won\u2019t do anything like this again.\u201d This tendency of a mother to punish her child is found even in mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, who became the mother of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 punished K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by binding Him and showing Him a stick. Thus it is the duty of a mother to chastise her beloved son, even in the case of the Supreme Lord. It is to be understood that mother Durg\u0101 was justified in punishing Citraketu. This punishment was a boon to Citraketu because after taking birth as the demon V\u1e5btr\u0101sura, he was promoted directly to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha."

        "purport": " Since Citraketu was a devotee of the Lord, he was not at all disturbed by the curse of mother P\u0101rvat\u012b. He knew very well that one suffers or enjoys the results of one\u2019s past deeds as ordained by daiva-netra \u2014 superior authority, or the agents of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He knew that he had not committed any offense at the lotus feet of Lord \u015aiva or the goddess P\u0101rvat\u012b, yet he had been punished, and this means that the punishment had been ordained. Thus the King did not mind it. A devotee is naturally so humble and meek that he accepts any condition of life as a blessing from the Lord. Tat te\u00a0\u2019nukamp\u0101\u1e41 susam\u012bk\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 (Bh\u0101g. 10.14.8). A devotee always accepts punishment from anyone as the mercy of the Lord. If one lives in this conception of life, he sees whatever reverses occur to be due to his past misdeeds, and therefore he never accuses anyone. On the contrary, he becomes increasingly attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because of his being purified by his suffering. Suffering, therefore, is also a process of purification. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says in this connection that one who has developed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and who exists in love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is no longer subject to suffering and happiness under the laws of karma. Indeed, he is beyond karma. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 says, karm\u0101\u1e47i nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bh\u0101j\u0101m: a devotee is free from the reactions of his karma because he has taken to devotional service. This same principle is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26). Sa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate: one who is engaged in devotional service has already been freed from the reactions of his material karma, and thus he immediately becomes brahma-bh\u016bta, or transcendental. This is also expressed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.21). K\u1e63\u012byante c\u0101sya karm\u0101\u1e47i: before attaining the stage of love, one becomes free from all the results of karma. The Lord is very kind and affectionate toward His devotees, and therefore a devotee, in any condition, is not subjected to the results of karma. A devotee never aspires for the heavenly planets. The heavenly planets, liberation and hell are nondifferent for a devotee, for he does not discriminate between different positions in the material world. A devotee is always eager to return home, back to Godhead, and remain there as the Lord\u2019s associate. This ambition becomes increasingly fervent in his heart, and therefore he does not care about material changes in his life. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura comments that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Citraketu\u2019s being cursed by P\u0101rvat\u012b should be considered the mercy of the Lord. The Lord wanted Citraketu to return to Godhead as soon as possible, and therefore he terminated all the reactions of his past deeds. Acting through the heart of P\u0101rvat\u012b, the Lord, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, cursed Citraketu in order to end all his material reactions. Thus Citraketu became V\u1e5btr\u0101sura in his next life and returned home, back to Godhead."

        "purport": " Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate doer of everything, in His original transcendental existence He is not responsible for the happiness and distress, or bondage and liberation, of the conditioned souls. These are due to the results of the fruitive activities of the living entities within this material world. By the order of a judge, one person is released from jail, and another is imprisoned, but the judge is not responsible, for the distress and happiness of these different people is due to their own activities. Although the government is ultimately the supreme authority, the justice is administered by the departments of the government, and the government is not responsible for the individual judgments. Therefore the government is equal to all the citizens. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is neutral to everyone, but for the maintenance of law and order His supreme government has various departments, which control the activities of the living entities. Another example given in this regard is that lilies open or close because of the sunshine, and thus the bumblebees enjoy or suffer, but the sunshine and the sun globe are not responsible for the happiness and distress of the bumblebees."

By using the word bh\u1e5btya-bh\u1e5bty\u0101n\u0101m, Lord \u015aiva pointed out that although Citraketu provided one example of tolerance and excellence, all the devotees who have taken shelter of the Lord as eternal servants are glorious. They have no eagerness to be happy by being placed in the heavenly planets, becoming liberated or becoming one with Brahman, the supreme effulgence. These benefits do not appeal to their minds. They are simply interested in giving direct service to the Lord."

This is also confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.44): Durg\u0101 \u2014 the goddess P\u0101rvat\u012b, the wife of Lord \u015aiva \u2014 is extremely powerful. She can create, maintain and annihilate any number of universes by her sweet will, but she acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not independently. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is impartial, but because this is the material world of duality, such relative terms as happiness and distress, curses and favors, are created by the will of the Supreme. Those who are not n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-para, pure devotees, must be disturbed by this duality of the material world, whereas devotees who are simply attached to the service of the Lord are not at all disturbed by it. For example, Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura was beaten with cane in twenty-two bazaars, but he was never disturbed; instead, he smilingly tolerated the beating. Despite the disturbing dualities of the material world, devotees are not disturbed at all. Because they fix their minds on the lotus feet of the Lord and concentrate on the holy name of the Lord, they do not feel the so-called pains and pleasures caused by the dualities of this material world."

        "purport": " The happiness and distress of the material world of duality are both mistaken ideas. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Antya 4.176) it is said: The distinctions between happiness and distress in the material world of duality are simply mental concoctions, for the so-called happiness and distress are actually one and the same. They are like the happiness and distress in dreams. A sleeping man creates his happiness and distress by dreaming, although actually they have no existence. The other example given in this verse is that a flower garland is originally very nice, but by mistake, for want of mature knowledge, one may consider it a snake. In this connection there is a statement by Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b: vi\u015bva\u1e41 p\u016br\u1e47a-sukh\u0101yate. Everyone in this material world is distressed by miserable conditions, but \u015ar\u012bla Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b says that this world is full of happiness. How is this possible? He answers, yat-k\u0101ru\u1e47ya-kat\u0101k\u1e63a-vaibhavavat\u0101\u1e41 ta\u1e41 gauram eva stuma\u1e25. A devotee accepts the distress of this material world as happiness only due to the causeless mercy of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. By His personal behavior, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu showed that He was never distressed but always happy in chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. One should follow in the footsteps of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and engage constantly in chanting the mah\u0101-mantra \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Then he will never feel the distresses of the world of duality. In any condition of life one will be happy if he chants the holy name of the Lord. In dreams we sometimes enjoy eating sweet rice and sometimes suffer as if one of our beloved family members had died. Because the same mind and body exist in the same material world of duality when we are awake, the so-called happiness and distress of this world are no better than the false, superficial happiness of dreams. The mind is the via medium in both dreams and wakefulness, and everything created by the mind in terms of sa\u1e45kalpa and vikalpa, acceptance and rejection, is called manodharma, or mental concoction."

A devotee does not need to cultivate knowledge to understand the falsity or temporary existence of this material world.

As confirmed elsewhere in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.7): One who engages in unalloyed devotional service to V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, automatically becomes aware of this material world, and therefore he is naturally detached. This detachment is possible because of his high standard of knowledge. The speculative philosopher tries to understand that this material world is false by cultivating knowledge, but this understanding is automatically manifested in the person of a devotee, without separate endeavor. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers may be very proud of their so-called knowledge, but because they do not understand V\u0101sudeva (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti), they do not understand the world of duality, which is a manifestation of V\u0101sudeva\u2019s external energy.

When they actually become pure, they surrender to the lotus feet of V\u0101sudeva. Therefore, the Absolute Truth is easier to understand for a devotee than for j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who simply speculate to understand V\u0101sudeva.

        "purport": " It is said, vai\u1e63\u1e47avera kriy\u0101, mudr\u0101 vij\u00f1eha n\u0101 bujhaya: one should not be astonished to see the activities of exalted, liberated Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. As one should not be misled by the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should also not be misled by the activities of His devotees. Both the Lord and His devotees are liberated. They are on the same platform, the only difference being that the Lord is the master and the devotees are servants. Qualitatively, they are one and the same. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.29) the Lord says: \u201cI envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.\u201d From this statement by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is clear that the devotees of the Lord are always extremely dear to Him. In effect, Lord \u015aiva told P\u0101rvat\u012b, \u201cBoth Citraketu and I are always very dear to the Supreme Lord. In other words, both he and I are on the same level as servants of the Lord. We are always friends, and sometimes we enjoy joking words between us. When Citraketu loudly laughed at my behavior, he did so on friendly terms, and therefore there was no reason to curse him.\u201d Thus Lord \u015aiva tried to convince his wife, P\u0101rvat\u012b, that her cursing of Citraketu was not very sensible. Here is a difference between male and female that exists even in the higher statuses of life \u2014 in fact, even between Lord \u015aiva and his wife. Lord \u015aiva could understand Citraketu very nicely, but P\u0101rvat\u012b could not. Thus even in the higher statuses of life there is a difference between the understanding of a male and that of a female. It may be clearly said that the understanding of a woman is always inferior to the understanding of a man. In the Western countries there is now agitation to the effect that man and woman should be considered equal, but from this verse it appears that woman is always less intelligent than man. It is clear that Citraketu wanted to criticize the behavior of his friend Lord \u015aiva because Lord \u015aiva was sitting with his wife on his lap. Then, too, Lord \u015aiva wanted to criticize Citraketu for externally posing as a great devotee but being interested in enjoying with the Vidy\u0101dhar\u012b women. These were all friendly jokes; there was nothing serious for which Citraketu should have been cursed by P\u0101rvat\u012b. Upon hearing the instructions of Lord \u015aiva, P\u0101rvat\u012b must have been very much ashamed for cursing Citraketu to become a demon. Mother P\u0101rvat\u012b could not appreciate Citraketu\u2019s position, and therefore she cursed him, but when she understood the instructions of Lord \u015aiva she was ashamed."

Therefore \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b advised that the history of Citraketu be heard from a devotee. Anything about devotional service or the characteristics of the Lord and His devotees must be heard from a devotee, not from a professional reciter. This is advised herein. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s secretary also advised that one learn the history of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from a devotee: y\u0101ha, bh\u0101gavata pada vai\u1e63\u1e47avera sth\u0101ne. One should not hear the statements of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from professional reciters, or else they will not be effective. Quoting from Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, \u015ar\u012b San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b has strictly forbidden us to hear about the activities of the Lord and His devotees from the mouths of nondevotees: \u201cOne should not hear anything about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from a non-Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects; similarly, talks about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a given by a non-Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava are also poisonous.\u201d One must be a bona fide devotee, and then he can preach and impress devotional service upon his listeners."
