Being dependent and being obliged to accept material bodies, belligerent subordinates are sometimes victorious and sometimes defeated.",

Elsewhere in the G\u012bt\u0101 (3.27) the Lord says: \u201cThe bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.\u201d The living entities work only under the direction of the Supreme Lord. The Lord gives orders to material nature, and she arranges facilities for the living entities. The living entities are not independent, although they foolishly think themselves the doers (kart\u0101). Victory is always with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As for the subordinate living entities, they fight under the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Victory or defeat is not actually theirs; it is an arrangement by the Lord through the agency of material nature. Pride in victory, or moroseness in defeat, is useless. One should fully depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is responsible for the victory and defeat of all living entities. The Lord advises, niyata\u1e41 kuru karma tva\u1e41 karma jy\u0101yo hy akarma\u1e47a\u1e25: \u201cPerform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction.\u201d The living entity is ordered to act according to his position. Victory or defeat depends on the Supreme Lord. Karma\u1e47y ev\u0101dhik\u0101ras te m\u0101 phale\u1e63u kad\u0101cana: \u201cYou have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of actions.\u201d One must act sincerely, according to his position. Victory or defeat depends on the Lord. V\u1e5btr\u0101sura encouraged Indra, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be morose because of my victory. There is no need to stop fighting. Instead, you should go on with your duty. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desires, you will certainly be victorious.\u201d This verse is very instructive for sincere workers in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. We should not be jubilant in victory or morose in defeat. We should make a sincere effort to implement the will of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, and we should not be concerned with victory and defeat. Our only duty is to work sincerely, so that our activities may be recognized by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

Since we act under the control of the Supreme according to our karma, no one is independent, from Brahm\u0101 down to the insignificant ant.

Therefore the father and mother are not the creators of the living entity. According to the living entity\u2019s karma, fruitive activities, he is put into the semen of the father, who injects the living entity into the womb of the mother. Then according to the body of the mother and father (yath\u0101-yoni yath\u0101-b\u012bjam), the living entity accepts a body and takes birth to suffer or enjoy. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the original cause of one\u2019s birth. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the cause of one\u2019s being killed. No one is independent; everyone is dependent.

It is due to the mercy or chastisement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that one gains or loses everything material. No one is independent; everyone is dependent on the mercy or chastisement of the Supreme Lord. There is a common saying in Bengal that the Lord has ten hands. This means that He has control everywhere \u2014 in the eight directions and up and down. If He wants to take everything away from us with His ten hands, we cannot protect anything with our two hands. Similarly, if He wants to bestow benedictions upon us with His ten hands, we cannot factually receive them all with our two hands; in other words, the benedictions exceed our ambitions. The conclusion is that even though we do not wish to be separated from our possessions, sometimes the Lord forcibly takes them from us; and sometimes He showers such benedictions upon us that we are unable to receive them all. Therefore either in opulence or in distress we are not independent; everything is dependent on the sweet will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
