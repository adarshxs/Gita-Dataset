        "purport": " N\u0101rada Muni saw that the boys known as the Harya\u015bvas were already purified because of living in that holy place and were practically ready for liberation. Why then should they be encouraged to become entangled in family life, which is so dark that once having entered it one cannot leave it? Through this analogy, N\u0101rada Muni asked them to consider why they should follow their father\u2019s order to be entangled in family life. Indirectly, he asked them to find within the cores of their hearts the situation of the Supersoul, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, for then they would truly be experienced. In other words, one who is too involved in his material environment and does not look within the core of his heart is increasingly entangled in the illusory energy. N\u0101rada Muni\u2019s purpose was to get the sons of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a to divert their attention toward spiritual realization instead of involving themselves in the ordinary but complicated affairs of propagation. The same advice was given by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to his father (Bh\u0101g. 7.5.5): In the dark well of family life, one is always full of anxiety because of having accepted a temporary body. If one wants to free himself from this anxiety, one should immediately leave family life and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. N\u0101rada Muni advised the Harya\u015bvas not to enter household life. Since they were already advanced in spiritual knowledge, why should they be entangled in that way?"

After considering these by themselves, the Harya\u015bvas could understand that the living entity encaged in his body seeks happiness, but takes no interest in how to become free from his encagement. This is a very important verse, since all the living entities in the material world are very active, having obtained their particular types of bodies. A man works all day and night for sense gratification, and animals like hogs and dogs also work for sense gratification all day and night. Birds, beasts and all other conditioned living entities engage in various activities without knowledge of the soul encaged within the body. Especially in the human form of body, one\u2019s duty is to act in such a way that he can release himself from his encagement, but without the instructions of N\u0101rada or his representative in the disciplic succession, people blindly engage in bodily activities to enjoy m\u0101y\u0101-sukha \u2014 flickering, temporary happiness. They do not know how to become free from their material encagement. \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva therefore said that such activity is not at all good, since it encages the soul again and again in a body subjected to the threefold miseries of the material condition. The Harya\u015bvas, the sons of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a, could immediately understand the purport of N\u0101rada\u2019s instructions. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is especially meant for such enlightenment. We are trying to enlighten humanity so that people may come to the understanding that they should work hard in tapasya for self-realization and freedom from the continuous bondage of birth, death, old age and disease in one body after another. M\u0101y\u0101, however, is very strong; she is expert in putting impediments in the way of this understanding. Therefore sometimes one comes to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement but again falls into the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, not understanding the importance of this movement."

        "purport": " A woman who has no husband declares herself independent, which means that she becomes a prostitute. A prostitute generally dresses herself in various fashions intended to attract a man\u2019s attention to the lower part of her body. Today it has become a much advertised fashion for a woman to go almost naked, covering the lower part of her body only slightly, in order to draw the attention of a man to her private parts for sexual enjoyment. The intelligence engaged to attract a man to the lower part of the body is the intelligence of a professional prostitute. Similarly, the intelligence of a living entity who does not turn his attention toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement simply changes dresses like a prostitute. What is the benefit of such foolish intelligence? One should be intelligently conscious in such a way that he need no longer change from one body to another. Karm\u012bs change their professions at any moment, but a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not change his profession, for his only profession is to attract the attention of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and living a very simple life, without following daily changes of fashion. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, fashionable persons are taught to adopt one fashion \u2014 the dress of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava with a shaved head and tilaka. They are taught to be always clean in mind, dress and eating in order to be fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. What is the use of changing one\u2019s dress, sometimes wearing long hair and a long beard and sometimes dressing otherwise? This is not good. One should not waste his time in such frivolous activities. One should always be fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and take the cure of devotional service with firm determination."

If a man becomes the husband of a prostitute, he cannot be happy, and similarly one who follows the dictations of material intelligence and material consciousness will never be happy. One must judiciously understand the activities of material nature.

Scientists, for example, try to be the masters of material nature, life after life, not caring to understand the Supreme Person, under whose direction everything within this material world is moving. Trying to be the masters of material nature, they are imitation gods who declare to the public that scientific advancement will one day be able to avoid the so-called control of God. In fact, however, the living being, unable to control the rulings of God, is forced to associate with the prostitute of polluted intelligence and accept various material bodies. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.22): \u201cThe living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is knowledge and austerity. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person takes knowledge from the Vedic literature, and at the same time he must practice austerities. To attain freedom from material life, one must take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Otherwise, if one very busily engages in the so-called advancement of science, what benefit will he derive? If one is carried away by the waves of nature, what is the meaning of being a great scientist or philosopher? Mundane science and philosophy are also material creations.

The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra explains that one should inquire about the Supreme Soul. Such inquiry about the Supreme is called brahma jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101. The Absolute Truth, tattva, is explained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.11): \u201cLearned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 or Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d The Absolute Truth appears to neophytes as impersonal Brahman and to advanced mystic yog\u012bs as Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supersoul, but devotees, who are further advanced, understand the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This material cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the energy of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. \u201cWhatever we see in this world is but an expansion of various energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is like a fire that spreads illumination for a long distance although it is situated in one place.\u201d (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a) The entire cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore if one does not conduct research to find the supreme cause, but instead falsely engages in frivolous, temporary activities, what is the use of demanding recognition as an important scientist or philosopher? If one does not know the ultimate cause, what is the use of his scientific and philosophical research? The puru\u1e63a, the original person \u2014 Bhagav\u0101n, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2014 can be understood only by devotional service.

One must try to understand that the material elements are the separated, inferior energy of the Lord and that the living entity is the Lord\u2019s spiritual energy. Whatever we experience, including matter and the spirit soul, the living force, is but a combination of two energies of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2014 the inferior energy and the superior energy. One should seriously study the facts concerning creation, maintenance and devastation, as well as the permanent place from which one never need return (yad gatv\u0101 na nivartante). Human society should study this, but instead of culturing such knowledge, people are attracted to temporary happiness and sense gratification, culminating in bottomless, topless passion.

        "purport": " The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is very eager to present Vedic literature in modern languages, especially Western languages such as English, French and German. The leaders of the Western world, the Americans and Europeans, have become the idols of modern civilization because the Western people are very sophisticated in temporary activities for the advancement of material civilization. A sane man, however, can see that all such grand activities, although perhaps very important for temporary life, have nothing to do with eternal life. The entire world is imitating the materialistic civilization of the West, and therefore the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is very much interested in giving the Western people knowledge by translating the original Sanskrit Vedic literatures into Western languages. The word vivikta-padam refers to the path of logical discourses concerning the aim of life. If one does not discuss that which is important in life, one is put into darkness and must struggle for existence. What, then, is the benefit of his advancement in knowledge? The people of the West are seeing their students becoming hippies, despite gorgeous arrangements for university education. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, however, is trying to convert misguided, drug-addicted students to the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engage them in the best welfare activities for human society."

The words of a material father who endeavors to engage his son in material activities are not the real instructions of the father.",
        "purport": " Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.7) says, prav\u1e5btti\u1e41 ca niv\u1e5btti\u1e41 ca jan\u0101 na vidur \u0101sur\u0101\u1e25: demons, who are less than human beings but are not called animals, do not know the meaning of prav\u1e5btti and niv\u1e5btti, work to be done and work not to be done. In the material world, every living entity has a desire to lord it over the material world as much as possible. This is called prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga. All the \u015b\u0101stras, however, advise niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga, or release from the materialistic way of life. Apart from the \u015b\u0101stras of the Vedic civilization, which is the oldest of the world, other \u015b\u0101stras agree on this point. For example, in the Buddhist \u015b\u0101stras Lord Buddha advises that one achieve nirv\u0101\u1e47a by giving up the materialistic way of life. In the Bible, which is also \u015b\u0101stra, one will find the same advice: one should cease materialistic life and return to the kingdom of God. In any \u015b\u0101stra one may examine, especially the Vedic \u015b\u0101stra, the same advice is given: one should give up his materialistic life and return to his original, spiritual life. \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya also propounds the same conclusion. Brahma satya\u1e41 jagan mithy\u0101: this material world or materialistic life is simply illusion, and therefore one should stop his illusory activities and come to the platform of Brahman. The word \u015b\u0101stra refers to the scriptures, particularly the Vedic books of knowledge. The Vedas \u2014 S\u0101ma, Yajur, \u1e5ag and Atharva \u2014 and any other books deriving knowledge from these Vedas are considered Vedic literatures. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the essence of all Vedic knowledge, and therefore it is the scripture whose instructions should be especially accepted. In this essence of all \u015b\u0101stras, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally advises that one give up all other duties and surrender unto Him (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). One should be initiated into following the principles of \u015b\u0101stra. In offering initiation, our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement asks one to come to the conclusion of \u015b\u0101stra by taking the advice of the supreme speaker of the \u015b\u0101stra, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, forgetting the principles of the materialistic way of life. Therefore the principles we advise are no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling and no meat-eating. These four types of engagement will enable an intelligent person to get free from the materialistic life and return home, back to Godhead. In regard to the instructions of the father and mother, it may be said that every living entity, including even the insignificant cats, dogs and serpents, takes birth of a father and mother. Therefore, getting a material father and mother is not a problem. In every form of life, birth after birth, the living entity gets a father and mother. In human society, however, if one is satisfied with his material father and mother and their instructions and does not make further progress by accepting a spiritual master and being educated in the \u015b\u0101stras, he certainly remains in darkness. The material father and mother are important only if they are interested in educating their son to become free from the clutches of death. As instructed by \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva (Bh\u0101g. 5.5.18): pit\u0101 na sa sy\u0101j janan\u012b na s\u0101 sy\u0101t/ na mocayed ya\u1e25 samupeta-m\u1e5btyum. One should not strive to become a mother or father if one cannot save one\u2019s dependent son from the impending danger of death. A parent who does not know how to save his son has no value because such fathers and mothers may be had in any form of life, even among the cats, dogs and so on. Only a father and mother who can elevate their son to the spiritual platform are bona fide parents. Therefore according to the Vedic system it is said, janman\u0101 j\u0101yate \u015b\u016bdra\u1e25: one is born of a material father and mother as a \u015b\u016bdra. The purpose of life, however, is to become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a first-class man. A first-class intelligent man is called a br\u0101hma\u1e47a because he knows the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute Truth. According to the Vedic instructions, tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet: to know this science, one must approach a bona fide guru, a spiritual master who will initiate the disciple with the sacred thread so that he may understand the Vedic knowledge. Janman\u0101 j\u0101yate \u015b\u016bdra\u1e25 sa\u1e41sk\u0101r\u0101d dhi bhaved dvija\u1e25. Becoming a br\u0101hma\u1e47a through the endeavor of a bona fide spiritual master is called sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. After initiation, one is engaged in study of the \u015b\u0101stra, which teaches the student how to gain release from materialistic life and return home, back to Godhead. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is teaching this higher knowledge of retiring from materialistic life to return to Godhead, but unfortunately many parents are not very satisfied with this movement. Aside from the parents of our students, many businessmen are also dissatisfied because we teach our students to abandon intoxication, meat-eating, illicit sex and gambling. If the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement spreads, the so-called businessmen will have to close their slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette factories. Therefore they are also very much afraid. However, we have no alternative than to teach our disciples to free themselves from materialistic life. We must instruct them in the opposite of material life to save them from the repetition of birth and death. N\u0101rada Muni, therefore, advised the Harya\u015bvas, the sons of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a, that instead of begetting progeny, it would be better to leave and achieve the perfection of spiritual understanding according to the instructions of the \u015b\u0101stras. The importance of the \u015b\u0101stras is mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.23): \u201cOne who disregards the injunctions of the \u015b\u0101stras and acts whimsically, as he likes, never achieves the perfection of life, not to speak of happiness. Nor does he return home to the spiritual world.\u201d"

After hearing the instructions of N\u0101rada Muni, the Harya\u015bvas, the sons of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a, decided not to be entangled in materialistic life by begetting hundreds of children and having to take care of them.

Lord \u015aiva embraces N\u0101rada Muni and begins talking in an ecstatic voice, and seeing Lord \u015aiva dancing with N\u0101rada, Lord Brahm\u0101 also joins, saying, \u201cAll of you kindly chant\u00a0\u2018Hari bol! Hari bol!\u2019\u201d The King of heaven, Indra, also gradually joins with great satisfaction and begins dancing and chanting \u201cHari bol! Hari bol!\u201d In this way, by the influence of the transcendental vibration of the holy name of God, the whole universe becomes ecstatic. Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura says, \u201cWhen the universe becomes ecstatic, my desire is satisfied. I therefore pray unto the lotus feet of R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b that this chanting of harer n\u0101ma may go on nicely like this.\u201d Lord Brahm\u0101 is the guru of N\u0101rada Muni, who is the guru of Vy\u0101sadeva, and Vy\u0101sadeva is the guru of Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya. Thus the Gau\u1e0d\u012bya M\u0101dhva samprad\u0101ya is in the disciplic succession from N\u0101rada Muni. The members of this disciplic succession \u2014 in other words, the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement \u2014 should follow in the footsteps of N\u0101rada Muni by chanting the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. They should go everywhere to deliver the fallen souls by vibrating the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta. That will please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can spiritually advance if one actually follows the instructions of N\u0101rada Muni. If one pleases N\u0101rada Muni, then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, is also pleased (yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101da\u1e25). The immediate spiritual master is the representative of N\u0101rada Muni; there is no difference between the instructions of N\u0101rada Muni and those of the present spiritual master. Both N\u0101rada Muni and the present spiritual master speak the same teachings of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.65-66): \u201cAlways think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend. Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\u201d"

But N\u0101rada Muni took advantage of their good behavior and culture to properly direct them not to be involved with this material world, but to use their culture and knowledge to end their material affairs. The Harya\u015bvas abided by the order of N\u0101rada Muni, but when news of this was brought to Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a, the praj\u0101pati, instead of being happy with the actions of N\u0101rada Muni, was extremely sorrowful. Similarly, we are trying to bring as many young men as possible to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement for their ultimate benefit, but the parents of the young men joining this movement, being very sorry, are lamenting and making counterpropaganda. Of course, Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a did not make propaganda against N\u0101rada Muni, but later, as we shall see, Dak\u1e63a cursed N\u0101rada Muni for his benevolent activities. This is the way of materialistic life. A materialistic father and mother want to engage their sons in begetting children, striving for improved economic conditions and rotting in materialistic life. They are not unhappy when their children become spoiled, useless citizens, but they lament when they join the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement to achieve the ultimate goal of life. This animosity between parents and the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has existed since time immemorial. Even N\u0101rada Muni was condemned, not to speak of others. Nevertheless, N\u0101rada Muni never gives up his mission.

In Kali-yuga, people cannot undergo severe austerities like those mentioned herein \u2014 drinking only water and eating only air for many months. One cannot imitate such a process. But at least one must undergo some austerity by giving up four unwanted principles, namely illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Anyone can easily practice this tapasya, and then the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra will be effective without delay. One should not give up the process of austerity. If possible, one should bathe in the waters of the Ganges or Yamun\u0101, or in the absence of the Ganges and Yamun\u0101 one may bathe in the water of the sea. This is an item of austerity. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has therefore established two very large centers, one in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and another in M\u0101y\u0101pur, Navadv\u012bpa. There one may bathe in the Ganges or Yamun\u0101, chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and thus become perfect and return home, back to Godhead."

Generally the word nigama refers to the Vedas, but here nigama refers to the instructions contained in the Vedas. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam says, nigama-kalpa-taror galita\u1e41 phalam: the Vedic instructions are like a tree, of which \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the ripened fruit. N\u0101rada Muni is engaged in distributing this fruit, and therefore he instructed Vy\u0101sadeva to write this Mah\u0101-pur\u0101\u1e47a, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, for the benefit of ignorant human society. \u201cThe material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him, can be directly mitigated by the linking process of devotional service.

Vy\u0101sadeva actually followed N\u0101rada and did this. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the supreme instruction of the Vedas.

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said, sanny\u0101s\u012bra alpa chidra sarva-loke g\u0101ya (Cc. Madhya 12.51). In society one will find many sanny\u0101s\u012bs, v\u0101naprasthas, g\u1e5bhasthas and brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, but if all of them properly live in accordance with their duties, they are understood to be s\u0101dhus. Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a was certainly a s\u0101dhu because he had executed such great austerities that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, had appeared before him. Nevertheless, he had a fault-finding mentality. He improperly thought N\u0101rada Muni to be as\u0101dhu, or nonsaintly, because N\u0101rada had foiled his intentions. Desiring to train his sons to become g\u1e5bhasthas fully equipped with knowledge, Dak\u1e63a had sent them to execute austerities by N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-saras. N\u0101rada Muni, however, taking advantage of their highly elevated position in austerity, instructed them to become Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas in the renounced order. This is the duty of N\u0101rada Muni and his followers. They must show everyone the path of renouncing this material world and returning home, back to Godhead. Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a, however, could not see the exaltedness of the duties N\u0101rada Muni performed in relation to his sons. Unable to appreciate N\u0101rada Muni\u2019s behavior, Dak\u1e63a accused N\u0101rada of being as\u0101dhu. The words bhik\u1e63or m\u0101rga, \u201cthe path of the renounced order,\u201d are very significant in this regard. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is called trida\u1e47\u1e0di-bhik\u1e63u because his duty is to beg alms from the homes of g\u1e5bhasthas and to give the g\u1e5bhasthas spiritual instructions. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is allowed to beg from door to door, but a g\u1e5bhastha cannot do so. G\u1e5bhasthas may earn their living according to the four divisions of spiritual life. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a g\u1e5bhastha may earn his livelihood by becoming a learned scholar and teaching people in general how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He may also assume the duty of worship himself. Therefore it is said that only br\u0101hma\u1e47as may engage in Deity worship, and they may accept as pras\u0101da whatever people offer the Deity. Although a br\u0101hma\u1e47a may sometimes accept charity, it is not for his personal maintenance but for the worship of the Deity. Thus a br\u0101hma\u1e47a does not stock anything for his future use. Similarly, k\u1e63atriyas may collect taxes from the citizens, and they must also protect the citizens, enforce rules and regulations, and maintain law and order. Vai\u015byas should earn their livelihood through agriculture and cow protection, and \u015b\u016bdras should maintain their livelihood by serving the three higher classes. Unless one becomes a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, one cannot take sanny\u0101sa. Sanny\u0101s\u012bs and brahmac\u0101r\u012bs may beg alms door to door, but a g\u1e5bhastha cannot. Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a condemned N\u0101rada Muni because N\u0101rada, a brahmac\u0101r\u012b who could beg from door to door, had made sanny\u0101s\u012bs of Dak\u1e63a\u2019s sons, who were being trained to be g\u1e5bhasthas. Dak\u1e63a was extremely angry at N\u0101rada because he thought that N\u0101rada had done him a great injustice. According to Dak\u1e63a\u2019s opinion, N\u0101rada Muni had misled Dak\u1e63a\u2019s inexperienced sons (as\u0101dhv ak\u0101ry arbhak\u0101\u1e47\u0101m). Dak\u1e63a regarded his sons as innocent boys who had been misled when N\u0101rada showed them the renounced order of life. Because of all these considerations, Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a charged that N\u0101rada Muni was as\u0101dhu and should not have adopted the dress of a s\u0101dhu. Sometimes a saintly person is misunderstood by g\u1e5bhasthas, especially when he instructs their young sons to accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Generally a g\u1e5bhastha thinks that unless one enters g\u1e5bhastha life he cannot properly enter the renounced order. If a young man immediately adopts the path of the renounced order in accordance with the instructions of N\u0101rada or a member of his disciplic succession, his parents become very angry. This same phenomenon is occurring in our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement because we are instructing all the young boys in the Western countries to follow the path of renunciation. We allow g\u1e5bhastha life, but a g\u1e5bhastha also follows the path of renunciation. Even a g\u1e5bhastha has to give up so many bad habits that his parents think his life has been practically destroyed. We allow no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication, and consequently the parents wonder how, if there are so many no\u2019s, one\u2019s life can be positive. In the Western countries especially, these four prohibited activities practically constitute the life and soul of the modern population. Therefore parents sometimes dislike our movement, just as Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a disliked the activities of N\u0101rada and accused N\u0101rada of dishonesty. Nevertheless, although parents may be angry at us, we must perform our duty without hesitation because we are in the disciplic succession from N\u0101rada Muni. People addicted to householder life wonder how one can give up the enjoyment of g\u1e5bhastha life, which is a concession for sex enjoyment, simply to become a mendicant in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They do not know that the householder\u2019s concession for sex life cannot be regulated unless one accepts the life of a mendicant. The Vedic civilization therefore enjoins that at the end of one\u2019s fiftieth year one must give up household life. This is compulsory. However, because modern civilization is misled, householders want to remain in family life until death, and therefore they are suffering. In such cases, the disciples of N\u0101rada Muni advise all the members of the younger generation to join the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement immediately. There is nothing wrong in this."

O N\u0101rada Muni, O personality of sinful action, you have obstructed their progress toward good fortune in this world and the next because they are still indebted to the saintly persons, the demigods and their father.",
        "purport": " As soon as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a takes birth, he assumes three kinds of debts \u2014 debts to great saints, debts to the demigods and debts to his father. The son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a must undergo celibacy (brahmacarya) to clear his debts to the saintly persons, he must perform ritualistic ceremonies to clear his debts to the demigods, and he must beget children to become free from his debts to his father. Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a argued that although the renounced order is recommended for liberation, one cannot attain liberation unless one fulfills his obligations to the demigods, the saints and his father. Since Dak\u1e63a\u2019s sons had not liberated themselves from these three debts, how could N\u0101rada Muni have led them to the renounced order of life? Apparently, Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a did not know the final decision of the \u015b\u0101stras. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.41): Everyone is indebted to the demigods, to living entities in general, to his family, to the pit\u0101s and so on, but if one fully surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Mukunda, who can give one liberation, even if one performs no yaj\u00f1as, one is freed from all debts. Even if one does not repay his debts, he is freed from all debts if he renounces the material world for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose lotus feet are the shelter of everyone. This is the verdict of the \u015b\u0101stra. Therefore N\u0101rada Muni was completely right in instructing the sons of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a to renounce this material world immediately and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unfortunately, Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a, the father of the Harya\u015bvas and Saval\u0101\u015bvas, did not understand the great service rendered by N\u0101rada Muni. Dak\u1e63a therefore addressed him as p\u0101pa (the personality of sinful activities) and as\u0101dhu (a nonsaintly person). Since N\u0101rada Muni was a great saint and Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he tolerated all such accusations from Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a. He merely performed his duty as a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava by delivering all the sons of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a, enabling them to return home, back to Godhead."

        "purport": " This mentality of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a still continues even today. When young boys join the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, their fathers and so-called guardians are very angry at the propounder of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement because they think that their sons have been unnecessarily induced to deprive themselves of the material enjoyments of eating, drinking and merrymaking. Karm\u012bs, fruitive workers, think that one should fully enjoy his present life in this material world and also perform some pious activities to be promoted to higher planetary systems for further enjoyment in the next life. A yog\u012b, however, especially a bhakti-yog\u012b, is callous to the opinions of this material world. He is not interested in traveling to the higher planetary systems of the demigods to enjoy a long life in an advanced materialistic civilization. As stated by Prabodh\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b, kaivalya\u1e41 narak\u0101yate trida\u015ba-p\u016br \u0101k\u0101\u015ba-pu\u1e63p\u0101yate: for a devotee, merging into the Brahman existence is hellish, and life in the higher planetary systems of the demigods is a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, a phantasmagoria with no real existence at all. A pure devotee is not interested in yogic perfection, travel to higher planetary systems, or oneness with Brahman. He is interested only in rendering service to the Personality of Godhead. Since Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a was a karm\u012b, he could not appreciate the great service N\u0101rada Muni had rendered his eleven thousand sons. Instead, he accused N\u0101rada Muni of being sinful and charged that because N\u0101rada Muni was associated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord would also be defamed. Thus Dak\u1e63a criticized that N\u0101rada Muni was an offender to the Lord although he was known as an associate of the Lord."

Although you wear the dress of a devotee, you create enmity with people who are not your enemies, or you break friendship and create enmity between friends. Are you not ashamed of posing as a devotee while performing these abominable actions?",
        "purport": " Such are the criticisms that must be borne by the servants of N\u0101rada Muni in the disciplic succession. Through the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, we are trying to train young people to become devotees and return home, back to Godhead, by following rigid regulative principles, but our service is appreciated neither in India nor abroad in the Western countries where we are endeavoring to spread this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. In India the caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as have become enemies of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement because we elevate foreigners, who are supposed to be mlecchas and yavanas, to the position of br\u0101hma\u1e47as. We train them in austerities and penances and recognize them as br\u0101hma\u1e47as by awarding them sacred threads. Thus the caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as of India are very displeased by our activities in the Western world. In the West also, the parents of the young people who join this movement have also become enemies. We have no business creating enemies, but the process is such that nondevotees will always be inimical toward us. Nevertheless, as stated in the \u015b\u0101stras, a devotee should be both tolerant and merciful. Devotees engaged in preaching should be prepared to be accused by ignorant persons, and yet they must be very merciful to the fallen conditioned souls. If one can execute his duty in the disciplic succession of N\u0101rada Muni, his service will surely be recognized. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.68-69): \u201cFor one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me. There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear.\u201d Let us continue preaching the message of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not be afraid of enemies. Our only duty is to satisfy the Lord by this preaching, which will be accepted as service by Lord Caitanya and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. We must sincerely serve the Lord and not be deterred by so-called enemies. In this verse the word sauh\u1e5bda-ghnam (\u201ca breaker of friendship\u201d) is used. Because N\u0101rada Muni and the members of his disciplic succession disrupt friendships and family life, they are sometimes accused of being sauh\u1e5bda-ghnam, creators of enmity between relatives. Actually such devotees are friends of every living entity (suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m), but they are misunderstood to be enemies. Preaching can be a difficult, thankless task, but a preacher must follow the orders of the Supreme Lord and be unafraid of materialistic persons."

The sanny\u0101s\u012bs of Kali-yuga who change their robes from white to saffron and then think they can do whatever they like are more abominable than materialistic g\u1e5bhasthas. This is not recommended anywhere. Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a was right in pointing out this defect, but he did not know that N\u0101rada Muni had aroused the spirit of renunciation in the Harya\u015bvas and Saval\u0101\u015bvas through full knowledge. Such enlightened renunciation is desirable. One should enter the renounced order with full knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101na-vair\u0101gya), for the perfection of life is possible for one who renounces this material world in that way. This elevated stage can be reached very easily, as supported by the statements of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.7): \u201cBy rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.\u201d If one seriously engages in devotional service to Lord V\u0101sudeva, j\u00f1\u0101na and vair\u0101gya are automatically manifest in one\u2019s person. There is no doubt of this. Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a\u2019s accusation that N\u0101rada had not actually elevated his sons to the platform of knowledge was not factual. All the sons of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a had first been raised to the platform of j\u00f1\u0101na and had then automatically renounced this world. In summary, unless one\u2019s knowledge is awakened, renunciation cannot take place, for without elevated knowledge one cannot give up attachment for material enjoyment."

Sex enjoyment is so strong that a woman becomes pregnant and suffers at the time of childbirth but she becomes pregnant again, despite her experience. According to Dak\u1e63a\u2019s philosophy, one should become implicated in material enjoyment so that after experiencing the distress of such enjoyment. one will automatically renounce.

Therefore he wanted to prove that N\u0101rada Muni, although dressed like a s\u0101dhu, was not actually a s\u0101dhu; he himself, although a householder, was a greater s\u0101dhu than N\u0101rada Muni."

Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a cursed N\u0101rada Muni by saying that although he had the facility to travel all over the universe, he would never be able to stay in one place. In the parampar\u0101 system from N\u0101rada Muni, I have also been cursed. Although I have many centers that would be suitable places of residence, I cannot stay anywhere, for I have been cursed by the parents of my young disciples. Since the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement was started, I have traveled all over the world two or three times a year, and although I am provided comfortable places to stay wherever I go, I cannot stay anywhere for more than three days or a week. I do not mind this curse by the parents of my disciples, but now it is necessary that I stay in one place to finish another task \u2014 this translation of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. If my young disciples, especially those who have taken sanny\u0101sa, take charge of traveling all over the world, it may be possible for me to transfer the curse of the parents to these young preachers. Then I may sit down conveniently in one place for the work of translation."

I accept this curse.\u201d He could have cursed Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a in return, but because he is a tolerant and merciful s\u0101dhu, he took no action.",
        "purport": " As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.25.21): \u201cThe symptoms of a s\u0101dhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities. He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.\u201d Because N\u0101rada Muni is the most elevated of s\u0101dhus, devotees, to deliver Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a he silently tolerated the curse. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has taught this principle to all His devotees: \u201cOne should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.\u201d Following the orders of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, one who preaches the glories of the Lord all over the world or all over the universe should be humbler than grass and more tolerant than a tree because a preacher cannot live an easygoing life. Indeed, a preacher must face many impediments. Not only is he sometimes cursed, but sometimes he must also suffer personal injury. For example, when Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu went to preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to the two roguish brothers Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i, they injured Him and made His head bleed, but nevertheless, He tolerantly delivered the two rogues, who became perfect Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. This is the duty of a preacher. Lord Jesus Christ even tolerated crucifixion. Therefore the curse against N\u0101rada was not very astonishing, and he tolerated it. Now, it may be asked why N\u0101rada Muni stayed in the presence of Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a and tolerated all his accusations and curses. Was that for Dak\u1e63a\u2019s deliverance? The answer is yes. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that after being insulted by Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a, N\u0101rada Muni should have left immediately, but he purposely stayed to hear all Dak\u1e63a\u2019s strong words so that Dak\u1e63a might be relieved of his anger. Praj\u0101pati Dak\u1e63a was not an ordinary man; he had accumulated the results of many pious activities. Therefore N\u0101rada Muni expected that after delivering his curse, Dak\u1e63a, satisfied and freed from anger, would repent his misbehavior and thus get a chance to become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and be delivered. When Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i offended Lord Nity\u0101nanda, Lord Nity\u0101nanda stood tolerantly, and therefore both brothers fell at His lotus feet and repented. Consequently they later became perfect Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas."
