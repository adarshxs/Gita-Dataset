        "purport": " V\u1e5btr\u0101sura rebuked both the demigods and the demoniac soldiers because the demons were running in fear of their lives and the demigods were killing them from behind. The actions of both were abominable. When a fight takes place, the opposing parties must be prepared to fight like heroes. A hero never runs from the field of battle. He always fights face to face, determined to gain victory or lay down his life in the fight. That is heroic. Killing an enemy from behind is also inglorious. When an enemy turns his back and runs in fear of his life, he should not be killed. This is the etiquette of military science. V\u1e5btr\u0101sura insulted the demoniac soldiers by comparing them to the stool of their mothers. Both stool and a cowardly son come from the abdomen of the mother, and V\u1e5btr\u0101sura said that there is no difference between them. A similar comparison was given by Tulas\u012b d\u0101sa, who commented that a son and urine both come from the same channel. In other words, semen and urine both come from the genitals, but semen produces a child whereas urine produces nothing. Therefore if a child is neither a hero nor a devotee, he is not a son but urine. Similarly, C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita also says: \u201cWhat is the use of a son who is neither glorious nor devoted to the Lord? Such a son is like a blind eye, which simply gives pain but cannot help one see.\u201d"

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.11) the Lord says: \u201cAs devotees surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101.\u201d Both Indra and V\u1e5btr\u0101sura were certainly devotees of the Lord, although Indra took instructions from Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to kill V\u1e5btr\u0101sura. The Lord was actually more favorable to V\u1e5btr\u0101sura because after being killed by Indra\u2019s thunderbolt, V\u1e5btr\u0101sura would go back to Godhead, whereas the victorious Indra would rot in this material world. Because both of them were devotees, the Lord awarded them the respective benedictions they wanted. V\u1e5btr\u0101sura never wanted material possessions, for he knew very well the nature of such possessions. To accumulate material possessions, one must labor very hard, and when he gets them he creates many enemies because this material world is always full of rivalry. If one becomes rich, his friends or relatives are envious. For ek\u0101nta-bhaktas, unalloyed devotees, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore never provides material possessions. A devotee sometimes needs some material possessions for preaching, but the possessions of a preacher are not like those of a karm\u012b. A karm\u012b\u2019s possessions are achieved as a result of karma, but those of a devotee are arranged by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to facilitate his devotional activities. Because a devotee never uses material possessions for any purpose other than the service of the Lord, the possessions of a devotee are not to be compared to those of a karm\u012b."

        "purport": " There are four objectives in human life \u2014 namely, religiosity (dharma), economic development (artha), sense gratification (k\u0101ma), and liberation (mok\u1e63a) from the bondage of material existence. People generally aspire for religiosity, economic development and sense gratification, but a devotee has no other desire than to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead both in this life and in the next. The special mercy for the unalloyed devotee is that the Lord saves him from hard labor to achieve the results of religion, economic development and sense gratification. Of course, if one wants such benefits, the Lord certainly awards them. Indra, for example, although a devotee, was not much interested in release from material bondage; instead, he desired sense gratification and a high standard of material happiness in the heavenly planets. V\u1e5btr\u0101sura, however, being an unalloyed devotee, aspired only to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord arranged for him to go back to Godhead after his bodily bondage was destroyed by Indra. V\u1e5btr\u0101sura requested Indra to release his thunderbolt against him as soon as possible so that both he and Indra would benefit according to their proportionate advancement in devotional service."
