Therefore they were unsure of whether there were many authorities or only one. If there were many authorities who gave different judgments, which could be contradictory, a person might be wrongly punished or wrongly rewarded, or he might be neither punished nor rewarded. According to our experience in the material world, a person punished in one court may appeal to another. Thus the same man may be either punished or rewarded according to different judgments. However, in the law of nature or the court of the Supreme Personality of Godhead there cannot be such contradictory judgments. The judges and their judgments must be perfect and free from contradictions. Actually the position of Yamar\u0101ja was very awkward in the case of Aj\u0101mila because the Yamad\u016btas were right in attempting to arrest Aj\u0101mila, but the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas had baffled them. Although Yamar\u0101ja, under these circumstances, was accused by both the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas and the Yamad\u016btas, he is perfect in administering justice because he is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore he will explain what his real position is and how everyone is controlled by the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead."

The partial manifestations of His personality are Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u015aiva, who are in charge of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this universe. He is like the two threads that form the length and breadth of a woven cloth. The entire world is controlled by Him just as a bull is controlled by a rope in its nose.",
        "purport": " The order carriers of Yamar\u0101ja suspected that there was a ruler even above Yamar\u0101ja. To eradicate their doubts, Yamar\u0101ja immediately replied, \u201cYes, there is one supreme controller above everything.\u201d Yamar\u0101ja is in charge of some of the moving living entities, namely the human beings, but the animals, who also move, are not under his control. Only human beings have consciousness of right and wrong, and among them only those who perform sinful activities come under the control of Yamar\u0101ja. Therefore although Yamar\u0101ja is a controller, he is only a departmental controller of a few living entities. There are other demigods who control many other departments, but above them all is one supreme controller, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25: the supreme controller is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Others, who control their own departments in the affairs of the universe, are insignificant in comparison to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme controller. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.7), matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat ki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1jaya: \u201cMy dear Dhana\u00f1jaya [Arjuna], no one is superior to Me.\u201d Therefore Yamar\u0101ja immediately cleared away the doubts of his assistants, the Yamad\u016btas, by confirming that there is a supreme controller above all others. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya explains that the words ota\u1e41 protam refer to the cause of all causes. The Supreme Lord is both vertical and horizontal to the cosmic manifestation. This is confirmed by the following verse from the Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a: Like the two threads, horizontal and vertical, of which a quilt is manufactured, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is situated as the vertical and horizontal cause of the cosmic manifestation."

In fear, the members of these orders all worship the Supreme Lord by offering Him presentations according to their respective activities.",
        "purport": " In this material world, everyone is conditioned, regardless of who he is. One may be a human being, a demigod or an animal, tree or plant, but everything is controlled by the laws of nature, and behind this natural control is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed by Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10), wherein K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram: \u201cThe material nature is working under My direction and producing all moving and nonmoving beings.\u201d Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is behind the natural machine, which works under His control. Apart from other living entities, the living being in the human form of body is systematically controlled by the Vedic injunctions in terms of the divisions of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama. A human being is expected to follow the rules and regulations of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama; otherwise he cannot escape punishment by Yamar\u0101ja. The point is that every human being is expected to elevate himself to the position of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the most intelligent man, and then one must transcend that position to become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. This is the perfection of life. The br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra can elevate themselves by worshiping the Lord according to their activities (sve sve karma\u1e47y abhirata\u1e25 sa\u1e41siddhi\u1e41 labhate nara\u1e25). The divisions of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama are necessary to insure the proper execution of duties and peaceful existence for everyone, but everyone is directed to worship the Supreme Lord, who is all-pervading (yena sarvam ida\u1e41 tatam). The Supreme Lord exists vertically and horizontally (ota\u1e41 protam), and therefore if one follows the Vedic injunctions by worshiping the Supreme Lord according to one\u2019s ability, his life will be perfect. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.13): \u201cO best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties [dharma] according to caste divisions and orders of life, is to please the Lord Hari.\u201d The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution offers the perfect process for making one eligible to return home, back to Godhead, because the aim of every var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama is to please the Supreme Lord. One can please the Lord under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, and if one does so his life is perfect. The Supreme Lord is worshipable, and everyone worships Him directly or indirectly. Those who worship Him directly get the results of liberation quickly, whereas the liberation of those who serve Him indirectly is delayed. The words n\u0101mabhir v\u0101ci are very important. In the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution, there are different names \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, \u015b\u016bdra, brahmac\u0101r\u012b, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101s\u012b. The v\u0101k, or Vedic injunctions, give directions for all these divisions. Everyone is expected to offer obeisances to the Supreme Lord and perform duties as indicated in the Vedas."

As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one who is situated in the devotional service of the Lord is transcendental to all the material qualities. Therefore the Lord personally says that no one can understand Him but the bhaktas, who are transcendental to all material qualities (bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti). As stated by Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.9.16): \u201cO King, no one can know the plan of the Lord [\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a]. Even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered.\u201d No one, therefore, can understand God by speculative knowledge. Indeed, by speculation one will be bewildered (muhyanti). This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.3): Among many thousands of men, one may endeavor for perfection, and even among the siddhas, those who have already become perfect, only one who adopts the process of bhakti, devotional service, can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

The Supersoul is acting at every moment, but the living entity cannot understand the form and activities of the Supersoul by manipulating his senses. The example of the eyes and the bodily limbs is very appropriate. If the limbs could see, they could walk forward without the help of the eyes, but that is impossible. Although one cannot see the Supersoul in one\u2019s heart through sensual activities, His direction is necessary."

They did not know, however, that the Vedic literature contains ritualistic ceremonies that are not transcendental, but are meant to keep peace and order among materialistic persons in the material world. Real religious principles are nistraigu\u1e47ya, above the three modes of material nature, or transcendental. The Yamad\u016btas did not know these transcendental religious principles, and therefore when prevented from arresting Aj\u0101mila they were surprised. Materialistic persons who attach all their faith to the Vedic rituals are described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.42), wherein K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, veda-v\u0101da-rat\u0101\u1e25 p\u0101rtha n\u0101nyad ast\u012bti v\u0101dina\u1e25: the supposed followers of the Vedas say that there is nothing beyond the Vedic ceremonies.

Those who do not know this principle but who simply attach their faith to the Vedic rituals are called veda-v\u0101da-rat\u0101\u1e25.

That is the real religious principle everyone should follow. Even though one follows Vedic scriptures, one may not know this transcendental principle, for it is not known to everyone. To say nothing of human beings, even the demigods in the upper planetary systems are unaware of it. This transcendental religious principle must be understood from the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly or from His special representative, as stated in the next verses."

My dear servants, this transcendental religious principle, which is known as bh\u0101gavata-dharma, or surrender unto the Supreme Lord and love for Him, is uncontaminated by the material modes of nature. It is very confidential and difficult for ordinary human beings to understand, but if by chance one fortunately understands it, he is immediately liberated, and thus he returns home, back to Godhead.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a refers to bh\u0101gavata-dharma as the most confidential religious principle (sarva-guhyatamam, guhy\u0101d guhyataram). K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says to Arjuna, \u201cBecause you are My very dear friend, I am explaining to you the most confidential religion.\u201d Sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: \u201cGive up all other duties and surrender unto Me.\u201d One may ask, \u201cIf this principle is very rarely understood, what is the use of it?\u201d In answer, Yamar\u0101ja states herein that this religious principle is understandable if one follows the parampar\u0101 system of Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, the four Kum\u0101ras and the other standard authorities. There are four lines of disciplic succession: one from Lord Brahm\u0101, one from Lord \u015aiva, one from Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the goddess of fortune, and one from the Kum\u0101ras. The disciplic succession from Lord Brahm\u0101 is called the Brahma samprad\u0101ya, the succession from Lord \u015aiva (\u015aambhu) is called the Rudra samprad\u0101ya, the one from the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b, is called the \u015ar\u012b samprad\u0101ya, and the one from the Kum\u0101ras is called the Kum\u0101ra samprad\u0101ya. One must take shelter of one of these four samprad\u0101yas in order to understand the most confidential religious system. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said, samprad\u0101ya-vih\u012bn\u0101 ye mantr\u0101s te ni\u1e63phal\u0101 mat\u0101\u1e25: if one does not follow the four recognized disciplic successions, his mantra or initiation is useless. In the present day there are many apasamprad\u0101yas, or samprad\u0101yas which are not bona fide, which have no link to authorities like Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, the Kum\u0101ras or Lak\u1e63m\u012b. People are misguided by such samprad\u0101yas. The \u015b\u0101stras say that being initiated in such a samprad\u0101ya is a useless waste of time, for it will never enable one to understand the real religious principles."

What are these principles? The Bh\u0101gavatam says, dharma\u1e25 projjhita-kaitavo\u00a0\u2019tra: in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam there are no cheating religious systems. Everything in the Bh\u0101gavatam is directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Bh\u0101gavatam further says, sa vai pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41 paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok\u1e63aje: the supreme religion is that which teaches its followers how to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the reach of experimental knowledge. Such a religious system begins with tan-n\u0101ma-graha\u1e47a, chanting of the holy name of the Lord (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam). After chanting the holy name of the Lord and dancing in ecstasy, one gradually sees the form of the Lord, the pastimes of the Lord and the transcendental qualities of the Lord. This way one fully understands the situation of the Personality of Godhead. One can come to this understanding of the Lord, how He descends into the material world, how He takes His births and what activities He performs, but one can know this only by executing devotional service. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti: simply by devotional service one can understand everything about the Supreme Lord. If one fortunately understands the Supreme Lord in this way, the result is tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti: after giving up his material body, he no longer has to take birth in this material world. Instead, he returns home, back to Godhead. That is the ultimate perfection. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.15): \u201cAfter attaining Me, the great souls, who are yog\u012bs in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.\u201d"

Aj\u0101mila, for example, was extremely sinful, but while dying he merely chanted the holy name, and although calling his son, he achieved complete liberation because he remembered the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a.",
        "purport": " In the assembly of Raghun\u0101tha d\u0101sa Gosv\u0101m\u012b\u2019s father, Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura confirmed that simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord one is liberated, even if he does not chant completely inoffensively. Sm\u0101rta-br\u0101hma\u1e47as and M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs do not believe that one can achieve liberation in this way, but the truth of Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura\u2019s statement is supported by many quotations from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. In his commentary on this verse, for example, \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b gives the following quotation: \u201cIf one always chants the holy name of the Lord with great devotion in the evening and in the morning, one can become free from all material miseries.\u201d Another quotation confirms that one can achieve liberation if one hears the holy name of the Lord constantly, every day with great respect (anudinam idam \u0101dare\u1e47a \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47van). Another quotation says: \u201cOne should always chant and hear about the extraordinarily wonderful activities of the Lord, one should meditate upon these activities, and one should endeavor to please the Lord.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.3.27) \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b also quotes from the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, p\u0101pa-k\u1e63aya\u015b ca bhavati smarat\u0101\u1e41 tam ahar-ni\u015bam: \u201cOne can become free from all sinful reactions simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Lord day and night [ahar-ni\u015bam].\u201d Furthermore, he quotes from Bh\u0101gavatam (6.3.31): All these quotations prove that one who constantly engages in chanting and hearing of the holy activities, name, fame and form of the Lord is liberated. As stated wonderfully in this verse, et\u0101vat\u0101lam agha-nirhara\u1e47\u0101ya pu\u1e41s\u0101m: simply by uttering the name of the Lord, one is freed from all sinful reactions. The word alam, which is used in this verse, indicates that simply uttering the holy name of the Lord is sufficient. This word is used with different imports. As stated in the Amara-ko\u015ba, the most authorized dictionary in the Sanskrit language, ala\u1e41 bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a-pary\u0101pti-\u015bakti-v\u0101ra\u1e47a-v\u0101cakam: the word alam is used to mean \u201cornament,\u201d \u201csufficiency,\u201d \u201cpower\u201d and \u201crestraint.\u201d Here the word alam is used to indicate that there is no need of any other process, for the chanting of the holy name of the Lord is sufficient. Even if one chants imperfectly, one becomes free from all sinful reactions by chanting. This power of chanting the holy name was proved by the liberation of Aj\u0101mila. When Aj\u0101mila chanted the holy name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, he did not precisely remember the Supreme Lord; instead, he remembered his own son. At the time of death, Aj\u0101mila certainly was not very clean; indeed, he was famous as a great sinner. Furthermore, one\u2019s physiological condition is completely disturbed at the time of death, and in such an awkward condition it would certainly have been very difficult for Aj\u0101mila to have chanted clearly. Nevertheless, Aj\u0101mila achieved liberation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Therefore, what is to be said of those who are not sinful like Aj\u0101mila? It is to be concluded that with a strong vow one should chant the holy name of the Lord \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 for thus one will certainly be delivered from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101 by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra is recommended even for persons who commit offenses, because if they continue chanting they will gradually chant offenselessly. By chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra without offenses, one increases his love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, prem\u0101 pumartho mah\u0101n: one\u2019s main concern should be to increase one\u2019s attachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to increase one\u2019s love for Him. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura quotes the following verse from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.19.24): \u201cMy dear Uddhava, the supreme religious system for human society is that by which one can awaken his dormant love for Me.\u201d Commenting on this verse, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura describes the word bhakti by saying premaivokta\u1e25. Ka\u1e25 anya\u1e25 artha\u1e25 asya: in the presence of bhakti, what is the necessity of liberation? \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also quotes this verse from the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: Even if in the beginning one chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra with offenses, one will become free from such offenses by chanting again and again. P\u0101pa-k\u1e63aya\u015b ca bhavati smarat\u0101\u1e41 tam ahar-ni\u015bam: one becomes free from all sinful reactions if one chants day and night, following the recommendation of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu.

They cannot understand the transcendental value of performing devotional service or chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. Because their minds are attracted to the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas \u2014 especially the Yajur Veda, S\u0101ma Veda and \u1e5ag Veda \u2014 their intelligence has become dull. Thus they are busy collecting the ingredients for ritualistic ceremonies that yield only temporary benefits, such as elevation to Svargaloka for material happiness. They are not attracted to the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement; instead, they are interested in dharma, artha, k\u0101ma and mok\u1e63a.",
        "purport": " Since one may easily achieve the highest success by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one may ask why there are so many Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and why people are attracted to them. This verse answers that question. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: the real purpose of studying the Vedas is to approach the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Unfortunately, unintelligent people bewildered by the grandeur of Vedic yaj\u00f1as want to see gorgeous sacrifices performed. They want Vedic mantras chanted and huge amounts of money spent for such ceremonies. Sometimes we have to observe the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies to please such unintelligent men. Recently, when we established a large K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-Balar\u0101ma temple in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, we were obliged to have Vedic ceremonies enacted by br\u0101hma\u1e47as because the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, especially the sm\u0101rta-br\u0101hma\u1e47as, would not accept Europeans and Americans as bona fide br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Thus we had to engage br\u0101hma\u1e47as to perform costly yaj\u00f1as. In spite of these yaj\u00f1as, the members of our Society performed sa\u1e45k\u012brtana loudly with m\u1e5bda\u1e45gas, and I considered the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana more important than the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Both the ceremonies and the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana were going on simultaneously. The ceremonies were meant for persons interested in Vedic rituals for elevation to heavenly planets (ja\u1e0d\u012b-k\u1e5bta-matir madhu-pu\u1e63pit\u0101y\u0101m), whereas the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana was meant for pure devotees interested in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We would simply have performed sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, but then the inhabitants of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana would not have taken the installation ceremony seriously. As explained here, the Vedic performances are meant for those whose intelligence has been dulled by the flowery language of the Vedas, which describe fruitive activities intended to elevate one to the higher planets. Especially in this Age of Kali, sa\u1e45k\u012brtana alone is sufficient. If the members of our temples in the different parts of the world simply continue sa\u1e45k\u012brtana before the Deity, especially before \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, they will remain perfect. There is no need of any other performances. Nevertheless, to keep oneself clean in habits and mind, Deity worship and other regulative principles are required. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that although sa\u1e45k\u012brtana is sufficient for the perfection of life, the arcan\u0101, or worship of the Deity in the temple, must continue in order that the devotees may stay clean and pure. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore recommended that one follow both processes simultaneously. We strictly follow his principle of performing Deity worship and sa\u1e45k\u012brtana along parallel lines. This we should continue."

Therefore this verse spoken by Yamar\u0101ja says, eva\u1e41 vim\u1e5b\u015bya sudhiyo bhagavati: those who engage in the loving service of the Lord become sudhiya\u1e25, intelligent, but this is not so of a Vedic scholar who does not understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, fame and qualities. A pure devotee is one whose intelligence is clear; he is truly thoughtful because he engages in the service of the Lord \u2014 not as a matter of show, but with love, with his mind, words and body. Nondevotees may make a show of religion, but it is not very effective because although they ostentatiously attend a temple or church, they are thinking of something else. Such persons are neglecting their religious duty and are punishable by Yamar\u0101ja. But a devotee who commits sinful acts, which he may do unwillingly or accidentally because of his former habits, is excused. That is the value of the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement."

Devotees are not liable to punishment by Yamar\u0101ja, but persons who have no information of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be protected by their material life of so-called family enjoyment. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam says (2.1.4): Such persons complacently believe that their nations, communities or families can protect them, unaware that all such fallible soldiers will be destroyed in due course of time. In conclusion, one should try to associate with persons who engage in devotional service twenty-four hours a day."

Var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma is also meant for that purpose. As stated in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (3.8.9): Human society is meant to follow strictly the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, which divides society into four social divisions (br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra) and four spiritual divisions (brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa). Var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma easily brings one nearer to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is the only true objective in human society. Na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um: unfortunately, however, people do not know that their self-interest is to return home, back to Godhead, or to approach Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Dur\u0101\u015bay\u0101 ye bahir-artha-m\u0101nina\u1e25: instead, they are simply bewildered. Every human being is expected to perform duties meant for approaching Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore Yamar\u0101ja advises the Yamad\u016btas to bring him those persons who have forgotten their duties toward Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (ak\u1e5bta-vi\u1e63\u1e47u-k\u1e5bty\u0101n). One who does not chant the holy name of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), who does not bow down to the Deity of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and who does not remember the lotus feet of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is punishable by Yamar\u0101ja. In summary, all avai\u1e63\u1e47avas, persons unconcerned with Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, are punishable by Yamar\u0101ja."

Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a states: Even if one chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra offensively, one can avoid offenses by continuously chanting without deviation. One who becomes accustomed to this practice will always remain in a pure transcendental position, untouchable by sinful reactions. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b especially requested King Par\u012bk\u1e63it to note this fact very carefully. There is no profit, however, in executing the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. By performing such activities one may go to the higher planetary systems, but as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.21), k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti: when the period of one\u2019s enjoyment in the heavenly planets is terminated because of the limited extent of the results of one\u2019s pious activities, one must return to earth. Thus there is no use in endeavoring to travel up and down in the universe. It is better to chant the holy name of the Lord so that one may become fully purified and eligible to return home, back to Godhead. That is the aim of life, and that is the perfection of life."

Persons who are attached to the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, but do not believe in devotional service, who advise atonement, but do not appreciate the chanting of the Lord\u2019s holy name, fail to achieve the highest perfection. Devotees, therefore, being completely detached from material enjoyment, never give up K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for Vedic ritualistic ceremonies.
