According to the results of a living entity\u2019s fruitive actions, he is forced to enter the material elements in different types of bodies. This time the living entity was supposed to have been the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Citraketu and Queen K\u1e5btadyuti because according to the laws of nature he had entered a body made by the King and Queen. Actually, however, he was not their son. The living entity is the son of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because he wants to enjoy this material world, the Supreme Lord gives him a chance to enter various bodies. The living entity has no true relationship with the material body he gets from his material father and mother. He is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but he is allowed to go through different bodies. The body created by the so-called father and mother actually has nothing to do with its so-called creators. Therefore the living entity flatly denied that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Citraketu and his wife were his father and mother."

        "purport": " It has already been explained that Citraketu\u2019s son was his enemy in a past life and had now appeared as his son just to give him more severe pain. Indeed, the untimely death of the son caused severe lamentation for the father. One may put forward the argument, \u201cIf the King\u2019s son was his enemy, how could the King have so much affection for him?\u201d In answer, the example is given that when someone\u2019s wealth falls into the hands of his enemy, the money becomes the enemy\u2019s friend. Then the enemy can use it for his own purposes. Indeed, he can even use it to harm its previous owner. Therefore the money belongs neither to the one party nor to the other. The money is always money, but in different situations it can be used as an enemy or a friend. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, it is not by any father or mother that the living entity is given his birth. The living entity is a completely separate identity from the so-called father and mother. By the laws of nature, the living entity is forced to enter the semen of a father and be injected into the womb of the mother. He is not in control of selecting what kind of father he will accept. Prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni: the laws of nature force him to go to different fathers and mothers, just like a consumer commodity that is purchased and sold. Therefore the so-called relationship of father and son is an arrangement of prak\u1e5bti, or nature. It has no meaning, and therefore it is called illusion. The same living entity sometimes takes shelter of an animal father and mother and sometimes a human father and mother. Sometimes he accepts a father and mother among the birds, and sometimes he accepts a demigod father and mother. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore says: Harassed life after life by the laws of nature, the living entity wanders throughout the entire universe in different planets and different species of life. Somehow or other, if he is fortunate enough, he comes in touch with a devotee who reforms his entire life. Then the living entity goes back home, back to Godhead. Therefore it is said: In the transmigration of the soul through different bodies, everyone, in every form of life \u2014 be it human, animal, tree or demigod \u2014 gets a father and mother. This is not very difficult. The difficulty is to obtain a bona fide spiritual master and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore the duty of a human being is to capture the opportunity to come in touch with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s representative, the bona fide spiritual master. Under the guidance of the spiritual master, the spiritual father, one can return home, back to Godhead."

The living entity, however, is permanent. As an animal is transferred from one owner to another, the living entity who was the son of Citraketu lived as his son for some time, but as soon as he was transferred to another body, the affectionate relationship was broken. As stated in the example given in the previous verse, when one has a commodity in his hands he considers it his, but as soon as it is transferred it becomes someone else\u2019s commodity.

The living entity is eternal (nitya) like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the difference is that the Supreme Lord is the greatest, no one being equal to or greater than Him, whereas the living entity is s\u016bk\u1e63ma, or extremely small. The \u015b\u0101stra describes that the magnitude of the living entity is one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair. The Supreme Lord is all-pervading (a\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham). Relatively, if the living entity is accepted as the smallest, there should naturally be inquiry about the greatest. The greatest is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the smallest is the living entity. Another peculiar characteristic of the j\u012bva is that he becomes covered by m\u0101y\u0101. \u0100tmam\u0101y\u0101-gu\u1e47ai\u1e25: he is prone to being covered by the Supreme Lord\u2019s illusory energy. The living entity is responsible for his conditional life in the material world, and therefore he is described as prabhu (\u201cthe master\u201d). If he likes he can come to this material world, and if he likes he can return home, back to Godhead. Because he wanted to enjoy this material world, the Supreme Personality of Godhead gave him a material body through the agency of the material energy. As the Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61): \u201cThe Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.\u201d The Supreme Lord gives the living entity a chance to enjoy in this material world as he desires, but He openly expresses His own desire that the living entity give up all material aspirations, fully surrender unto Him and return home, back to Godhead. The living entity is the smallest (s\u016bk\u1e63ma). J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says in this connection that the living entity within the body is extremely difficult for materialistic scientists to find, although we understand from authorities that the living entity is within the body. The body is different from the living entity."

For the Supreme Lord there are no friends, enemies or relatives, for He is completely free from all the disqualifications of ignorance that characterize the conditioned souls. On the other hand, He is extremely kind and favorable to His devotees, and He is not at all satisfied with persons who are envious of His devotees. As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.29): \u201cI envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.\u201d The Supreme Lord has no enemy or friend, but He is inclined toward a devotee who always engages in His devotional service. Similarly, elsewhere in the G\u012bt\u0101 (16.19) the Lord says: \u201cThose who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.\u201d The Lord is extremely antagonistic toward those who are envious of His devotees. To protect His devotees, the Lord sometimes has to kill their enemies. For example, to protect Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the Lord had to kill his enemy Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, although Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu attained salvation because of being killed by the Lord. Since the Lord is the witness of everyone\u2019s activities, He witnesses the actions of the enemies of His devotees, and He is inclined to punish them. In other cases, however, He simply witnesses what the living entities do and gives the results of one\u2019s sinful or pious actions."

        "purport": " In this verse the word b\u0101la-haty\u0101-hata-prabh\u0101\u1e25 is to be particularly noted. The practice of killing children has existed in human society for a long time \u2014 since time immemorial \u2014 but in the days of yore it was very rarely performed. At the present moment, however, in this Age of Kali, abortion \u2014 killing of the child within the womb \u2014 has become very common, and sometimes a child is even killed after birth. If a woman performs such an abominable act, she gradually loses all her bodily luster (b\u0101la-haty\u0101-hata-prabh\u0101\u1e25). It is also to be noted that the ladies who had committed the sinful act of administering poison to the child were very much ashamed, and according to the directions of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, they had to undergo atonement for killing the child. Any woman who has ever performed such an infamously sinful act must atone for it, but no one now is doing that. Under the circumstances, the women responsible must suffer in this life and the next. Those who are sincere souls, after hearing this incident, should refrain from such child-killing and should atone for their sinful activities by taking to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness very seriously. If one chants the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra without offenses, all of one\u2019s sinful actions are surely atoned for immediately, but one should not commit such deeds again, for that is an offense."

        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that He is pra\u1e47ava\u1e25 sarva-vede\u1e63u, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras. In transcendental knowledge, the Lord is addressed as pra\u1e47ava, o\u1e41k\u0101ra, which is a symbolic representation of the Lord in sound. O\u1e41 namo bhagavate v\u0101sudev\u0101ya. V\u0101sudeva, who is an expansion of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, expands Himself as Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. From Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a comes a second N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a expansion, and from this N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a come further expansions of V\u0101sudeva, Pradyumna, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a and Aniruddha. The Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a in this group is the original cause of the three puru\u1e63as, namely K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is situated in every universe in a special planet called \u015avetadv\u012bpa. This is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: a\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha. The word a\u1e47\u1e0da means this universe. Within this universe is a planet called \u015avetadv\u012bpa, where K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is situated. From Him come all the incarnations within this universe. As confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, all these forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are advaita, nondifferent, and they are also acyuta, infallible; they do not fall down like the conditioned souls. The ordinary living entity is prone to falling into the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, but the Supreme Lord in His different incarnations and forms is acyuta, infallible. Therefore His body is different from the material body possessed by the conditioned soul. The word m\u0101tr\u0101 is explained in the Medin\u012b dictionary as follows: m\u0101tr\u0101 kar\u1e47a-vibh\u016b\u1e63\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 vitte m\u0101ne paricchade. The word m\u0101tr\u0101, in its different imports, is used to indicate the decoration of the ear, possession, respect, and the possession of a covering. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14): \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\u201d In the conditioned state of life, the body is used as our dress, and as one needs different dresses during the summer and winter, we conditioned souls are changing bodies according to our desires. However, because the body of the Supreme Lord is full of knowledge, it needs no covering. The idea that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is like ours \u2014 in other words, that His body and soul are different \u2014 is a misunderstanding. There are no such differences for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because His body is full of knowledge. Here we receive material bodies because of a lack of knowledge, but because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, is full of knowledge, there is no difference between His body and His soul. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembers what He said forty million years ago to the sun-god, but an ordinary being cannot remember what he said the day before yesterday. This is the difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body and our body. Therefore the Lord is addressed as vij\u00f1\u0101na-m\u0101tr\u0101ya param\u0101nanda-m\u016brtaye. Because the Lord\u2019s body is full of knowledge, He always enjoys transcendental bliss. Indeed, His very form is param\u0101nanda. This is confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra: \u0101nandamayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t. By nature the Lord is \u0101nandamaya. Whenever we see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He is always full of \u0101nanda in all circumstances. No one can make Him morose. \u0100tm\u0101r\u0101m\u0101ya: He does not need to search for external enjoyment, because He is self-sufficient. \u015a\u0101nt\u0101ya: He has no anxiety. One who has to seek pleasure from other sources is always full of anxiety. Karm\u012bs, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs are full of anxiety because they want something, but a devotee does not want anything; he is simply satisfied in the service of the Lord, who is fully blissful. Niv\u1e5btta-dvaita-d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6daye: in our conditioned life our bodies have different parts, but although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a apparently has different bodily parts, no part of His body is different from any other part. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can see with His eyes, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can see without His eyes. Therefore in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad it is said, pa\u015byaty acak\u1e63u\u1e25. He can see with His hands and legs. He does not need a particular bodily part to perform a particular action. A\u1e45g\u0101ni yasya sakalendriya-v\u1e5bttimanti: He can do anything He desires with any part of His body, and therefore He is called almighty."

The Lord\u2019s body is transcendental, spiritual, but because the conditioned soul has a material body, he has many bodily and mental troubles. The conditioned soul is always perturbed by attachment and detachment, whereas the Supreme Lord is always free from such dualities. The Lord is the supreme master of all the senses, whereas the conditioned soul is controlled by the senses. The Lord is the greatest, whereas the living entity is the smallest. The living entity is conditioned by the waves of material nature, but the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all actions and reactions. The expansions of the Supreme Lord\u2019s body are innumerable (advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam), but the conditioned soul is limited to only one form. From history we learn that a conditioned soul, by mystic power, can sometimes expand into eight forms, but the Lord\u2019s bodily expansions are unlimited. This means that the bodies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no beginning and no end, unlike the bodies of the living entities."

        "purport": " Red-hot iron can burn, but it cannot burn the original fire. Therefore the consciousness of the small particle of Brahman is fully dependent on the power of the Supreme Brahman. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca: \u201cFrom Me the conditioned soul receives memory, knowledge and forgetfulness.\u201d The power for activities comes from the Supreme Lord, and when the Lord withdraws this power, the conditioned soul no longer has energy with which to act through his various senses. The body includes five knowledge-acquiring senses, five active senses and the mind, but actually these are merely lumps of matter. For example, the brain is nothing but matter, but when electrified by the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the brain can act, just as iron can burn when made red-hot by the influence of fire. The brain can act while we are awake or even while we are dreaming, but when we are fast asleep or unconscious the brain is inactive. Since the brain is a lump of matter, it does not have independent power with which to act. It can act only when favored by the influence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is Brahman or Parabrahman. This is the way to understand how the Supreme Brahman, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is present everywhere, just as the sunshine is present because of the sun-god in the sun globe. The Supreme Lord is called H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba; He is the only conductor of the senses. Unless empowered by His energy, our senses cannot act. In other words, He is the only seer, the only worker, the only listener, and the only active principle or supreme controller."

O King Par\u012bk\u1e63it, N\u0101rada then left with the great sage A\u1e45gir\u0101 for the topmost planet, known as Brahmaloka.",
        "purport": " When A\u1e45gir\u0101 had first come to visit King Citraketu, he did not bring N\u0101rada with him. However, after the death of Citraketu\u2019s son, A\u1e45gir\u0101 brought N\u0101rada to instruct King Citraketu about bhakti-yoga. The difference was that in the beginning Citraketu was not in a temperament of renunciation, but after the death of his son, when he was overwhelmed by his great plight, he was awakened to the platform of renunciation by instructions regarding the falsity of this material world and material possessions. It is only at this stage that bhakti-yoga can be instructed. As long as one is attached to material enjoyment, bhakti-yoga cannot be understood. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.44): \u201cIn the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination of devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place.\u201d As long as one is very much attached to material enjoyment, one cannot concentrate his mind on the subject matter of devotional service. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is progressing successfully in the Western countries at the present moment because the youth in the West have reached the stage of vair\u0101gya, or renunciation. They are practically disgusted with material pleasure from material sources, and this has resulted in a population of hippies throughout the Western countries. Now if these young people are instructed about bhakti-yoga, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the instructions will certainly be effective. As soon as Citraketu understood the philosophy of vair\u0101gya-vidy\u0101, the knowledge of renunciation, he could understand the process of bhakti-yoga. In this regard \u015ar\u012bla S\u0101rvabhauma Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101c\u0101rya has said, vair\u0101gya-vidy\u0101-nija-bhakti-yoga. Vair\u0101gya-vidy\u0101 and bhakti-yoga are parallel lines. One is essential for understanding the other. It is also said, bhakti\u1e25 pare\u015b\u0101nubhavo viraktir anyatra ca (Bh\u0101g. 11.2.42). Advancement in devotional service, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is characterized by increasing renunciation of material enjoyment. N\u0101rada Muni is the father of devotional service, and therefore, just to bestow causeless mercy upon King Citraketu, A\u1e45gir\u0101 brought N\u0101rada Muni to instruct the King. These instructions were extremely effective. Anyone who follows in the footsteps of N\u0101rada Muni is certainly a pure devotee."

        "purport": " A devotee\u2019s ultimate achievement is to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord in any one of the planets in the spiritual sky. As a result of rigid execution of devotional service, a devotee receives all material opulences if these are required; otherwise, the devotee is not interested in material opulences, nor does the Supreme Lord award them. When a devotee is actually engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, his apparently material opulences are not material; they are all spiritual. For example, if a devotee spends money to construct a beautiful and costly temple, the construction is not material but spiritual (nirbandha\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sambandhe yukta\u1e41 vair\u0101gyam ucyate). A devotee\u2019s mind is never diverted to the material side of the temple. The bricks, stone and wood used in the construction of the temple are spiritual, just as the Deity, although made of stone, is not stone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. The more one advances in spiritual consciousness, the more he can understand the elements of devotional service. Nothing in devotional service is material; everything is spiritual. Consequently a devotee is awarded so-called material opulence for spiritual advancement. This opulence is an aid to help the devotee advance toward the spiritual kingdom. Thus Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Citraketu remained in material opulence as a vidy\u0101dhara-pati, master of the Vidy\u0101dharas, and by executing devotional service he became perfect within a very few days and returned home, back to Godhead, taking shelter of the lotus feet of Lord \u015ae\u1e63a, Ananta. A karm\u012b\u2019s material opulence and a devotee\u2019s material opulence are not on the same level. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya comments in this way: By worshiping Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u one can get whatever he desires, but a pure devotee never asks Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u for any material profit. Instead he serves Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u without material desires and is therefore ultimately transferred to the spiritual kingdom. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla V\u012brar\u0101ghava \u0100c\u0101rya comments, yathe\u1e63\u1e6da-gatir ity artha\u1e25: by worshiping Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, a devotee can get whatever he likes. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Citraketu wanted only to return home, back to Godhead, and therefore he achieved success in that way."

They can keep You under their control because You are causelessly merciful to devotees who desire no material profit from You. Indeed, You give Yourself to them, and because of this You also have full control over Your devotees.",
        "purport": " The Lord and the devotees both conquer. The Lord is conquered by the devotees, and the devotees are conquered by the Lord. Because of being conquered by one another, they both derive transcendental bliss from their relationship. The highest perfection of this mutual conquering is exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the gop\u012bs. The gop\u012bs conquered K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conquered the gop\u012bs. Thus whenever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a played His flute, He conquered the minds of the gop\u012bs, and without seeing the gop\u012bs K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could not be happy. Other transcendentalists, such as j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs, cannot conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead; only pure devotees can conquer Him. Pure devotees are described as sama-mati, which means that they never deviate from devotional service under any circumstances. It is not that devotees worship the Supreme Lord only when happy; they worship Him even when in distress. Happiness and distress do not hamper the process of devotional service. Therefore \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam says that devotional service is ahaituky apratihat\u0101, unmotivated and uninterrupted. When a devotee offers devotional service to the Lord without any motive (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam, his service cannot be hampered by any material condition (apratihat\u0101). Thus a devotee who offers service in all conditions of life can conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A special distinction between devotees and the other transcendentalists, namely the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs, is that j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs artificially try to become one with the Supreme, whereas devotees never aspire for such an impossible accomplishment. Devotees know that their position is to be eternally servants of the Supreme Lord and never to be one with Him. Therefore they are called sama-mati or jit\u0101tm\u0101. They detest oneness with the Supreme. They have no lusty desires for oneness; instead, their desire is to be freed from all material hankering. Therefore they are called ni\u1e63k\u0101ma, desireless. A living entity cannot exist without desires, but desires that can never be fulfilled are called k\u0101ma, lusty desires. K\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25: because of lusty desires, nondevotees are deprived of their intelligence. Thus they are unable to conquer the Supreme Lord, whereas devotees, being freed from such unreasonable desires, can conquer the Lord. Such devotees are also conquered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they are pure, being free from all material desires, they fully surrender to the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Lord conquers them. Such devotees never aspire for liberation. They simply desire to serve the lotus feet of the Lord. Because they serve the Lord without desires for remuneration, they can conquer the mercy of the Lord. The Lord is by nature very merciful, and when He sees that His servant is working without desires for material profit, naturally He is conquered. Devotees are always engaged in service. All the activities of their senses are engaged in the service of the Lord. Because of such devotion, the Lord gives Himself to His devotees as if they could use Him for any purpose they might desire. Of course, devotees have no purpose other than to serve. When a devotee fully surrenders and has no aspiration for material profit, the Lord certainly gives him all opportunities for service. This is the position of the Lord when conquered by His devotees."

In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7) the Lord says, mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25: \u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.\u201d The living entities are nothing but very small portions of the supreme spirit, like sparks of a fire. Because they are part of the Supreme, they have a creative quality in a very minute quantity. The so-called scientists of the modern materialistic world are proud because they have created modern facilities like great airplanes, but the credit for creating the airplanes should go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not to the scientists who have invented or created the so-called wonderful products. The first consideration is the intelligence of the scientist; one must be elevated by the dictation of the Supreme Lord, who says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca: \u201cFrom Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\u201d Because the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul, sits within the core of every living entity\u2019s heart, the dictation by which one advances in scientific knowledge or creative faculties comes from Him. Furthermore, the ingredients to manufacture wonderful machines like airplanes are also supplied by the Lord, not by the scientists. Before the airplane was created, its ingredients already existed, having been caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when the manifested creation of the airplane is ruined, the remaining debris is a problem for the so-called creators. Another example is that the West is creating many automobiles. The ingredients for these cars are supplied, of course, by the Supreme Lord, and the intelligence for the so-called creation is also supplied by the Lord. Ultimately, when the cars are demolished, the so-called creators are faced with the problem of what to do with their ingredients. The actual creator, the original creator, is the Personality of Godhead. Only in the interim does someone create something with intelligence supplied by the Lord, and later the creation again becomes a problem. Therefore the so-called creator is not to be credited with the act of creation; the only credit goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is rightly stated herein that the credit for all the opulences of creation, maintenance and annihilation belongs to the Supreme Lord, not to the living entities."

Nonetheless, You are eternal, having no beginning, end or middle. You are perceived to exist in these three phases, and thus You are permanent. When the cosmic manifestation does not exist, You exist as the original potency.",
        "purport": " The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.33) says: \u201cI worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is the original person \u2014 absolute, infallible, without beginning, although expanded into unlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot be understood even by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no cause, for He is the cause of everything. The Lord is beyond the workings of cause and effect. He is eternally existing. In another verse the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 says, a\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham: the Lord exists within the gigantic universe and within the atom. The descent of the Lord into the atom and the universe indicates that without His presence, nothing could factually exist. Scientists say that water is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, but when they see a vast ocean they are puzzled about where such a quantity of hydrogen and oxygen could have come from. They think that everything evolved from chemicals, but where did the chemicals come from? That they do not know. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, He can produce immense quantities of chemicals to create a situation for chemical evolution. We actually see that chemicals are produced from living entities. For example, a lemon tree produces many tons of citric acid. The citric acid is not the cause of the tree; rather, the tree is the cause of the acid. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of everything. He is the cause of the tree that produces the citric acid (b\u012bja\u1e41 m\u0101\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m). Devotees can see that the original potencies causing the cosmic manifestation are not in chemicals but in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He is the cause of the chemicals. Everything is caused or manifested by the energy of the Supreme Lord, and when everything is annihilated or dissolved, the original potency enters the body of the Supreme Lord. Therefore this verse says, \u0101d\u0101v ante\u00a0\u2019pi ca sattv\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 yad dhruva\u1e41 tad ev\u0101ntar\u0101le\u00a0\u2019pi. The word dhruvam means \u201cpermanent.\u201d The permanent reality is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not this cosmic manifestation. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m and matta\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 pravartate: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original cause of everything. Arjuna recognized Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the original person (puru\u1e63a\u1e41 \u015b\u0101\u015bvata\u1e41 divyam \u0101di-devam aja\u1e41 vibhum), and the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 describes Him as the original person (govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63am). He is the cause of all causes, whether at the beginning, at the end or in the middle."

While He sleeps in that ocean, millions of universes are generated as He exhales, and they are all annihilated when He inhales. This Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is a plenary portion of a portion of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Govinda (yasya kal\u0101-vi\u015be\u1e63a\u1e25). The word kal\u0101 refers to a plenary portion of a plenary portion. From K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Govinda, comes Balar\u0101ma; from Balar\u0101ma comes Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a; from Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; from N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the second Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a; from the second Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; from Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; and from Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u controls every universe. This gives an idea of the meaning of ananta, unlimited. What is to be said of the unlimited potency and existence of the Lord? This verse describes the coverings of the universe (saptabhir da\u015ba-gu\u1e47ottarair a\u1e47\u1e0da-ko\u015ba\u1e25). The first covering is earth, the second is water, the third is fire, the fourth is air, the fifth is sky, the sixth is the total material energy, and the seventh is the false ego. Beginning with the covering of earth, each covering is ten times greater than the previous one. Thus we can only imagine how great each universe is, and there are many millions of universes. As confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.42): \u201cBut what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.\u201d The entire material world manifests only one fourth of the Supreme Lord\u2019s energy. Therefore He is called ananta."

When they are instructed by the Lord Himself about bh\u0101gavata-dharma and they adopt it, that is victory for the Lord, for He then reclaims these fallen souls. A devotee following the principles of bh\u0101gavata-dharma feels very much obligated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He can understand the difference between life without bh\u0101gavata-dharma and life with bh\u0101gavata-dharma and thus he ever remains obliged to the Lord. Taking to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and bringing fallen souls to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is victory for Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u201cThe supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.6) Therefore \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the pure transcendental process of religion."

There are other, low-class religious systems, which are contemplated for the killing of enemies or the gain of mystic power, but such religious systems, being full of passion and envy, are impure and temporary. Because they are full of envy, they are full of irreligion.",
        "purport": " Bh\u0101gavata-dharma has no contradictions. Conceptions of \u201cyour religion\u201d and \u201cmy religion\u201d are completely absent from bh\u0101gavata-dharma. Bh\u0101gavata-dharma means following the orders given by the Supreme Lord, Bhagav\u0101n, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. God is one, and God is for everyone. Therefore everyone must surrender to God. That is the pure conception of religion. Whatever God orders constitutes religion (dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam). In bh\u0101gavata-dharma there is no question of \u201cwhat you believe\u201d and \u201cwhat I believe.\u201d Everyone must believe in the Supreme Lord and carry out His orders. \u0100nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu\u015b\u012blanam: whatever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says \u2014 whatever God says \u2014 should be directly carried out. That is dharma, religion. If one is actually K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he cannot have any enemies. Since his only engagement is to induce others to surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God, how can he have enemies? If one advocates the Hindu religion, the Muslim religion, the Christian religion, this religion or that religion, there will be conflicts. History shows that the followers of religious systems without a clear conception of God have fought with one another. There are many instances of this in human history, but systems of religion that do not concentrate upon service to the Supreme are temporary and cannot last for long because they are full of envy. There are many activities directed against such religious systems, and therefore one must give up the idea of \u201cmy belief\u201d and \u201cyour belief.\u201d Everyone should believe in God and surrender unto Him. That is bh\u0101gavata-dharma. Bh\u0101gavata-dharma is not a concocted sectarian belief, for it entails research to find how everything is connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam). According to the Vedic injunctions, sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma: Brahman, the Supreme, is present in everything. Bh\u0101gavata-dharma captures this presence of the Supreme. Bh\u0101gavata-dharma does not consider everything in the world to be false. Because everything emanates from the Supreme, nothing can be false. Everything has some use in the service of the Supreme. For example, we are now dictating into a microphone and recording on a dictating machine, and thus we are finding how the machine can be connected to the Supreme Brahman. Since we are using this machine in the service of the Lord, it is Brahman. This is the meaning of sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma. Everything is Brahman because everything can be used for the service of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is mithy\u0101, false; everything is factual. Bh\u0101gavata-dharma is called sarvotk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, the best of all religious systems, because those who follow bh\u0101gavata-dharma are not envious of anyone. Pure bh\u0101gavatas, pure devotees, invite everyone, without envy, to join the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. A devotee is therefore exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m: he is the friend of all living entities. Therefore this is the best of all religious systems. Whereas so-called religions are meant for a particular type of person who believes in a particular way, such discrimination has no place in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or bh\u0101gavata-dharma. If we scrutinize the religious systems meant for worship of demigods or anyone else but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will find that they are full of envy and therefore impure."

        "purport": " Any religious system but the process of bh\u0101gavata-dharma \u2014 service as an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 is a system of envy of one\u2019s own self and of others. For example, there are many systems of religion in which animal sacrifices are recommended. Such animal sacrifices are inauspicious both for the performer and for the animal. Although one is sometimes permitted to sacrifice an animal before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b and eat it instead of purchasing meat from a slaughterhouse, permission to eat meat after a sacrifice in the presence of the goddess K\u0101l\u012b is not the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is simply a concession for the miserable person who will not give up eating meat. It is meant to restrict his desire for unrestricted meat-eating. Such a religious system is condemned. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: \u201cGive up all other duties and surrender unto Me.\u201d That is the last word in religion. One may argue that the sacrifice of animals is recommended in the Vedas. This recommendation, however, is a restriction. Without Vedic restrictions on the purchase of meat, people will purchase meat from the market, which will be overflooded with meat shops, and slaughterhouses will increase. To restrict this, sometimes the Vedas say that one may eat meat after sacrificing an insignificant animal like a goat before the goddess K\u0101l\u012b. In any case, a system of religion in which animal sacrifices are recommended is inauspicious for those who perform the sacrifices and for the animals. Envious persons who perform ostentatious animal sacrifices are condemned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.17) as follows: \u201cSelf-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes perform sacrifices in name only without following any rules or regulations.\u201d Sometimes animal sacrifices are performed very gorgeously with grand arrangements for worshiping the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, but such festivals, although performed in the name of yaj\u00f1a, are not actually yaj\u00f1a, for yaj\u00f1a means to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore it is recommended that in this age specifically, yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25: those who have good intelligence satisfy the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra. Envious persons, however, are condemned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as follows: \u201cBewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own body and in the bodies of others, and blasphemes against the real religion. Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.\u201d (Bg. 16.18-19) These persons are condemned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as indicated by the words tava kopa\u1e25. A person who commits murder is envious of himself and also the person he has killed, for the result of committing murder is that he will be arrested and hanged. If one transgresses the laws of a man-made government, he may escape being killed by the state, but one cannot escape the laws of God. A killer of any animal must be killed in his next life by the same animal. This is the law of nature. One must follow the instructions of the Supreme Lord: sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. If one follows any other system of religion, he is subject to punishment by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in many different ways. Therefore if one follows a concocted system of religion, he is envious not only of others but also of himself. Consequently his system of religion is useless. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.8) says: \u201cDuties (dharma) executed by men, regardless of occupation, are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Supreme Lord.\u201d Following a system of religion that does not awaken one\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or God consciousness, is merely a waste of time and labor."

        "purport": " Bh\u0101gavata-dharma and k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-kath\u0101 are identical. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu wanted everyone to become a guru and preach the instructions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra and similar Vedic literatures. \u0100ryans, who are advanced in civilization, follow bh\u0101gavata-dharma. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, although merely a child of five years, recommended: Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja preached bh\u0101gavata-dharma among his classmates as soon as an opportunity was afforded by the absence of his teachers from the classroom. He said that from the very beginning of life, from the age of five, children should be instructed about bh\u0101gavata-dharma because the human form of life, which is very rarely obtained, is meant for understanding this subject. Bh\u0101gavata-dharma means living according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we find that the Supreme Lord has arranged human society in four social divisions, namely br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra. Again, the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and other Vedic literatures set forth four \u0101\u015bramas, which are the divisions of spiritual life. Therefore bh\u0101gavata-dharma means the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma of the four social and four spiritual divisions. The members of human society who strictly follow the principles of bh\u0101gavata-dharma and live according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are called \u0100ryans or \u0101rya. A civilization of \u0100ryans who strictly follow the instructions of the Lord and never deviate from those instructions is perfect. Such civilized men do not discriminate between trees, animals, human beings and other living entities. Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25 sama-dar\u015bina\u1e25: because they are completely educated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, they see all living beings equally. \u0100ryans do not kill even a small plant unnecessarily, not to speak of cutting trees for sense gratification. At the present moment, throughout the world, killing is prominent. Men are killing trees, they are killing animals, and they are killing other human beings also, all for sense gratification. This is not an \u0100ryan civilization. As stated here, sthira-cara-sattva-kadambe\u1e63v ap\u1e5bthag-dhiya\u1e25. The word ap\u1e5bthag-dhiya\u1e25 indicates that \u0100ryans do not distinguish between lower and higher grades of life. All life should be protected. All living beings have a right to live, even the trees and plants. This is the basic principle of an \u0100ryan civilization. Apart from the lower living entities, those who have come to the platform of human civilization should be divided into a society of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as should follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and other Vedic literatures. The criterion must be gu\u1e47a and karma. In other words, one should acquire the qualities of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra and act accordingly. This is the civilization accepted by the \u0100ryans. Why do they accept it? They accept it because they are very much eager to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is perfect civilization. \u0100ryans do not deviate from the instructions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor do they have doubts about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but non-\u0100ryans and other demoniac people fail to follow the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. This is because they have been trained in sense gratification at the cost of all other living entities. N\u016bna\u1e41 pramatta\u1e25 kurute vikarma: their only business is to indulge in all kinds of forbidden activities for sense gratification. Yad indriya-pr\u012btaya \u0101p\u1e5b\u1e47oti: they deviate in this way because they want to gratify their senses. They have no other occupation or ambition. Their method of civilization is condemned in the previous verse. Ka\u1e25 k\u1e63emo nija-parayo\u1e25 kiy\u0101n v\u0101rtha\u1e25 sva-para-druh\u0101 dharme\u1e47a: \u201cWhat is the meaning of a civilization that kills oneself and others?\u201d This verse, therefore, advises that everyone become a member of the \u0100ryan civilization and accept the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should conduct his social, political and religious affairs according to His instructions. We are spreading the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement to try to establish a society the way that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants it. This is the meaning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We are therefore presenting Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is and kicking out all kinds of mental concoction. Fools and rascals interpret Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in their own way. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru \u2014 \u201cAlways think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto Me\u201d \u2014 they comment that it is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to whom we must surrender. Thus they derive imaginary meanings from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, however, strictly follows bh\u0101gavata-dharma, the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam for the complete welfare of human society. One who misinterprets Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, twisting out some meaning for his sense gratification, is a non-\u0100ryan. Therefore commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by such persons should be immediately rejected. One should try to follow Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (12.6-7) Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says: \u201cFor one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, for him I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death.\u201d"

Therefore, in this Age of Kali, when all people are very contaminated, the chanting of the holy name of the Lord is recommended as the only means of improvement. \u201cIn this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.\u201d (B\u1e5bhan-n\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a) \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu introduced this chanting of the holy name five hundred years ago, and now through the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement, we are actually seeing that men who are considered to belong to the lowest class are being delivered from all sinful activities simply by hearing the holy name of the Lord. Sa\u1e41s\u0101ra, material existence, is a result of sinful actions. Everyone in this material world is condemned, yet as there are different grades of prisoners, there are different grades of men. All of them, in all statuses of life, are suffering. To stop the suffering of material existence, one must take to the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious life. Herein it is said, yan-n\u0101ma sak\u1e5bc chrava\u1e47\u0101t: the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so powerful that if once heard without offenses, it can purify the lowest of men (kir\u0101ta-h\u016b\u1e47\u0101ndhra-pulinda-pulka\u015b\u0101\u1e25). Such men, who are called ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las, are less than \u015b\u016bdras, but they also can be purified simply by hearing the holy name of the Lord, not to speak of personally seeing the Lord. From our present position, the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be personally seen as the Deity in the temple. The Deity of the Lord is not different from the Supreme Lord. Because we cannot see the Supreme Lord with our present blunt eyes, the Lord has kindly consented to come before us in a form we can see. Therefore the Deity in the temple should not be considered material. By offering food to the Deity and by decorating and serving the Deity, one gets the same result that one derives from serving the Lord personally in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha."

        "purport": " The science of devotional service has been instructed by N\u0101rada and A\u1e45gir\u0101 to Citraketu. Now, because of Citraketu\u2019s devotional service, he has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By performing devotional service, one advances step by step, and when one is on the platform of love of Godhead (prem\u0101 pumartho mah\u0101n) he sees the Supreme Lord at every moment. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, when one engages in devotional service twenty-four hours a day (te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 satata-yukt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 bhajat\u0101\u1e41 pr\u012bti-p\u016brvakam) in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master, his devotional service becomes more and more pleasing. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is within the core of everyone\u2019s heart, speaks to the devotee (dad\u0101mi buddhi-yoga\u1e41 ta\u1e41 yena m\u0101m upay\u0101nti te). Citraketu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was first instructed by his gurus, A\u1e45gir\u0101 and N\u0101rada, and now, having followed their instructions, he has come to the stage of seeing the Supreme Lord face to face. Therefore the Lord is now instructing him in the essence of knowledge. The essence of knowledge is that there are two kinds of vastu, or substances. One is real, and the other, being illusory or temporary, is sometimes called nonfactual. One must consider these two kinds of existence. The real tattva, or truth, consists of Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.11): \u201cLearned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 or Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d The Absolute Truth exists eternally in three features. Therefore, Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n combined are the substance. The categories of emanations from the nonsubstance are two \u2014 activities and forbidden activities (karma and vikarma). Karma refers to the pious life or material activities performed during the day and the mental activities of dreams at night. These are more or less desired activities. Vikarma, however, refers to illusory activities, which are something like the will-o\u2019-the-wisp. These are activities that have no meaning. For example, modern scientists imagine that life can be produced from chemical combinations, and they are very busy trying to prove this in laboratories throughout the world, although no one in history has been able to produce the substance of life from material combinations. Such activities are called vikarma. All material activities are actually illusory, and progress in illusion is simply a waste of time. These illusory activities are called ak\u0101rya, and one must learn of them from the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.17): \u201cThe intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should know properly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is.\u201d One must learn of these directly from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who, as Anantadeva, is instructing King Citraketu because of the advanced stage of devotional service he achieved by following the instructions of N\u0101rada and A\u1e45gir\u0101. Herein it is said, aha\u1e41 vai sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni: the Lord is everything (sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni), including the living entities and the material or physical elements. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.4-5): \u201cEarth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego \u2014 all together these eight comprise My separated material energies. Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of the living entities, who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.\u201d The living entity tries to lord it over the material or physical elements, but both the physical elements and the spiritual spark are energies emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says, aha\u1e41 vai sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni: \u201cI am everything.\u201d Just as heat and light emanate from fire, these two energies \u2014 the physical elements and the living entities \u2014 emanate from the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Lord says, aha\u1e41 vai sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni: \u201cI expand the physical and spiritual categories.\u201d Again, the Lord, as the Supersoul, guides the living entities who are conditioned by the physical atmosphere. Therefore he is called bh\u016bt\u0101tm\u0101 bh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana\u1e25. He gives the living entity the intelligence with which to improve his position so that he may return home, back to Godhead, or if he does not want to go back to Godhead, the Lord gives him the intelligence with which to improve his material position. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15). Sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6do matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca: \u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\u201d From within, the Lord gives the living being the intelligence with which to work. Therefore the previous verse said that after the Supreme Personality of Godhead endeavors, our endeavors begin. We cannot independently endeavor or act upon anything. Therefore the Lord is bh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana\u1e25. Another specific feature of the knowledge given in this verse is that \u015babda-brahma is also a form of the Supreme Lord. In His eternal, blissful form, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is accepted by Arjuna as para\u1e41 brahma. A living entity in the conditioned stage accepts something illusory as substantial. This is called m\u0101y\u0101 or avidy\u0101 \u2014 ignorance. Therefore according to the Vedic knowledge, one must become a devotee, and one must then distinguish between avidy\u0101 and vidy\u0101, which are elaborately explained in the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad. When one is actually on the platform of vidy\u0101, he can personally understand the Personality of Godhead in His forms like those of Lord R\u0101ma, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. The Vedic knowledge is described as the breathing of the Supreme Lord, and activities begin on the basis of Vedic knowledge. Therefore the Lord says that when He endeavors or breathes, the material universes come into existence, and various activities gradually develop. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, pra\u1e47ava\u1e25 sarva-vede\u1e63u: \u201cI am the syllable om in all the Vedic mantras.\u201d Vedic knowledge begins with the vibration of the transcendental sound pra\u1e47ava, o\u1e41k\u0101ra. The same transcendental sound is Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Abhinnatv\u0101n n\u0101ma-n\u0101mino\u1e25: there is no difference between the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself."

        "purport": " The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy sees everything as being equal in quality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the Supreme Brahman, and therefore sees everything as worshipable. This dangerous theory of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da school has turned people in general toward atheism. On the strength of this theory, one thinks that he is God, but this is not a fact. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (may\u0101 tatam ida\u1e41 sarva\u1e41 jagad avyakta-m\u016brtin\u0101), the fact is that the entire cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the Supreme Lord\u2019s energies, which are manifested in the physical elements and the living entities. The living entities wrongly consider the physical elements to be resources meant for their enjoyment, and they think themselves to be the enjoyers. However, neither of them is independent; they are both energies of the Lord. The original cause for the material energy and spiritual energy is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, although the expansion of the Lord\u2019s energies is the original cause, one should not think that the Lord Himself has expanded in different ways. To condemn the theories of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, the Lord clearly says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, mat-sth\u0101ni sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni na c\u0101ha\u1e41 te\u1e63v avasthita\u1e25: \u201cAll beings are in Me, but I am not in them.\u201d Everything rests upon Him, and everything is but an expansion of His energies, but this does not mean that everything is as worshipable as the Lord Himself. The material expansion is temporary, but the Lord is not temporary. The living entities are parts of the Lord, but they are not the Lord Himself. The living entities in this material world are not inconceivable, but the Lord is. The theory that the Lord\u2019s energies, being expansions of the Lord, are as good as the Lord is mistaken."

        "translation": "When a person is in deep sleep, he dreams and sees in himself many other objects, such as great mountains and rivers or perhaps even the entire universe, although they are far away. Sometimes when one awakens from a dream he sees that he is in a human form, lying in his bed in one place. Then he sees himself, in terms of various conditions, as belonging to a particular nationality, family and so on. All the conditions of deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness are but energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should always remember the original creator of these conditions, the Supreme Lord, who is unaffected by them.",
        "purport": " None of these conditions of the living entities \u2014 namely, deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness \u2014 is substantial. They are simply displays of various phases of conditional life. There may be many mountains, rivers, trees, bees, tigers and snakes that are situated far away, but in a dream one may imagine them to be nearby. Similarly, as one has subtle dreams at night, when the living entity is awake he lives in gross dreams of nation, community, society, possessions, skyscrapers, bank balance, position and honor. Under the circumstances, one should know that his position is due to his contact with the material world. One is situated in different positions in various forms of life that are all but creations of the illusory energy, which works under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the ultimate actor, and the conditioned living entity should simply remember this original actor, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As living entities, we are being carried away by the waves of prak\u1e5bti, or nature, which works under the Lord\u2019s direction (may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram).

These are all creations of m\u0101y\u0101.\u201d Our only duty is to remember the supreme director of this illusory energy \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. For us to do this, the \u015b\u0101stra advises us, harer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101maiva kevalam: one should constantly chant the holy name of the Lord \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The Supreme Lord is realized in three different phases, as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n, but Bhagav\u0101n is the ultimate realization. One who realizes Bhagav\u0101n \u2014 the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 is the most perfect mah\u0101tm\u0101 (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25). In the human form of life, one should understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for then one will understand everything else. Yasmin vij\u00f1\u0101te sarvam eva\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 bhavati (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.3). According to this Vedic injunction, simply by understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one understands Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, prak\u1e5bti, the illusory energy, the spiritual energy and everything else. Everything will be revealed. Prak\u1e5bti, the material nature, is working under the direction of the Supreme Lord, and we living entities are being carried away by various phases of prak\u1e5bti. For self-realization, one should always remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated in Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, smartavya\u1e25 satata\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25: we should always remember Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vismartavyo na j\u0101tucit: we should never forget the Lord.

In other words, instead of identifying his interest with Mine, he becomes interested in his bodily expansions like his wife, children and material possessions. In this way, by the influence of his actions, one body comes from another, and after one death, another death takes place.",
        "purport": " Generally the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers or persons influenced by M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers think themselves as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the cause of their conditional life. As stated by the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava poet Jagad\u0101nanda Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita in his Prema-vivarta: As soon as a living entity forgets his constitutional position and endeavors to become one with the Supreme, his conditional life begins. The conception that the Supreme Brahman and the living entity are equal not only in quality but also in quantity is the cause of conditional life. If one forgets the difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entity, his conditional life begins. Conditional life means giving up one body to accept another and undergoing death to accept death again. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosopher teaches the philosophy of tat tvam asi, saying, \u201cYou are the same as God.\u201d He forgets that tat tvam asi applies in terms of the marginal position of the living entity, who is like sunshine. There is heat and light in the sun, and there is heat and light in the sunshine, and thus they are qualitatively one. But one should not forget that the sunshine rests on the sun. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham: \u201cI am the original source of Brahman.\u201d The sunshine is important because of the presence of the sun globe. It is not that the sun globe is important because of the all-pervasiveness of the sunshine. Forgetfulness and misunderstanding of this fact is called m\u0101y\u0101. Because of forgetfulness of one\u2019s constitutional position and that of the Supreme Lord, one comes into m\u0101y\u0101, or sa\u1e41s\u0101ra \u2014 conditional life. In this regard, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says: When one thinks that the living entity is nondifferent in all respects from the Supreme Lord, there is no doubt that he is in ignorance (tama\u1e25)."
