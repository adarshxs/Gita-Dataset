        "purport": " The misunderstanding of the conditioned soul is the bodily conception of life. The body is material, but within the body is the soul. This is spiritual understanding. Unfortunately, one who is in ignorance, under the spell of material illusion, accepts the body to be the self. He cannot understand that the body is matter. Like small particles of sand, bodies come together and are separated by the force of time, and people falsely lament for unification and separation. Unless one knows this, there is no question of happiness. Therefore in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.13) this is the first instruction given by the Lord: \u201cAs the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d We are not the body; we are spiritual beings trapped in the body. Our real interest lies in understanding this simple fact. Then we can make further spiritual progress. Otherwise, if we remain in the bodily conception of life, our miserable material existence will continue forever. Political adjustments, social welfare work, medical assistance and the other programs we have manufactured for peace and happiness will never endure. We shall have to undergo the sufferings of material life one after another. Therefore material life is said to be du\u1e25kh\u0101layam a\u015b\u0101\u015bvatam; it is a reservoir of miserable conditions."

Therefore although he married hundreds and thousands of wives, all of them proved barren, and he could not beget even one child. When A\u1e45gir\u0101 \u1e5a\u1e63i came to see the King, the King requested the great sage to enable him to have at least one son. Because of the blessing of A\u1e45gir\u0101 \u1e5a\u1e63i, a child was sent by the grace of m\u0101y\u0101, but the child was not to live for long. Therefore in the beginning A\u1e45gir\u0101 \u1e5a\u1e63i told the King that he would beget a child who would cause jubilation and lamentation. King Citraketu was not destined to get a child by providence, or the will of the Supreme. Just as sterile grain cannot produce more grain, a sterile person, by the will of the Supreme Lord, cannot beget a child. Sometimes a child is born even to an impotent father and sterile mother, and sometimes a potent father and fertile mother are childless. Indeed, sometimes a child is born despite contraceptive methods, and therefore the parents kill the child in the womb. In the present age, killing children in the womb has become a common practice. Why? When contraceptive methods are taken, why don\u2019t they act? Why is a child sometimes produced so that the father and mother have to kill it in the womb? We must conclude that our arrangement of so-called scientific knowledge cannot determine what will take place; what is enacted actually depends on the supreme will. It is by the supreme will that we are situated in certain conditions in terms of family, community and personality. These are all arrangements of the Supreme Lord according to our desires under the spell of m\u0101y\u0101, illusion. In devotional life, therefore, one should not desire anything, since everything depends on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.1.11): \u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\u201d One should act only to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For everything else, one should fully depend upon the Supreme Person. We should not create plans that will ultimately make us frustrated."

As an agent of the supreme doer, the Supreme Lord, one should abide by the Lord\u2019s orders. The present chaotic conditions of the world are due to the ignorance of leaders who forget that they have been appointed to act by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they have been appointed by the Lord, their duty is to consult the Lord and act accordingly. The book for consultation is Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, in which the Supreme Lord gives directions. Therefore those who are engaged in creation, maintenance and annihilation should consult the Supreme Person, who has appointed them, and should act accordingly. Then everyone will be satisfied, and there will be no disturbances."

Actually both the material and spiritual energies \u2014 matter and spirit \u2014 exist eternally as potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The potent entity is the Supreme Person. Since the spiritual energy, the living being, who is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, desires to enjoy this material world, the Lord gives him a chance to accept different types of material bodies and enjoy or suffer in different material conditions. Factually, the spiritual energy, the living entity who desires to enjoy material things, is manipulated by the Supreme Lord. The so-called father and mother have nothing to do with the living entity. As a result of his own choice and karma, the living being takes different bodies through the agency of so-called fathers and mothers."

You must certainly be among them.",
        "purport": " The word j\u00f1\u0101na-hetava\u1e25 is very significant because great personalities like those listed in these verses wander on the surface of the globe not to mislead the populace, but to distribute real knowledge. Without this knowledge, human life is wasted. The human form of life is meant for realization of one\u2019s relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God. One who lacks this knowledge is categorized among the animals. The Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.15): \u201cThose miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.\u201d Ignorance is the bodily conception of life (yasy\u0101tma-buddhi\u1e25 ku\u1e47ape tri-dh\u0101tuke \u2026 sa eva go-khara\u1e25). Practically everyone throughout the universe, especially on this planet, Bh\u016brloka, thinks that there is no separate existence of the body and soul and therefore no need of self-realization. But that is not a fact. Therefore all the br\u0101hma\u1e47as listed here, being devotees, travel all over the world to awaken K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the hearts of such foolish materialists. The \u0101c\u0101ryas mentioned in these verses are described in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The word pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha is also important. One who is liberated from the conceptions of annamaya, pr\u0101\u1e47amaya, manomaya, vij\u00f1\u0101namaya and \u0101nandamaya and who is perfectly aware of the subtle coverings of the soul is called pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha. According to the statements of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (S\u0101nti-parva, Chapters 218-219), an \u0101c\u0101rya named Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha took birth in the family of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Janaka, the ruler of Mithila. The S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophers accept Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikh\u0101c\u0101rya as one of them. Real knowledge pertains to the living entity dwelling within the body. Unfortunately, because of ignorance, the living entity identifies himself with the body and therefore feels pleasure and pain."

The guru should not be approached for material benefits. One should not approach a guru just to cure some disease or receive some miraculous benefit. This is not the way to approach the guru. Tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtham: one should approach the guru to understand the transcendental science of spiritual life.

These disciples are not interested in pursuing spiritual life to save themselves from the darkness of ignorance.

        "purport": " Several words in this verse are very important. The word mah\u0101-puru\u1e63a refers to advanced devotees and also to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mah\u0101 means \u201cthe supreme,\u201d and puru\u1e63a means \u201cperson.\u201d One who always engages in the service of the Supreme Lord is called mah\u0101-pauru\u1e63ika. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it are sometimes addressed as mah\u0101-pauru\u1e63ika. A devotee should always aspire to engage in the service of advanced devotees. As \u015ar\u012bla Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has sung: A devotee should always aspire to live in the association of advanced devotees and engage in the service of the Lord through the parampar\u0101 system. One should serve the mission of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu through the instructions of the great Gosv\u0101m\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. This is called t\u0101\u1e45dera cara\u1e47a sevi. While serving the lotus feet of the Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, one should live in the association of devotees (bhakta-sane v\u0101sa). This is the business of a devotee. A devotee should not aspire for material profit or lament for material loss. When A\u1e45gir\u0101 \u1e5a\u1e63i and N\u0101rada saw that Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Citraketu, an advanced devotee, had fallen in the darkness of ignorance and was lamenting for the material body of his son, by their causeless mercy they came to advise him so that he could be saved from this ignorance. Another significant word is brahma\u1e47ya. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sometimes addressed by the prayer namo brahma\u1e47ya-dev\u0101ya, which offers obeisances unto the Lord because He is served by the devotees. Therefore this verse states, brahma\u1e47yo bhagavad-bhakto n\u0101v\u0101s\u0101ditum arhasi. This is the symptom of an advanced devotee. Brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101. For a devotee \u2014 an advanced, self-realized soul \u2014 there is no cause for material jubilation or lamentation. He is always transcendental to conditional life."

One may think that these will give him protection, but that is impossible. In spite of all these possessions, the spirit soul has to give up his present situation and accept another. The next situation may be unfavorable, but even if it is favorable, one must give it up and again accept another body. In this way, one\u2019s tribulation in material existence continues. A sane man should be perfectly aware that these things will never be able to give him happiness. One must be situated in his spiritual identity and eternally serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a devotee.

According to our mental concoctions we work in various ways, desiring various achievements, and by nature and the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (karma\u1e47\u0101-daiva-netre\u1e47a) we get the advantages we desire.

Through the mind the living entity suffers three kinds of tribulations \u2014 adhibhautika, adhidaivika and adhy\u0101tmika. Therefore this body is a source of all miseries.",
        "purport": " In the Fifth Canto (5.5.4), while instructing his sons, \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva said, asann api kle\u015bada \u0101sa deha\u1e25: the body, although temporary, is the cause of all the miseries of material existence. As already discussed in the previous verse, the entire material creation is based on mental concoction. The mind sometimes induces us to think that if we purchase an automobile we can enjoy the physical elements, such as earth, water, air and fire, combined in forms of iron, plastic, petrol and so on. Working with the five material elements (pa\u00f1ca-bh\u016btas), as well as with our five knowledge-gathering senses like the eyes, ears and tongue and our five active senses like the hands and legs, we become involved in the material condition. Thus we are subjected to the tribulations known as adhy\u0101tmika, adhidaivika and adhibhautika. The mind is the center because the mind creates all these things. As soon as the material object is struck, however, the mind is affected, and we suffer. For example, with the material elements, the working senses and the knowledge-gathering senses we create a very nice car, and when the car is accidentally smashed in a collision, the mind suffers, and through the mind the living entity suffers. The fact is that the living entity, while concocting with the mind, creates the material condition. Because matter is destructible, through the material condition the living entity suffers. Otherwise, the living entity is detached from all material conditions. When one comes to the Brahman platform, the platform of spiritual life, fully understanding that he is a spiritual soul (aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi), he is no longer affected by lamentation or hankering. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): \u201cOne who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything.\u201d Elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7) the Lord says: \u201cThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\u201d The living entity is actually part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is unaffected by material conditions, but because the mind (mana\u1e25) is affected, the senses are affected, and the living entity struggles for existence within this material world."

        "translation": "Therefore, O King Citraketu, carefully consider the position of the \u0101tm\u0101. In other words, try to understand who you are \u2014 whether body, mind or soul. Consider where you have come from, where you are going after giving up this body, and why you are under the control of material lamentation. Try to understand your real position in this way, and then you will be able to give up your unnecessary attachment. You will also be able to give up the belief that this material world, or anything not directly in touch with service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is eternal. Thus you will obtain peace.",
        "purport": " The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is factually endeavoring to bring human society to a sober condition. Because of a misdirected civilization, people are jumping in materialistic life like cats and dogs, performing all sorts of abominable, sinful actions and becoming increasingly entangled. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement includes self-realization because one is first directed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to understand that one is not the body but the owner of the body. When one understands this simple fact, he can direct himself toward the goal of life. Because people are not educated in terms of the goal of life, they are working like madmen and becoming more and more attached to the material atmosphere. The misguided man accepts the material condition as everlasting. One must give up his faith in material things and give up attachment for them. Then one will be sober and peaceful."
