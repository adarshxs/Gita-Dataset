When man and woman unite, the hard knot of this attraction becomes increasingly tight, and thus a man is implicated in the materialistic way of life. This is the illusion of the material world. This illusion acted upon Ka\u015byapa Muni, although he was very learned and advanced in spiritual knowledge. As stated in the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (2.215) and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (9.19.17): \u201cA man should not associate with a woman in a solitary place, not even with his mother, sister or daughter, for the senses are so strong that they lead astray even a person advanced in knowledge.\u201d When a man remains in a solitary place with a woman, his sexual desires undoubtedly increase. Therefore the words ek\u0101nta-bh\u016bt\u0101ni, which are used here, indicate that to avoid sexual desires one should avoid the company of women as far as possible. Sexual desire is so powerful that one is saturated with it if he stays in a solitary place with any woman, even his mother, sister or daughter."

One who is not in direct touch with the Supreme Lord and cannot conceive of the exalted position of the Lord is sometimes advised to worship the demigods as various parts of the Lord. If women, who are usually very much attached to their husbands, worship their husbands as representatives of V\u0101sudeva, the women benefit, just as Aj\u0101mila benefited by calling for N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, his son. Aj\u0101mila was concerned with his son, but because of his attachment to the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, he attained salvation simply by chanting that name. In India a husband is still called pati-guru, the husband spiritual master. If husband and wife are attached to one another for advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, their relationship of cooperation is very effective for such advancement. Although the names of Indra and Agni are sometimes uttered in the Vedic mantras (indr\u0101ya sv\u0101h\u0101, agnaye sv\u0101h\u0101), the Vedic sacrifices are actually performed for the satisfaction of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. As long as one is very much attached to material sense gratification, the worship of the demigods or the worship of one\u2019s husband is recommended."

        "purport": " The natural instinct of a woman is to enjoy the material world. She induces her husband to enjoy this world by satisfying his tongue, belly and genitals, which are called jihv\u0101, udara and upastha. A woman is expert in cooking palatable dishes so that she can easily satisfy her husband in eating. When one eats nicely, his belly is satisfied, and as soon as the belly is satisfied the genitals become strong. Especially when a man is accustomed to eating meat and drinking wine and similar passionate things, he certainly becomes sexually inclined. It should be understood that sexual inclinations are meant not for spiritual progress but for gliding down to hell. Thus Ka\u015byapa Muni considered his situation and lamented. In other words, to be a householder is very risky unless one is trained and the wife is a follower of her husband. A husband should be trained at the very beginning of his life. Kaum\u0101ra \u0101caret pr\u0101j\u00f1o dharm\u0101n bh\u0101gavat\u0101n iha (Bh\u0101g. 7.6.1). During the time of brahmacarya, or student life, a brahmac\u0101r\u012b should be taught to be expert in bh\u0101gavata-dharma, devotional service. Then when he marries, if his wife is faithful to her husband and follows him in such life, the relationship between husband and wife is very desirable. However, a relationship between husband and wife without spiritual consciousness but strictly for sense gratification is not at all good. It is said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.2.3) that especially in this age, Kali-yuga, d\u0101m-patye\u00a0\u2019bhirucir hetu\u1e25: the relationship between husband and wife will be based on sexual power. Therefore householder life in this Kali-yuga is extremely dangerous unless both the wife and husband take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Her words are very sweet, and they give pleasure to the ear, but if we study a woman\u2019s heart, we can understand it to be extremely sharp, like the blade of a razor. In these circumstances, who could understand the dealings of a woman?",
        "purport": " Woman is now depicted very well from the materialistic point of view by Ka\u015byapa Muni. Women are generally known as the fair sex, and especially in youth, at the age of sixteen or seventeen, women are very attractive to men. Therefore a woman\u2019s face is compared to a blooming lotus flower in autumn. Just as a lotus is extremely beautiful in autumn, a woman at the threshold of youthful beauty is extremely attractive. In Sanskrit a woman\u2019s voice is called n\u0101r\u012b-svara because women generally sing and their singing is very attractive. At the present moment, cinema artists, especially female singers, are especially welcome. Some of them earn fabulous amounts of money simply by singing. Therefore, as taught by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, a woman\u2019s singing is dangerous because it can make a sanny\u0101s\u012b fall a victim to the woman. Sanny\u0101sa means giving up the company of women, but if a sanny\u0101s\u012b hears the voice of a woman and sees her beautiful face, he certainly becomes attracted and is sure to fall down. There have been many examples. Even the great sage Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra fell a victim to Menak\u0101. Therefore a person desiring to advance in spiritual consciousness must be especially careful not to see a woman\u2019s face or hear a woman\u2019s voice. To see a woman\u2019s face and appreciate its beauty or to hear a woman\u2019s voice and appreciate her singing as very nice is a subtle falldown for a brahmac\u0101r\u012b or sanny\u0101s\u012b. Thus the description of a woman\u2019s features by Ka\u015byapa Muni is very instructive. When a woman\u2019s bodily features are attractive, when her face is beautiful and when her voice is sweet, she is naturally a trap for a man. The \u015b\u0101stras advise that when such a woman comes to serve a man, she should be considered to be like a dark well covered by grass. In the fields there are many such wells, and a man who does not know about them drops through the grass and falls down. Thus there are many such instructions. Since the attraction of the material world is based on attraction for women, Ka\u015byapa Muni thought, \u201cUnder the circumstances, who can understand the heart of a woman?\u201d C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita has also advised, vi\u015bv\u0101so naiva kartavya\u1e25 str\u012b\u1e63u r\u0101ja-kule\u1e63u ca: \u201cThere are two persons one should not trust \u2014 a politician and a woman.\u201d These, of course, are authoritative \u015b\u0101stric injunctions, and we should therefore be very careful in our dealings with women. Sometimes our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is criticized for mingling men and women, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is meant for anyone. Whether one is a man or woman does not matter. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally says, striyo vai\u015by\u0101s tath\u0101 \u015b\u016bdr\u0101s te\u00a0\u2019pi y\u0101nti par\u0101\u1e41 gatim: whether one is a woman, \u015b\u016bdra or vai\u015bya, not to speak of being a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or k\u1e63atriya, everyone is fit to return home, back to Godhead, if he strictly follows the instructions of the spiritual master and \u015b\u0101stra. We therefore request all the members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement \u2014 both men and women \u2014 not to be attracted by bodily features but only to be attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then everything will be all right. Otherwise there will be danger."

        "translation": "To satisfy their own interests, women deal with men as if the men were most dear to them, but no one is actually dear to them. Women are supposed to be very saintly, but for their own interests they can kill even their husbands, sons or brothers, or cause them to be killed by others.",
        "purport": " A woman\u2019s nature has been particularly well studied by Ka\u015byapa Muni. Women are self-interested by nature, and therefore they should be protected by all means so that their natural inclination to be too self-interested will not be manifested. Women need to be protected by men. A woman should be cared for by her father in her childhood, by her husband in her youth and by her grown sons in her old age. This is the injunction of Manu, who says that a woman should not be given independence at any stage. Women must be cared for so that they will not be free to manifest their natural tendency for gross selfishness. There have been many cases, even in the present day, in which women have killed their husbands to take advantage of their insurance policies. This is not a criticism of women but a practical study of their nature. Such natural instincts of a woman or a man are manifested only in the bodily conception of life. When either a man or a woman is advanced in spiritual consciousness, the bodily conception of life practically vanishes. We should see all women as spiritual units (aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi), whose only duty is to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then the influences of the different modes of material nature, which result from one\u2019s possessing a material body, will not act. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is so beneficial that it can very easily counteract the contamination of material nature, which results from one\u2019s possessing a material body. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 therefore teaches, in the very beginning, that whether one is a man or a woman, one must know that he or she is not the body but a spiritual soul. Everyone should be interested in the activities of the spirit soul, not the body. As long as one is activated by the bodily conception of life, there is always the danger of being misled, whether one is a man or a woman. The soul is sometimes described as puru\u1e63a because whether one is dressed as a man or a woman, one is inclined to enjoy this material world. One who has this spirit of enjoyment is described as puru\u1e63a. Whether one is a man or a woman, he is not interested in serving others; everyone is interested in satisfying his or her own senses. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, provides first-class training for a man or a woman. A man should be trained to be a first-class devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and a woman should be trained to be a very chaste follower of her husband. That will make the lives of both of them happy."

I shall train her in such a way that instead of always thinking of how to kill Indra, she will become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If she agrees to follow the rules and regulations of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava principles, the unclean core of her heart will certainly be cleansed.\u201d Ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam. This is the process of devotional service. Anyone can be purified by following the principles of devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so powerful that it can purify even the dirtiest class of men and transform them into the topmost Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s movement aims at this purpose. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says: The appearance of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu in this Kali-yuga is especially meant to deliver the fallen souls, who are always planning something for material enjoyment. He gave the people of this age the advantage of being able to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and thus become fully pure, free from all material contamination. Once one becomes a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he transcends all material conceptions of life. Thus Ka\u015byapa Muni tried to transform his wife into a Vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u012b so that she might give up the idea of killing Indra. He wanted both her and her sons to be purified so that they would be fit to become pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Of course, sometimes a practitioner deviates from the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava principles, and there is a chance that he may fall down, but Ka\u015byapa Muni thought that even if one falls while practicing the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava principles, he is still not a loser. Even a fallen Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is eligible for better results, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t: even practicing the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava principles to a small extent can save one from the greatest danger of material existence. Thus Ka\u015byapa Muni planned to instruct his wife Diti to become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava because he wanted to save the life of Indra."

I promise that I shall do the needful and not break the vow.\u201d This is another side of a woman\u2019s psychology. Even though a woman is very fond of fulfilling her own plans, when someone instructs her, especially her husband, she innocently follows, and thus she can be trained for better purposes. By nature a woman wants to be a follower of a man; therefore if the man is good the woman can be trained for a good purpose."

The worship of the Supreme Lord is recommended, and the Lord is very fond of the cows and br\u0101hma\u1e47as (namo brahma\u1e47ya-dev\u0101ya go-br\u0101hma\u1e47a-hit\u0101ya ca). In other words, a civilization in which there is no respect for the cows and br\u0101hma\u1e47as is condemned. One cannot become spiritually advanced without acquiring the brahminical qualifications and giving protection to cows. Cow protection insures sufficient food prepared with milk, which is needed for an advanced civilization. One should not pollute civilization by eating the flesh of cows. A civilization must do something progressive, and then it is an \u0100ryan civilization. Instead of killing the cow to eat flesh, civilized men must prepare various milk products that will enhance the condition of society. If one follows the brahminical culture, he will become competent in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " When Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja saw Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he declined to take any benedictions from Him, for he was fully satisfied by seeing the Lord. Nonetheless, the Lord is so kind that because Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, in the beginning, had desired a kingdom greater than his father\u2019s, he was promoted to Dhruvaloka, the best planet in the universe. Therefore in the \u015b\u0101stra it is said: \u201cA person who has broader intelligence, whether he is full of material desires, free from material desires, or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.3.10) One should engage in full devotional service. Then, even though he has no desires, whatever desires he previously had can all be fulfilled simply by his worship of the Lord. The actual devotee does not desire even liberation (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam). The Lord, however, fulfills the desire of the devotee by awarding him opulence that will never be destroyed. A karm\u012b\u2019s opulence is destroyed, but the opulence of a devotee is never destroyed. A devotee becomes more and more opulent as he increases his devotional service to the Lord."
