        "purport": " In this regard, a very exalted example was set by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu and the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Concerning \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu it is said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.34): \u201cWe offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of the Lord, upon whom one should always meditate. He left His householder life, leaving aside His eternal consort, whom even the denizens of heaven adore. He went into the forest to deliver the fallen souls, who are put into illusion by material energy.\u201d To accept sanny\u0101sa means to commit civil suicide, but sanny\u0101sa is compulsory, at least for every br\u0101hma\u1e47a, every first-class human being. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu had a very young and beautiful wife and a very affectionate mother. Indeed, the affectionate dealings of His family members were so pleasing that even the demigods could not expect such happiness at home. Nevertheless, for the deliverance of all the fallen souls of the world, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu took sanny\u0101sa and left home when He was only twenty-four years old. He lived a very strict life as a sanny\u0101s\u012b, refusing all bodily comforts. Similarly, His disciples the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs were ministers who held exalted positions in society, but they also left everything to join the movement of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. \u015ar\u012bniv\u0101sa \u0100c\u0101rya says: These Gosv\u0101m\u012bs left their very comfortable lives as ministers, Zamindars and learned scholars and joined \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s movement, just to show mercy to the fallen souls of the world (d\u012bna-ga\u1e47e\u015bakau karu\u1e47ay\u0101). Accepting very humble lives as mendicants, wearing no more than loincloths and torn quilts (kaup\u012bna-kantha), they lived in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and followed \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s order to excavate V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana\u2019s lost glories. Similarly, everyone else with a materially comfortable condition in this world should join the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement to elevate the fallen souls. The words bh\u016bta-dayay\u0101, m\u0101y\u0101-m\u1e5bga\u1e41 dayitayepsitam and d\u012bna-ga\u1e47e\u015bakau karu\u1e47ay\u0101 all convey the same sense. These are very significant words for those interested in elevating human society to a proper understanding of life. One should join the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, following the examples of such great personalities as \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, the Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs and, before them, the great sage Dadh\u012bci. Instead of wasting one\u2019s life for temporary bodily comforts, one should always be prepared to give up one\u2019s life for better causes. After all, the body will be destroyed. Therefore one should sacrifice it for the glory of distributing religious principles throughout the world."

        "purport": " One generally follows different types of religious principles or performs various occupational duties according to the body given to him by the modes of material nature. In this verse, however, real religious principles are explained. Everyone should be unhappy to see others in distress and happy to see others happy. \u0100tmavat sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u: one should feel the happiness and distress of others as his own. It is on this basis that the Buddhist religious principle of nonviolence \u2014 ahi\u1e41sa\u1e25 parama-dharma\u1e25 \u2014 is established. We feel pain when someone disturbs us, and therefore we should not inflict pain upon other living beings. Lord Buddha\u2019s mission was to stop unnecessary animal killing, and therefore he preached that the greatest religious principle is nonviolence. One cannot continue killing animals and at the same time be a religious man. That is the greatest hypocrisy. Jesus Christ said, \u201cDo not kill,\u201d but hypocrites nevertheless maintain thousands of slaughterhouses while posing as Christians. Such hypocrisy is condemned in this verse. One should be happy to see others happy, and one should be unhappy to see others unhappy. This is the principle to be followed. Unfortunately, at the present moment so-called philanthropists and humanitarians advocate the happiness of humanity at the cost of the lives of poor animals. That is not recommended herein. This verse clearly says that one should be compassionate to all living entities. Regardless of whether human, animal, tree or plant, all living entities are sons of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.4): \u201cIt should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunt\u012b, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.\u201d The different forms of these living entities are only their external dresses. Every living being is actually a spirit soul, a part and parcel of God. Therefore one should not favor only one kind of living being. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sees all living entities as part and parcel of God. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.18 and 18.54): \u201cThe humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].\u201d \u201cOne who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\u201d A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, therefore, is truly a perfect person because he laments to see others unhappy and feels joy at seeing others happy. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is para-du\u1e25kha-du\u1e25kh\u012b; he is always unhappy to see the conditioned souls in an unhappy state of materialism. Therefore a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always busy preaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness throughout the world."

The word upakury\u0101t means para-upak\u0101ra, helping others. Of course, in human society there are many institutions to help others, but because philanthropists do not know how to help others, their propensity for philanthropy is ineffectual.

In this regard, one may refer to the incident of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s leaving his body, as described in the First Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.13.55). Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra analytically divided his gross material body into the five different elements of which it was made \u2014 earth, water, fire, air and ether \u2014 and distributed them to the different reservoirs of these elements; in other words, he merged these five elements into the original mahat-tattva. By identifying his material conception of life, he gradually separated his spirit soul from material connections and placed himself at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example given in this connection is that when an earthen pot is broken, the small portion of the sky within the pot is united with the large sky outside the pot. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers misunderstand this description of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Therefore \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nuja Sv\u0101m\u012b, in his book Ved\u0101nta-tattva-s\u0101ra, has described that this merging of the soul means that after separating himself from the material body made of eight elements \u2014 earth, water, fire, air, ether, false ego, mind and intelligence \u2014 the individual soul engages himself in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25/ an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am). The material cause of the material elements absorbs the material body, and the spiritual soul assumes its original position. As described by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, j\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa\u2019: the constitutional position of the living entity is that he is the eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When one overcomes the material body through cultivation of spiritual knowledge and devotional service, one can revive his own position and thus engage in the service of the Lord."

Similar advice was also given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Arjuna. \u201cMy dear Arjuna,\u201d the Lord said, \u201cdo not desist from fighting. If you gain victory in the fight, you will enjoy a kingdom, and even if you die you will be elevated to the heavenly planets.\u201d Everyone should be ready to die while performing glorious deeds. A glorious person is not meant to meet death like cats and dogs."
