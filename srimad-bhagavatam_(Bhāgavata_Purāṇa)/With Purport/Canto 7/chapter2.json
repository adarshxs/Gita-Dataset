Actually it is not possible for the Lord to be partial. Nonetheless, since the demigods, the devotees, always strictly follow the Supreme Lord\u2019s orders, because of sincerity they are victorious over the demons, who know that the Supreme Lord is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u but do not follow His instructions. Because of constantly remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the demons generally attain s\u0101yujya-mukti after death. The demon Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu accused the Lord of being partial because the demigods worshiped Him, but in fact the Lord, like the government, is not partial at all.

Although He is the Supreme Person, now, influenced by m\u0101y\u0101, He has assumed the form of a boar to please His devotees, the demigods, just as a restless child leans toward someone. I shall therefore sever Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s head from His trunk by my trident, and with the profuse blood from His body I shall please my brother Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a, who was so fond of sucking blood. Thus shall I too be peaceful.",
        "purport": " The defect of the demoniac mentality is expressed in this verse very clearly. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu thought that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u also becomes partial, like a child whose mind is not steady or resolute. The Lord can change His mind at any time, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu thought, and therefore His words and activities are like those of children. Actually, because the demons are ordinary human beings, their minds change, and being materially conditioned, they think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is conditioned also. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11), avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam: \u201cFools deride Me when I descend in a human form.\u201d Demons always think that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can be killed. Therefore, being absorbed in thoughts of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s form to kill Him, at least they have the opportunity to think of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u unfavorably. Although they are not devotees, their thinking of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is effective, and thus they generally attain s\u0101yujya-mukti. Because the demons consider the Supreme Lord an ordinary living being, they think that they can kill Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as one might kill an ordinary person. Another fact disclosed herein is that demons are very much fond of sucking blood. Indeed, all of them are meat-eaters and bloodsuckers. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu accused the Supreme Lord of having a restless mind like that of a small child who can be induced to do anything if simply offered some cakes and l\u0101\u1e0d\u1e0dus. Indirectly, this indicates the true position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26): \u201cIf one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.\u201d The Lord accepts the offerings of devotees because of their transcendental love. Because they are in love with the Supreme Lord, they do not eat anything without offering it first to the Lord. The Lord does not hanker for a small leaf or flower; He has enough to eat. Indeed, He is feeding all living entities. Nonetheless, because He is very merciful and is bhakta-vatsala, very favorable to the devotees, He certainly eats whatever they offer Him with love and devotion. This quality should not be misjudged to be childish. The highest quality of the Supreme Lord is that He is bhakta-vatsala; in other words, He is always extremely pleased with His devotees. As for the word m\u0101y\u0101, when used in reference to the dealings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees, this word means \u201caffection.\u201d The actions of the Lord to favor His devotees are not disqualifications but signs of His natural affection. As for rudhira, or the blood of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, since there is no possibility of severing Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s head from His body, there is no question of blood. But the garland that decorates Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s body is as red as blood. When the demons achieve s\u0101yujya-mukti and leave behind their sinful activities, they are blessed by Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s garland, which is red like blood. After attaining s\u0101yujya-mukti, the demons are sometimes promoted to the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha world, where they receive the reward of the Lord\u2019s garland pras\u0101da."

        "purport": " Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s main purpose was to disturb the demigods. He planned first to kill Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u so that with Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s death the demigods would automatically weaken and die. Another of his plans was to disturb the residents of the planet earth. The peace and prosperity of the residents of earth, and all the other planets, were maintained by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13), c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25: \u201cAccording to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.\u201d On all the planets there are different types of residents, but the Lord recommends, referring especially to the planet earth, which is inhabited by human beings, that society be divided into four var\u1e47as \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra. Before the advent of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on this earth, it is understood that the earth was managed by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas. The duty of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as is to cultivate \u015bama\u1e25 (peacefulness), dama\u1e25 (self-control), titik\u1e63\u0101 (tolerance), satyam (truthfulness), \u015baucam (cleanliness) and \u0101rjavam (simplicity), and then to advise the k\u1e63atriya kings how to rule the country or planet. Following the instructions of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the k\u1e63atriyas should engage the populace in austerity, sacrifices, Vedic study and adherence to the rules and regulations established by Vedic principles. They should also arrange for charity to be given to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, sanny\u0101s\u012bs and temples. This is the godly arrangement of brahminical culture. People are inclined to offer yaj\u00f1a because unless sacrifices are offered there will be insufficient rain (yaj\u00f1\u0101d bhavati parjanya\u1e25), which will hamper agricultural activities (parjany\u0101d anna-sambhava\u1e25). By introducing brahminical culture, therefore, a k\u1e63atriya government should engage people in performing yaj\u00f1a, studying the Vedas and giving charity. Thus the people will receive their necessities for life very easily, and there will be no disturbances in society. In this regard, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (3.12): \u201cIn charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the performance of yaj\u00f1a [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But he who enjoys these gifts, without offering them to the demigods in return, is certainly a thief.\u201d The demigods are authorized supplying agents who act on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the performance of prescribed yaj\u00f1as. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of yaj\u00f1as prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of yaj\u00f1as are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis \u2014 namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended. But for those in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is recommended. Ultimately, all yaj\u00f1as are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least five yaj\u00f1as, known as pa\u00f1ca-mah\u0101yaj\u00f1a, are necessary. One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can manufacture anything. Consider, for example, all the eatables of human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk and sugar for persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, such as meats, none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for example, heat, light, water and air, which are also necessities of life \u2014 none of them can be manufactured by human society. Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall or breeze, without which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependent on supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese and so many essentials \u2014 all of which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance of yaj\u00f1as. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy, for they have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yaj\u00f1as. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yaj\u00f1a, namely the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, which can be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu planned to kill the inhabitants of earth so that yaj\u00f1a would stop and the demigods, being disturbed, would die automatically when Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the yaj\u00f1e\u015bvara, was killed. These were the demoniac plans of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, who was expert in such activities."

When the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are killed, no one will exist to encourage the k\u1e63atriyas to perform yaj\u00f1as, and thus the demigods, not being appeased by yaj\u00f1a, will automatically die.",
        "purport": " Since Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the central point of brahminical culture, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s plan was to kill Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, for if Vi\u1e63\u1e47u were killed, naturally the brahminical culture would also be lost. With brahminical culture lost, yaj\u00f1a would no longer be performed, and for want of yaj\u00f1a the regular distribution of rainfall would cease (yaj\u00f1\u0101d bhavati parjanya\u1e25). Thus there would be disturbances all over the world, and naturally the demigods would be defeated. From this verse we get a clear indication of how human society is disturbed when the Vedic \u0100ryan civilization is killed and the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies performed by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are stopped. Kalau \u015b\u016bdra-sambhava\u1e25: because the population of the modern world consists mostly of \u015b\u016bdras, the brahminical culture is now lost and is extremely difficult to reestablish in a proper way. Therefore Lord Caitanya has recommended the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, which will revive brahminical culture very easily. Because of the increment in demoniac population, people have lost brahminical culture. Nor is there a k\u1e63atriya government. Instead, the government is a democracy in which any \u015b\u016bdra can be voted into taking up the governmental reigns and capture the power to rule. Because of the poisonous effects of Kali-yuga, the \u015b\u0101stra (Bh\u0101g. 12.2.13) says, dasyu-pr\u0101ye\u1e63u r\u0101jasu: the government will adopt the policies of dasyus, or plunderers. Thus there will be no instructions from the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and even if there are brahminical instructions, there will be no k\u1e63atriya rulers who can follow them. Aside from Satya-yuga, even formerly, in the days when demons were flourishing, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu planned to destroy the brahminical culture and the k\u1e63atriya government and thus create chaos all over the world. Although in Satya-yuga this plan was very difficult to execute, in Kali-yuga, which is full of \u015b\u016bdras and demons, the brahminical culture is lost and can be revived only by the chanting of the mah\u0101-mantra. Therefore the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, or the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement, has been inaugurated to revive brahminical culture very easily so that people may become happy and peaceful in this life and prepare for elevation in the next. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya quotes this verse from the Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a: \u201cO King, the demons think that Hari, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, exists because of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and yaj\u00f1a, but factually Hari is the cause of everything including the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and yaj\u00f1a.\u201d Therefore, through the popularizing of hari-k\u012brtana, or the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement, the brahminical culture and k\u1e63atriya government will automatically come back, and people will be extremely happy."

        "purport": " The picture of a proper human civilization is indirectly described here. In a perfect human civilization there must be a class of men fully trained as perfect br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Similarly, there must be k\u1e63atriyas to rule the country very nicely according to the injunctions of the \u015b\u0101stras, and there must be vai\u015byas who can protect the cows. The word g\u0101va\u1e25 indicates that cows should be given protection. Because the Vedic civilization is lost, cows are not protected, but instead indiscriminately killed in slaughterhouses. Such are the acts of demons. Therefore this is a demoniac civilization. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma mentioned here is essential for human civilization. Unless there is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a to guide, a k\u1e63atriya to rule perfectly, and a perfect vai\u015bya to produce food and protect the cows, how will people live peacefully? It is impossible. Another point is that trees also should be given protection. During its lifetime, a tree should not be cut for industrial enterprises. In Kali-yuga, trees are indiscriminately and unnecessarily cut for industry, in particular for paper mills that manufacture a profuse quantity of paper for the publication of demoniac propaganda, nonsensical literature, huge quantities of newspapers and many other paper products. This is a sign of a demoniac civilization. The cutting of trees is prohibited unless necessary for the service of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

The answer is that the paper mills should manufacture paper only for the publication of ISKCON literature because ISKCON literature is published for the service of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This literature clarifies our relationship with Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and therefore the publication of ISKCON literature is the performance of yaj\u00f1a. Yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25. Yaj\u00f1a must be performed, as indicated by the superior authorities. The cutting of trees simply to manufacture paper for the publication of unwanted literature is the greatest sinful act."

All the living entities in this material world have come here only because they wanted to be equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in enjoyment and have thus been sent here to be conditioned by material nature in different degrees. In the material world a so-called family is a combination of several persons in one home to fulfill the terms of their imprisonment. As criminal prisoners scatter as soon as their terms are over and they are released, all of us who have temporarily assembled as family members will continue to our respective destinations. Another example given is that family members are like straws carried together by the waves of a river. Sometimes such straws mix together in whirlpools, and later, dispersed again by the same waves, they float alone in the water. Although Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was a demon, he had Vedic knowledge and understanding. Thus the advice given to his family members \u2014 his sister-in-law, mother and nephews \u2014 was quite sound. The demons are considered highly elevated in knowledge, but because they do not use their good intelligence for the service of the Lord, they are called demons. The demigods, however, act very intelligently to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.13) as follows: \u201cO best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties [dharma] according to caste divisions and orders of life, is to please the Lord Hari.\u201d To become a demigod or to become godly, whatever one\u2019s occupation, one must satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "purport": " Sometimes, because of mental derangement, the land appears to be moving. A drunkard, for example, or a person with heart disease, sometimes feels that the land is moving. Similarly, the reflections of trees in a flowing river also appear to move. These are the actions of m\u0101y\u0101. Actually the living entity does not move (sth\u0101\u1e47ur acalo\u00a0\u2019yam). The living entity does not take birth or accept death, but because of the transient subtle and gross bodies, the living entity appears to move from one place to another or be dead and gone forever. As the great Bengali Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava poet, Jagad\u0101nanda Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, has said: According to this statement from the Prema-vivarta, when a living entity is conditioned by material nature, he is exactly like a person haunted by a ghost. One should therefore understand the fixed position of the spirit soul and how he is carried away by the waves of material nature to different bodies and different situations under lamentation and hankering. One achieves the success of life when he understands the constitutional position of his self and is undisturbed by the conditions created by material nature (prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 karm\u0101\u1e47i sarva\u015ba\u1e25)."

        "purport": " As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.84.13): \u201cA human being who identifies the body made of three elements as the self, who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the land of his birth worshipable, and who goes to a place of pilgrimage simply to bathe rather than to meet men of transcendental knowledge there, is to be considered like a cow or an ass.\u201d Although Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was a great demon, he was not as foolish as the population of the modern world. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu had clear knowledge of the spirit soul and the subtle and gross bodies, but now we are so degraded that everyone, including the exalted scientists, philosophers and other leaders, is under the bodily conception of life, which is condemned in the \u015b\u0101stras. Sa eva go-khara\u1e25: such persons are nothing but cows and asses. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu advised his family members that although the gross body of his brother Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a was dead and they were aggrieved because of this, they should not lament for the great soul of Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a, who had already attained his next destination. \u0100tm\u0101, the spirit soul, is always unchanged (avikala\u1e25 pum\u0101n). We are spirit souls, but when carried away by mental activities (manodharma), we suffer from so-called material conditions of life. This generally happens to nondevotees. Har\u0101v abhaktasya kuto mahad-gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e25: nondevotees may possess exalted material qualities, but because they are foolish they have no good qualifications. The designations of the conditioned soul in the material world are decorations of the dead body. The conditioned soul has no information of the spirit and its exalted existence beyond the effects of the material condition."

When P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the father of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, died, his two wives \u2014 namely, the mother of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Bh\u012bma and Arjuna and the mother of Nakula and Sahadeva \u2014 were both ready to die in the fire with their husband. Later, after a compromise was arranged, Kunt\u012b stayed alive to care for the little children, and the other wife, M\u0101dr\u012b, was allowed to die with her husband. This system of saha-m\u0101ra\u1e47a continued in India even until the time of British rule, but later it was discouraged, since the attitude of wives gradually changed with the advancement of Kali-yuga. Thus the system of saha-m\u0101ra\u1e47a has practically been abolished. Nevertheless, within the past fifty years I have seen the wife of a medical practitioner voluntarily accept death immediately when her husband died. Both the husband and wife were taken in procession in the mourning cart. Such intense love of a chaste wife for her husband is a special case."

        "purport": " According to the Vedic system, if a person dies during the daytime it is customary for his funeral ceremony to be performed before the sun sets, regardless of whether he is burned or buried, and if he dies at night the funeral must be completed before the next sunrise. Apparently the queens continued lamenting for the dead body, the lump of matter, and would not allow it to be taken away for burning. This illustrates the strong grip of illusion among foolish persons who consider the body the self. Women are generally considered less intelligent. Because of ignorance only, the queens thought of the dead body as their husband and somehow or other thought that if the body were kept their husband would remain with them. Such a conception of the self is certainly for go-khara \u2014 cows and asses. We have actually seen that sometimes when a cow\u2019s calf has died the milkman cheats the cow by presenting before her the dead body of her calf. Thus the cow, who would not otherwise allow milking, licks the dead body of the calf and allows herself to be milked. This substantiates the description of the \u015b\u0101stra that a foolish man in the bodily concept of life is like a cow. Not only do foolish men and women consider the body the self, but we have even seen that the dead body of a so-called yog\u012b was kept for days by his disciples, who thought that their guru was in sam\u0101dhi. When decomposition began and a bad smell unfortunately began to overwhelm the yogic power, the disciples allowed the dead body of the so-called yog\u012b to be burned. Thus the bodily concept of life is extremely strong among foolish persons, who are compared to cows and asses. Nowadays, great scientists are trying to freeze dead bodies so that in the future these frozen bodies may again be brought to life. The incident narrated by Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu from history must have taken place millions of years ago because Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu lived millions of years ago and was even then quoting from history. Thus the incident occurred before Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s lifetime, but the same ignorance in the bodily concept of life is still prevalent, not only among laymen but even among scientists who think they will be able to revive frozen corpses. Apparently the queens did not want to deliver the dead body for burning because they were afraid of dying with the dead body of their husband."

If a living being who has already left his body has been pious, Yamar\u0101ja, just to give him relief, will give him another body. Since the living being in the body of the King had some attachment to his body, he was hovering as a ghost, and therefore Yamar\u0101ja, as a special consideration, approached the lamenting relatives to instruct them personally. Yamar\u0101ja approached them as a child because a child is not restricted but is granted admittance anywhere, even to the palace of a king. Besides this, the child was speaking philosophy.

These persons, who are older than me, have full experience that hundreds and thousands of living entities have taken birth and died. Thus they should understand that they also are apt to die, yet still they are bewildered. The conditioned soul comes from an unknown place and returns after death to that same unknown place. There is no exception to this rule, which is conducted by material nature. Knowing this, why do they uselessly lament?",
        "purport": " The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.28): \u201cAll created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim state, and unmanifest again when they are annihilated. So what need is there for lamentation?\u201d Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the existence of the soul and the other not believing in its existence, there is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if for argument\u2019s sake we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. For example, a big skyscraper is manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in the course of time things are manifested and unmanifested \u2014 that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation, in either manifestation or unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and this does not make any real material difference. If we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (antavanta ime deh\u0101\u1e25) that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time (nityasyokt\u0101\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25) but that the soul is eternal, then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul or one does not believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata it is said, adar\u015ban\u0101d ih\u0101y\u0101ta\u1e25 puna\u015b c\u0101dar\u015bana\u1e41 gata\u1e25. This statement could support the theory of the atheistic scientist that the child in the womb of the mother has no life but is simply a lump of matter. To follow this theory, if the lump of matter is aborted by a surgical operation, no life is killed; the body of a child is like a tumor, and if a tumor is operated upon and thrown away, no sin is involved. The same argument could be put forward in regard to the King and his queens. The body of the King was manifested from an unmanifested source, and again it became unmanifested from manifestation. Since the manifestation exists only in the middle \u2014 between the two points of unmanifestation \u2014 why should one cry for the body manifested in the interim?"

        "purport": " Here it is very plainly explained that God is not responsible for the living entity\u2019s accepting different types of bodies. One has to accept a body according to the laws of nature and one\u2019s own karma. Therefore the Vedic injunction is that a person engaged in material activities should be given directions by which he can intelligently apply his activities to the service of the Lord to become free from the material bondage of repeated birth and death (sva-karma\u1e47\u0101 tam abhyarcya siddhi\u1e41 vindati m\u0101nava\u1e25). The Lord is always ready to give directions. Indeed, His directions are elaborately given in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. If we take advantage of these directions, then in spite of our being conditioned by the laws of material nature, we shall become free to attain our original constitution (m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te). We should have firm faith that the Lord is supreme and that if we surrender to Him, He will take charge of us and indicate how we can get out of material life and return home, back to Godhead. Without such surrender, one is obliged to accept a certain type of body according to his karma, sometimes as an animal, sometimes a demigod and so on. Although the body is obtained and lost in due course of time, the spirit soul does not actually mix with the body, but is subjugated by the particular modes of nature with which he is sinfully associated. Spiritual education changes one\u2019s consciousness so that one simply carries out the orders of the Supreme Lord and becomes free from the influence of the modes of material nature."

But although the eight gross and subtle material energies \u2014 namely, earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego \u2014 are stated to be bhinn\u0101, separate from the Lord, actually they are not. As fire appears separate from wood and as the air flowing through the nostrils and mouth of the body appear separate from the body, so the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears separate from the living being but is actually separate and not separate simultaneously. This is the philosophy of acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva propounded by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. According to the reactions of karma, the living being appears separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but actually he is very intimately related with the Lord. Consequently, even though we now seem neglected by the Lord, He is actually always alert to our activities. Under all circumstances, therefore, we should simply depend on the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus revive our intimate relationship with Him. We must depend upon the authority and control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

After death, when the breath within the nostrils has stopped, one can understand that the person within the body, who was hearing and replying, has now gone. Therefore, in effect, the common man concludes that actually the spirit soul was different from the body and has now gone away. Thus even a common man, coming to his senses, can know that the real person who was within the body and was hearing and replying was never seen. For that which was never seen, what is the need of lamentation?"

The soul can merely act in cooperation with the Supersoul because it is the Supersoul who gives him directions to act or not to act (matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca). One cannot act without His sanction, for the Supersoul is upadra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 and anumant\u0101, the witness and sanctioner. One who studies carefully, under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, can understand the real knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the conductor of all the activities of the individual soul, and the controller of their results as well. Although the individual soul possesses the indriyas, or senses, he is not actually the proprietor, for the proprietor is the Supersoul. Consequently the Supersoul is called H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, and the individual soul is advised by the direction of the Supersoul to surrender to Him and thus be happy (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). Thus he can become immortal and be transferred to the spiritual kingdom, where he will achieve the highest success of an eternal, blissful life of knowledge. In conclusion, the individual soul is different from the body, senses, living force and the airs within the body, and above him is the Supersoul, who gives the individual soul all facilities. The individual soul who renders everything to the Supersoul lives very happily within the body."

If a living being resists the dictation of the mind and engages the mind in the loving service of the Lord, the mind cannot degrade him. The duty of all human beings, therefore, is to keep the mind always engaged at the lotus feet of the Lord (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25).

When the mind wanders during the day and a man begins to think himself extremely important, or when he dreams at night and sees a beautiful woman enjoying with him, these are merely false dreams. Similarly, the happiness and distress caused by the material senses should be understood to be meaningless.",
        "purport": " The happiness and distress derived from the activities of the material senses are not actual happiness and distress. Therefore Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 speaks of happiness that is transcendental to the material conception of life (sukham \u0101tyantika\u1e41 yat tad buddhi-gr\u0101hyam at\u012bndriyam). When our senses are purified of material contamination, they become at\u012bndriya, transcendental senses, and when the transcendental senses are engaged in the service of the master of the senses, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, one can derive real transcendental pleasure. Whatever distress or happiness we manufacture by mental concoction through the subtle mind has no reality, but is simply a mental concoction. One should therefore not imagine so-called happiness through mental concoction. Rather, the best course is to engage the mind in the service of the Lord, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, and thus feel real blissful life. There is a Vedic statement ap\u0101ma-somam am\u1e5bt\u0101 abh\u016bma apsarobhir vihar\u0101ma. With reference to such a conception, one wants to go to the heavenly planets to enjoy with the young girls there and drink soma-rasa. Such imaginary pleasure, however, has no value. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.23), antavat tu phala\u1e41 te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 tad bhavaty alpa-medhas\u0101m: \u201cMen of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary.\u201d Even if by fruitive activity or worship of the demigods one is elevated to the higher planetary systems for sense enjoyment, his situation is condemned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as antavat, perishable. The happiness one enjoys in this way is like the pleasure of embracing a young woman in a dream; for some time it may be pleasing, but actually the basic principle is false. The mental concoctions of happiness and distress in this material world are compared to dreams because of their falseness. All thoughts of obtaining happiness by using the material senses have a false background and therefore have no meaning."

Another example is that sometimes a patient dies in spite of a good physician and good medicine. Thus without the protection of the Lord one cannot live, with or without parents. Another point in this verse is that fathers and mothers have protective feelings for their children even in bird and beast society, not to speak of human society. Kali-yuga, however, is so degraded that a father and mother even kill their children in the womb on the plea of their scientific knowledge that within the womb the child has no life. Prestigious medical practitioners give this opinion, and therefore the father and mother of this day kill their children within the womb. How degraded human society has become! Their scientific knowledge is so advanced that they think that within the egg and the embryo there is no life. Now these so-called scientists are receiving Nobel Prizes for advancing the theory of chemical evolution. But if chemical combinations are the source of life, why don\u2019t the scientists manufacture something like an egg through chemistry and put it in an incubator so that a chicken will come out? What is their answer? With their scientific knowledge they are unable to create even an egg. Such scientists are described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25, fools whose real knowledge has been taken away. They are not men of knowledge, but they pose as scientists and philosophers, although their so-called theoretical knowledge cannot produce practical results."

        "purport": " In this material world, the conception of self-preservation is the first law of nature. According to this conception, one should be interested in his personal safety and should then consider society, friendship, love, nationality, community and so on, which have all developed because of the bodily conception of life and a lack of knowledge of the spirit soul. This is called aj\u00f1\u0101na. As long as human society is in darkness and ignorance, men will continue to make huge arrangements in the bodily conception of life. This is described by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja as bharam. In the materialistic conception, modern civilization makes enormous arrangements for huge roads, houses, mills and factories, and this is man\u2019s conception of the advancement of civilization. People do not know, however, that at any time they themselves may be kicked out of the scene and forced to accept bodies that have nothing to do with these enormous houses, palaces, roads and automobiles. Therefore when Arjuna was thinking in terms of his bodily relationships with his kinsmen, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately chastised him, saying, kutas tv\u0101 ka\u015bmalam ida\u1e41 vi\u1e63ame samupasthitam an\u0101rya-ju\u1e63\u1e6dam: \u201cThis bodily conception of life is befitting the an\u0101ryas, the non-\u0100ryans, who are not advanced in knowledge.\u201d An \u0100ryan civilization is a civilization advanced in spiritual knowledge. Not merely by stamping oneself an \u0100ryan does one become an \u0100ryan. To keep oneself in the deepest darkness concerning spiritual knowledge and at the same time claim to be an \u0100ryan is a non-\u0100ryan position. In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya quotes as follows from the Brahma-vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47a: The purport is that as long as we are in this human form of body, our duty is to understand the soul within the body. The body is not the self; we are different from the body, and therefore there is no question of friends, enemies or responsibilities in terms of the bodily conception of life. One should not be very anxious about the body\u2019s changing from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to old age and then to apparent annihilation. Rather, one should be very seriously concerned about the soul within the body and how to release the soul from the material clutches. The living entity within the body is never annihilated; therefore one should surely know that whether one has many friends or many enemies, his friends cannot help him, and his enemies cannot do him any harm. One should know that he is a spirit soul (aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi) and that the constitutional position of the soul is unaffected by the changes of the body. In all circumstances, everyone, as a spirit soul, must be a devotee of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and should not be concerned with bodily relationships, whether with friends or with enemies. One should know that neither we ourselves nor our enemies in the bodily conception of life are ever killed."

She then forgot her grief over her son\u2019s death and thus engaged her mind and attention in understanding the real philosophy of life.",
        "purport": " When a relative dies one certainly becomes very much interested in philosophy, but when the funeral ceremony is over one again becomes attentive to materialism. Even Daityas, who are materialistic persons, sometimes think of philosophy when some relative meets death. The technical term for this attitude of the materialistic person is \u015bma\u015b\u0101na-vair\u0101gya, or detachment in a cemetery or place of cremation. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, four classes of men receive an understanding of spiritual life and God \u2014 \u0101rta (the distressed), jij\u00f1\u0101su (the inquisitive), arth\u0101rth\u012b (one who desires material gains) and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b (one who is searching for knowledge). Especially when one is very much distressed by material conditions, one becomes interested in God. Therefore Kunt\u012bdev\u012b said in her prayers to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that she preferred distress to a happy mood of life. In the material world, one who is happy forgets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God, but sometimes, if one is actually pious but in distress, he remembers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Queen Kunt\u012bdev\u012b therefore preferred distress because it is an opportunity for remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was leaving Kunt\u012bdev\u012b for His own country, Kunt\u012bdev\u012b regretfully said that she was better off in distress because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was always present, whereas now that the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were situated in their kingdom, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was going away. For a devotee, distress is an opportunity to remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly."
