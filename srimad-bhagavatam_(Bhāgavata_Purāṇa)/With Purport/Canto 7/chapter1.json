        "translation": "King Par\u012bk\u1e63it inquired: My dear br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, being everyone\u2019s well-wisher, is equal and extremely dear to everyone. How, then, did He become partial like a common man for the sake of Indra and thus kill Indra\u2019s enemies? How can a person equal to everyone be partial to some and inimical toward others?",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.29) the Lord says, samo\u00a0\u2019ha\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u na me dve\u1e63yo\u00a0\u2019sti na priya\u1e25: \u201cI am equal to everyone. No one is dear to Me, nor is anyone My enemy.\u201d In the previous canto, however, it has been observed that the Lord sided with Indra by killing the demons on his account (hata-putr\u0101 diti\u1e25 \u015bakra-p\u0101r\u1e63\u1e47i-gr\u0101he\u1e47a vi\u1e63\u1e47un\u0101). Therefore, the Lord was clearly partial to Indra, although He is the Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart. The soul is extremely dear to everyone, and similarly the Supersoul is also dear to everyone. Thus there cannot be any faulty action on the part of the Supersoul. The Lord is always kind to all living entities, irrespective of form and situation, yet He took the side of Indra just like an ordinary friend. This was the subject of Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s inquiry. As a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he knew very well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be partial to anyone, but when he saw that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a acted as the enemy of the demons, he was somewhat doubtful. Therefore he posed this question to \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b for a clear answer. A devotee cannot accept that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has material qualifications. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it knew perfectly well that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, being transcendental, has nothing to do with material qualities, but to confirm his conviction he wanted to hear from the authority \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says, samasya katha\u1e41 vai\u1e63amyam: since the Lord is equally disposed toward everyone, how can He be partial? Priyasya katham asure\u1e63u pr\u012bty-abh\u0101va\u1e25. The Lord, being the Supersoul, is extremely dear to everyone. Why, then, should the Lord display unsympathetic behavior toward the asuras? How is this impartial? Suh\u1e5bda\u015b ca katha\u1e41 te\u1e63v asauh\u0101rdam. Since the Lord says that He is suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m, the well-wisher of all living entities, how could He act with partiality by killing demons? These questions arose in the heart of Par\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and therefore he inquired from \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b."

        "translation": "Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the reservoir of all pleasure. Therefore, what benefit would He derive from siding with the demigods? What interest would He fulfill in this way? Since the Lord is transcendental, why should He fear the asuras, and how could He be envious of them?",
        "purport": " We should always remember the distinction between spiritual and material. That which is material is infected by material qualities, but these qualities cannot touch that which is spiritual, or transcendental. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute, whether He is in the material world or spiritual world. When we see partiality in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, this vision is due to His external energy. Otherwise how could His enemies attain salvation after being killed by Him? Everyone who deals with the Supreme Personality of Godhead gradually acquires the qualities of the Lord. The more one advances in spiritual consciousness, the less he is affected by the duality of material qualities. The Supreme Lord, therefore, must certainly be freed from these qualities. His enmity and friendship are external features presented by the material energy. He is always transcendental. He is absolute, whether He kills or bestows His favor. Envy and friendship arise in one who is imperfect. We fear our enemies because in the material world we are always in need of help. The Lord, however, does not need anyone\u2019s help, for He is \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101ma. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26): \u201cIf a devotee offers Me with devotion a little leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I shall accept it.\u201d Why does the Lord say this? Is He dependent on the offering of the devotee? He is not actually dependent, but He likes to be dependent upon His devotee. This is His mercy. Similarly, He does not fear the asuras. Thus there is no question of partiality in the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is always transcendental to material qualities, and therefore He is called nirgu\u1e47a, or without qualities. Because He is unborn, He does not have a material body to be subjected to attachment and hatred. Although the Lord is always above material existence, through His spiritual potency He appeared and acted like an ordinary human being, accepting duties and obligations, apparently like a conditioned soul.",
        "purport": " So-called attachment, detachment and obligations pertain to the material nature, which is an emanation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but whenever the Lord descends and acts in this material world, He does so in His spiritual position. Although His activities materially appear different, spiritually they are absolute and nondifferent. Thus it is an imposition upon the Supreme Lord to say that He is envious of anyone or friendly to anyone. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11) the Lord clearly says, avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam: \u201cFools deride Me when I descend in a human form.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears on this earth or within this universe without any change in His spiritual body or spiritual qualities. Indeed, He is never influenced by the material qualities. He is always free from such qualities, but He appears to act under material influence. This understanding is \u0101ropita, or an imposition. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, janma karma ca me divyam: whatever He does, being always transcendental, has nothing to do with material qualities; Eva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25: only devotees can understand the truth of how He acts. The fact is that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is never partial to anyone. He is always equal to everyone, but because of imperfect vision, influenced by material qualities, one imposes material qualities upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when one does so he becomes a m\u016b\u1e0dha, a fool. When one can properly understand the truth, one becomes devoted and nirgu\u1e47a, free from material qualities. Simply by understanding the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one can become transcendental, and as soon as one is transcendental he is fit to be transferred to the transcendental world. Tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti so\u00a0\u2019rjuna: one who understands the activities of the Lord in truth is transferred to the spiritual world after he gives up his material body."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is present in everyone\u2019s heart, fostering the reactions of sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not partial to anyone. The conditioned soul is under the influence of the various modes of material nature, and behind material nature is the Supreme Personality of Godhead; but one\u2019s victory and loss under the influence of sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a are reactions of these modes, not of the Supreme Lord\u2019s partiality. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, in the Bh\u0101gavata-sandarbha, has clearly said: According to this statement of the Bh\u0101gavata-sandarbha, the Supreme Lord, being always transcendental to the material qualities, is never affected by the influence of these qualities. This same characteristic is also present in the living being, but because he is conditioned by material nature, even the pleasure potency of the Lord is manifested in the conditioned soul as troublesome. In the material world the pleasure enjoyed by the conditioned soul is followed by many painful conditions. For instance, we have seen that in the two great wars, which were conducted by the rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a, both parties were actually ruined. The German people declared war against the English to ruin them, but the result was that both parties were ruined. Although the Allies were apparently victorious, at least on paper, actually neither of them were victorious. Therefore it should be concluded that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not partial to anyone. Everyone works under the influence of various modes of material nature, and when the various modes are prominent, the demigods or demons appear victorious under the influence of these modes. Everyone enjoys the fruits of his qualitative activities. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.11-13): \u201cThe manifestations of the modes of goodness can be experienced when all the gates of the body are illumined by knowledge. \u201cO chief of the Bh\u0101ratas, when there is an increase in the mode of passion, the symptoms of great attachment, uncontrollable desire, hankering, and intense endeavor develop. \u201cO son of Kuru, when there is an increase in the mode of ignorance, madness, illusion, inertia and darkness are manifested.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone\u2019s heart, simply gives the results of the increase in the various qualities, but He is impartial. He supervises victory and loss, but He does not take part in them. The various modes of material nature do not work all at once. The interactions of these modes are exactly like seasonal changes. Sometimes there is an increment of rajo-gu\u1e47a, sometimes of tamo-gu\u1e47a and sometimes sattva-gu\u1e47a. Generally the demigods are surcharged with sattva-gu\u1e47a, and therefore when the demons and the demigods fight, the demigods are victorious because of the prominence of their sattva-gu\u1e47a qualities. However, this is not the partiality of the Supreme Lord."

Just as one can understand the supply of fire in wood, the water in a waterpot, or the sky within a pot, one can understand whether a living entity is a demon or a demigod by understanding that living entity\u2019s devotional performances. A thoughtful man can understand how much a person is favored by the Supreme Lord by seeing his actions.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.41) the Lord says: \u201cKnow that all beautiful, glorious and mighty creations spring from but a spark of My splendor.\u201d We have the practical experience of seeing that one person is able to do very wonderful things whereas another cannot do those same things and cannot even do things that require only a little common sense. Therefore, how much a devotee has been favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be tested by the activities the devotee has performed. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10) the Lord also says: \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and who worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d This is very practical. A teacher instructs the student if the student is capable of taking more and more instructions. Otherwise, in spite of being instructed by the teacher, the student cannot make strides in his understanding. This has nothing to do with partiality. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says te\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 satata-yukt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 bhajat\u0101\u1e41 pr\u012bti-p\u016brvakam/ dad\u0101mi buddhi-yoga\u1e41 tam, this indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is prepared to give bhakti-yoga to everyone, but one must be capable of receiving it. That is the secret. Thus when a person exhibits wonderful devotional activities, a thoughtful man understands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has been more favorable to this devotee. This is not difficult to understand, but envious persons do not accept that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has bestowed His favor upon a particular devotee in accordance with his advanced position. Such foolish persons become envious and try to minimize an advanced devotee\u2019s activities. That is not Vai\u1e63\u1e47avism. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should appreciate the service rendered to the Lord by other Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Therefore a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as nirmatsara. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are never envious of other Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas or of anyone else, and therefore they are called nirmatsar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 sat\u0101m. As Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 informs us, one can understand how one is saturated with sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a or tamo-gu\u1e47a. In the examples given herewith, fire represents the mode of goodness. One can understand the constitution of a container for wood, petrol or other inflammable substances by the quantity of the fire. Similarly, water represents rajo-gu\u1e47a, the mode of passion. A small skin and the vast Atlantic Ocean both contain water, and by seeing the quantity of water in a container one can understand the size of the container. The sky represents the mode of ignorance. The sky is present in a small earthen pot and also in outer space. Thus by proper judgment one can see who is a devat\u0101, or demigod, and who is an asura, Yak\u1e63a or R\u0101k\u1e63asa according to the quantities of sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a. One cannot judge whether a person is a devat\u0101, an asura or a R\u0101k\u1e63asa by seeing him, but a sane man can understand this by the activities such a person performs. A general description is given in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a: vi\u1e63\u1e47u-bhakta\u1e25 sm\u1e5bto daiva \u0101suras tad-viparyaya\u1e25. A devotee of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is a demigod, whereas an asura or Yak\u1e63a is just the opposite. An asura is not a devotee of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; instead, for his sense gratification he is a devotee of the demigods, bh\u016btas, pretas and so on. Thus one can judge who is a devat\u0101, who is a R\u0101k\u1e63asa and who is an asura by how they conduct their activities. The word \u0101tm\u0101nam in this verse means param\u0101tm\u0101nam. The Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul, is situated in the core of everyone\u2019s heart (antata\u1e25). This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61). \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be\u00a0\u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati. The \u012b\u015bvara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being situated in everyone\u2019s heart, gives directions to everyone in terms of one\u2019s capabilities in taking the instructions. The instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 are open to everyone, but some people understand them properly, whereas others understand them so improperly that they cannot even believe in the existence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although reading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s book. Although the G\u012bt\u0101 says \u015br\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101ca, indicating that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke, they cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is due to their misfortune or incapability, which is caused by rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a, the modes of passion and ignorance. It is because of these modes that they cannot even understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas an advanced devotee like Arjuna understands Him and glorifies Him, saying, para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n: \u201cYou are the Supreme Brahman, the supreme abode and purifier.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is open to everyone, but one needs the capability to understand Him. By external features one cannot understand who is favored by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who is not. According to one\u2019s attitude, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes one\u2019s direct adviser, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes unknown. This is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s partiality; it is His response to one\u2019s ability to understand Him. According to one\u2019s receptiveness \u2014 whether one be a devat\u0101, asura, Yak\u1e63a or R\u0101k\u1e63asa \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s quality is proportionately exhibited. This proportionate exhibition of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s power is misunderstood by less intelligent men to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s partiality, but actually it is no such thing. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is equal to everyone, and according to one\u2019s ability to receive the favor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one advances in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura gives a practical example in this connection. In the sky there are many luminaries. At night, even in darkness, the moon is extremely brilliant and can be directly perceived. The sun is also extremely brilliant. When covered by clouds, however, these luminaries are not distinctly visible. Similarly, the more one advances in sattva-gu\u1e47a, the more his brilliance is exhibited by devotional service, but the more one is covered by rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a, the less visible his brilliance, for he is covered by these qualities. The visibility of one\u2019s qualities does not depend on the partiality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; it is due to various coverings in different proportions. Thus one can understand how far he has advanced in terms of sattva-gu\u1e47a and how much he is covered by rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a."

As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10): \u201cThis material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt\u012b, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.\u201d The different changes in the material world take place as actions and reactions of the three gu\u1e47as, but above the three gu\u1e47as is their director, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the various types of bodies given to the living entities by material nature (yantr\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101ni m\u0101yay\u0101), either sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a or tamo-gu\u1e47a is prominent.

In this way, in different types of bodies, the Lord (\u012b\u015bvara) gives directions as Param\u0101tm\u0101, and again, to destroy the body, He employs the tamo-gu\u1e47a.

Thus the Supreme Personality is never under the time factor nor under the material energy.",
        "purport": " One should not think that the Lord is dependent on the time factor. He actually creates the situation by which material nature acts and by which the conditioned soul is placed under material nature. Both the conditioned soul and the material nature act within the time factor, but the Lord is not subject to the actions and reactions of time, for time has been created by Him. To be more clear, \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that creation, maintenance and annihilation are all under the supreme will of the Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.7) the Lord says: \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself.\u201d Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the controller of everything, when He appears He is not within the limitations of material time (janma karma ca me divyam). In this verse the words k\u0101la\u1e41 caranta\u1e41 s\u1e5bjat\u012b\u015ba \u0101\u015brayam indicate that although the Lord acts within time, whether sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a or tamo-gu\u1e47a is prominent, one should not think that the Lord is under time\u2019s control. Time is within His control, for He creates time to act in a certain way; He is not working under the control of time. The creation of the material world is one of the Lord\u2019s pastimes. Everything is fully under His control. Since creation takes place when rajo-gu\u1e47a is prominent, the Lord creates the necessary time to give facilities for rajo-gu\u1e47a. Similarly, He also creates the necessary times for maintenance and annihilation. Thus this verse establishes that the Lord is not under the limitations of time. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller. Sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25: He possesses a blissful, spiritual body. An\u0101di\u1e25: He is not subordinate to anything. As the Lord confirms in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.7), matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat ki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1jaya: \u201cO conqueror of wealth [Arjuna], there is no truth superior to Me.\u201d Nothing can be above K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for He is the controller and creator of everything. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers say that this material world is mithy\u0101, false, and that one should therefore not bother about this mithy\u0101 creation (brahma satya\u1e41 jagan mithy\u0101). But this is not correct. Here it is said, satya-k\u1e5bt: whatever is created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, satya\u1e41 param, cannot be called mithy\u0101. The cause of the creation is satya, true, so how can the effect of the cause be mithy\u0101? The very word satya-k\u1e5bt is used to establish that everything created by the Lord is factual, never false. The creation may be temporary, but it is not false."

Then the demons, who are influenced by tamo-gu\u1e47a, are annihilated. The Supreme Lord induces the time factor to act in different ways, but He is never partial. Rather, His activities are glorious, and therefore He is called Uru\u015brav\u0101.",
        "purport": " The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.29), samo \u2019ha\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63u na me dve\u1e63yo\u00a0\u2019sti na priya\u1e25: \u201cI envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be partial; He is always equal to everyone. Therefore when the demigods are favored and the demons killed, this is not His partiality but the influence of the time factor. A good example in this regard is that an electrician connects both a heater and a cooler to the same electrical energy. The cause of the heating and cooling is the electrician\u2019s manipulation of the electrical energy according to his desire, but factually the electrician has nothing to do with causing heat or cold, nor with the enjoyment or suffering that results. There have been many historical incidents in which the Lord killed a demon, but the demon attained a higher position by the mercy of the Lord. P\u016btan\u0101 is an example. P\u016btan\u0101\u2019s purpose was to kill K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Aho bak\u012b ya\u1e41 stana-k\u0101la-k\u016b\u1e6dam. She approached the house of Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja with the purpose of killing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by smearing poison on her breast, yet when she was killed she attained the highest position, achieving the status of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mother. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind and impartial that because he sucked P\u016btan\u0101\u2019s breast, He immediately accepted her as His mother. This superfluous activity of killing P\u016btan\u0101 did not diminish the Lord\u2019s impartiality. He is suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m, the friend of everyone. Therefore partiality cannot apply to the character of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who always maintains His position as the supreme controller. The Lord killed P\u016btan\u0101 as an enemy, but because of His being the supreme controller, she attained an exalted position as His mother. \u015ar\u012bla Madhva Muni therefore remarks, k\u0101le k\u0101la-vi\u1e63aye\u00a0\u2019p\u012b\u015bit\u0101; deh\u0101di-k\u0101ra\u1e47atv\u0101t sur\u0101n\u012bkam iva sthita\u1e41 sattvam. Ordinarily a murderer is hanged, and in the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said that a king bestows mercy upon a murderer by killing him, thus saving him from various kinds of suffering. Because of his sinful activities, such a murderer is killed by the mercy of the king. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme judge, deals with matters in a similar way because He is the supreme controller. The conclusion, therefore, is that the Lord is always impartial and always very kind to all living entities."

This is impossible for Him. Thus He has no enemy and no friend. When He chastises the demons it is for their good, and when He accepts the prayers of the devotees it is for their good. He is affected neither by prayers nor by blasphemy.",
        "purport": " Because of being covered by material bodies, the conditioned souls, including even greatly learned scholars and falsely educated professors, all think that as soon as the body is finished, everything is finished. This is due to their bodily conception of life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no such bodily conception, nor is His body different from His self. Therefore, since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no material conception of life, how can He be affected by material prayers and accusations? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is described herewith as kaivalya, nondifferent from Himself. Since everyone has a material bodily conception of life, if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had such a conception what would be the difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the conditioned soul? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 are accepted as final because He does not possess a material body. As soon as one has a material body he has four deficiencies, but since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not possess a material body, He has no deficiencies. He is always spiritually conscious and blissful. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25: His form is eternal, blissful knowledge. Sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25, \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa and kaivalya are the same. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can expand Himself as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in the core of everyone\u2019s heart. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.3) this is confirmed. K\u1e63etraj\u00f1a\u1e41 c\u0101pi m\u0101\u1e41 viddhi sarva-k\u1e63etre\u1e63u bh\u0101rata: the Lord is the Param\u0101tm\u0101 \u2014 the \u0101tm\u0101 or Superself of all individual souls. Therefore it must naturally be concluded that He has no defective bodily conceptions. Although situated in everyone\u2019s body, He has no bodily conception of life. He is always free from such conceptions, and thus He cannot be affected by anything in relation to the material body of the j\u012bva. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.19): \u201cThose who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.\u201d Whenever the Lord punishes persons like demons, however, such punishment is meant for the good of the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul, being envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, may accuse Him, saying, \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is bad, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a thief\u201d and so on, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being kind to all living entities, does not consider such accusations. Instead, He takes account of the conditioned soul\u2019s chanting of \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u201d so many times. He sometimes punishes such demons for one life by putting them in a lower species, but then, when they have stopped accusing Him, they are liberated in the next life because of chanting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name constantly. Blaspheming the Supreme Lord or His devotee is not at all good for the conditioned soul, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being very kind, punishes the conditioned soul in one life for such sinful activities and then takes him back home, back to Godhead. The vivid example for this is V\u1e5btr\u0101sura, who was formerly Citraketu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, a great devotee. Because he derided Lord \u015aiva, the foremost of all devotees, he had to accept the body of a demon called V\u1e5btra, but then he was taken back to Godhead. Thus when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a punishes a demon or conditioned soul, He stops that soul\u2019s habit of blaspheming Him, and when the soul becomes completely pure, the Lord takes him back to Godhead."

        "translation": "Therefore by enmity or by devotional service, by fear, by affection or by lusty desire \u2014 by all of these or any one of them \u2014 if a conditioned soul somehow or other concentrates his mind upon the Lord, the result is the same, for the Lord, because of His blissful position, is never affected by enmity or friendship.",
        "purport": " From this verse one should not conclude that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is unaffected by favorable prayers or unfavorable blasphemy one should therefore blaspheme the Supreme Lord. This is not the regulative principle. Bhakti-yoga means \u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu\u015b\u012blanam: one should serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very favorably. This is the real injunction. Here it is said that although an enemy thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a unfavorably, the Lord is unaffected by such antidevotional service. Thus He offers His benedictions even to \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la and similarly inimical conditioned souls. This does not mean, however, that one should be inimical toward the Lord. The stress is given to the favorable execution of devotional service, not purposeful blasphemy of the Lord. It is said: One who hears blasphemy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotees should immediately take action or should leave. Otherwise he will be put into hellish life perpetually. There are many such injunctions. Therefore as a regulative principle one should not be unfavorable toward the Lord but always favorably inclined toward Him. \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la\u2019s achievement of oneness with the Supreme Lord was different because Jaya and Vijaya, from the very beginning of their material existence, were ordained to treat the Supreme Lord as an enemy for three lives and then return home, back to Godhead. Jaya and Vijaya inwardly knew that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but they purposely became His enemies to be delivered from material life. From the very beginning of their lives they thought of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an enemy, and even though blaspheming Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they chanted the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constantly along with their inimical thoughts. Thus they were purified because of chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is to be understood that even a blasphemer can be freed from sinful activities by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Certainly, therefore, freedom is assured for a devotee who is always favorable to the service of the Lord. This will be clear from the following verse. By rapt attention fixed upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is purified, and thus one is delivered from material life. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has very nicely explained the word bhayena, which means \u201cby fear.\u201d When the gop\u012bs went to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the dead of night, they certainly feared chastisement by their relatives \u2014 their husbands, brothers and fathers \u2014 but nonetheless, not caring for their relatives, they went to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There was certainly fear, but this fear could not check their devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should not mistakenly think that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must be worshiped by an inimical attitude like that of \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la. The injunction is \u0101nuk\u016blyasya graha\u1e47a\u1e41 pr\u0101tik\u016blyasya varjanam: one should give up unfavorable activities and accept only favorable conditions in devotional service. Generally, if one blasphemes the Supreme Personality of Godhead he is punished. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.19): There are many such injunctions. One should not try to worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a unfavorably; otherwise he must be punished, at least for one life, to be purified. As one should not try to be killed by embracing an enemy, a tiger or a snake, one should not blaspheme the Supreme Personality of Godhead and become His enemy in order to be put into hellish life. The purpose of this verse is to emphasize that even the enemy of the Lord can be delivered, not to speak of His friend. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya also says in many ways that one should not blaspheme Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u through one\u2019s mind, words or actions, for a blasphemer will go to hellish life along with his forefathers. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.19-20) the Lord says: \u201cThose who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life. Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.\u201d One who blasphemes the Lord is put into a family of asuras, in which there is every chance of forgetting the service of the Lord. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a further states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11-12): M\u016b\u1e0dhas, rascals, blaspheme the Supreme Lord because He appears exactly like a human being. They do not know the unlimited opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done by those who have taken the attitude of enemies will be baffled (mogh\u0101\u015b\u0101\u1e25). If these enemies try to be liberated or to merge into the existence of Brahman, if they desire to be elevated to the higher planetary systems as karm\u012bs, or even if they desire to return home, back to Godhead, they will certainly be baffled. As for Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, although he was extremely inimical toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he always thought of his son, who was a great devotee. Therefore by the grace of his son, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was also delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conclusion is that one should not give up pure devotional service. For one\u2019s own benefit, one should not imitate Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu or \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la. This is not the way to achieve success."

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012bm\u0101n N\u0101rada Muni, the topmost pure devotee, praises K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s enemies like \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la because their minds are always completely absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Indeed, he thinks himself deficient in the inspiration of being feelingly absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This does not mean, however, that the enemies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are more elevated than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pure devotees. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 5.205) K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja Gosv\u0101m\u012b also thinks of himself in such a humble way: \u201cI am a worse sinner than Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i and am even lower than the worms in the stool.\u201d A pure devotee always thinks himself more deficient than everyone else. If a devotee approaches \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b to offer some service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b thinks that the devotee is greater than She. Thus N\u0101rada Muni says that according to his opinion the enemies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are better situated because they are fully absorbed in thoughts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in terms of killing Him, just as a very lusty man always thinks of women and their association. The essential point in this connection is that one should be fully absorbed in thoughts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, twenty-four hours a day. There are many devotees in r\u0101ga-m\u0101rga, which is exhibited in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Whether in d\u0101sya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, v\u0101tsalya-rasa or m\u0101dhurya-rasa, all the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are always overwhelmed by thoughts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is away from V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana tending the cows in the forest, the gop\u012bs, in the m\u0101dhurya-rasa, are always absorbed in thoughts of how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a walks in the forest. The soles of His feet are so soft that the gop\u012bs would not dare keep His lotus feet on their soft breasts. Indeed, they consider their breasts a very hard place for the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, yet those lotus feet wander in the forest, which is full of thorny plants. The gop\u012bs are absorbed in such thoughts at home, although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is away from them. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a plays with His young friends, mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 is very much disturbed by thoughts that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because of always playing and not taking His food properly, must be getting weak. These are examples of the exalted ecstasy felt in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service as manifested in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. This service is indirectly praised by N\u0101rada Muni in this verse. Especially for the conditioned soul, N\u0101rada Muni recommends that one somehow or other be absorbed in thoughts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for that will save one from all the dangers of material existence. Full absorption in thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the highest platform of bhakti-yoga."

Similarly, if the conditioned souls somehow or other think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, they will become free from their sins. Whether thinking of Him as their worshipable Lord or an enemy, because of constantly thinking of Him they will regain their spiritual bodies.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.10) the Lord says: \u201cBeing freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me \u2014 and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me.\u201d There are two ways of constantly thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 as a devotee and as an enemy. A devotee, of course, by his knowledge and tapasya, becomes free from fear and anger and becomes a pure devotee. Similarly, an enemy, although thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a inimically, thinks of Him constantly and also becomes purified. This is confirmed elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.30), where the Lord says: \u201cEven if one commits the most abominable actions, if he engages in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.\u201d A devotee undoubtedly worships the Lord with rapt attention. Similarly, if an enemy (sudur\u0101c\u0101ra\u1e25) always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he also becomes a purified devotee. The example given here concerns the grassworm that becomes beelike because of constantly thinking of the bee that forces it to enter a hole. By always thinking of the bee in fear, the grassworm starts to become a bee. This is a practical example. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears within this material world for two purposes \u2014 paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m: to protect the devotees and annihilate the demons. The s\u0101dhus and devotees certainly think of the Lord always, but du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012bs, the demons like Ka\u1e41sa and \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la, also think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in terms of killing Him. By thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, both the demons and devotees attain liberation from the clutches of material m\u0101y\u0101. This verse uses the word m\u0101y\u0101-manuje. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in His original spiritual potency (sambhav\u0101my \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101), He is not forced to accept a form made by material nature. Therefore the Lord is addressed as \u012b\u015bvara, the controller of m\u0101y\u0101. He is not controlled by m\u0101y\u0101. When a demon continuously thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because of enmity toward Him, he is certainly freed from the sinful reactions of his life. To think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in any way, in terms of His name, form, qualities, paraphernalia or anything pertaining to Him, is beneficial for everyone. S\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana\u1e25. Thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, hearing the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or hearing the pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will make one pure, and then he will become a devotee. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore trying to introduce the system of somehow or other letting everyone hear the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and take K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pras\u0101da. Thus one will gradually become a devotee, and his life will be successful."

This great attention may be due to lusty desires, inimical feelings, fear, affection or devotional service. I shall now explain how one receives K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy simply by concentrating one\u2019s mind upon Him.",
        "purport": " As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.33.39): If a bona fide listener hears of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes with the gop\u012bs, which seem to be lusty affairs, the lusty desires in his heart, which constitute the heart disease of the conditioned soul, will be vanquished, and he will become a most exalted devotee of the Lord. If one who hears of the gop\u012bs\u2019 lusty behavior with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes free from lusty desires, certainly the gop\u012bs who approached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a became free from all such desires. Similarly, \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la and others who were very much envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who constantly thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a became free from envy. Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 were fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because of affection. When the mind is somehow or other fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the material part is very soon vanquished, and the spiritual part \u2014 attraction to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2014 becomes manifest. This indirectly confirms that if one thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enviously, simply because of thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he becomes free from all sinful reactions and thus becomes a pure devotee.

Thus it is described here that the gop\u012bs, by their lusty desires, which were based upon their intense love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, became the most beloved devotees of the Lord. Although the gop\u012bs at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana expressed their lusty desires in relationship with a paramour (parak\u012bya-rasa), they actually had no lusty desires. This is significant of spiritual advancement. Their desires appeared lusty, but actually they were not the lusty desires of the material world. Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta compares the desires of the spiritual and material world to gold and iron. Both gold and iron are metal, but there is a vast difference in their value. The lusty desires of the gop\u012bs for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are compared to gold, and material lusty desires are compared to iron. Ka\u1e41sa and other enemies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a merged into the existence of Brahman, but why should K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s friends and devotees have the same position? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees attain the association of the Lord as His constant companions, either in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Similarly, although N\u0101rada Muni wanders in the three worlds, he has exalted devotion for N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (ai\u015bvaryam\u0101n). The V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47is and Yadus and the father and mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana all have familial relationships with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s foster father and mother in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, however, are more exalted than Vasudeva and Devak\u012b."

Therefore, kindly explain how associates of the Personality of Godhead were cursed to descend in material bodies like ordinary persons.",
        "purport": " This very significant question would be difficult for an ordinary person to answer, but N\u0101rada Muni, being an authority, could answer it. Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira inquired from him, saying, etad \u0101khy\u0101tum arhasi: \u201cOnly you can explain the reason.\u201d From authoritative sources it can be discerned that associates of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u who descend from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha do not actually fall. They come with the purpose of fulfilling the desire of the Lord, and their descent to this material world is comparable to that of the Lord. The Lord comes to this material world through the agency of His internal potency, and similarly, when a devotee or associate of the Lord descends to this material world, he does so through the action of the spiritual energy. Any pastime conducted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is an arrangement by yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, not mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101. Therefore it is to be understood that when Jaya and Vijaya descended to this material world, they came because there was something to be done for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Otherwise it is a fact that no one falls from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Of course, a living entity who desires s\u0101yujya-mukti remains in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s Brahman effulgence, which is dependent on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body (brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham). Such an impersonalist who takes shelter of the Brahman effulgence must surely fall down. This is stated in the \u015b\u0101stra (Bh\u0101g. 10.2.32): \u201cO Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure. Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet.\u201d The impersonalists cannot reach the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets to become associates of the Lord, and therefore, according to their desires, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives them s\u0101yujya-mukti. However, since s\u0101yujya-mukti is partial mukti, they must fall again to this material world. When it is said that the individual soul falls from Brahmaloka, this applies to the impersonalist. From authoritative sources it is learned that Jaya and Vijaya were sent to this material world to fulfill the Lord\u2019s desire to fight. The Lord also sometimes wants to fight, but who can fight with the Lord but a very confidential devotee of the Lord? Jaya and Vijaya descended to this world to fulfill the Lord\u2019s desire. Therefore in each of their three births \u2014 first as Hira\u1e47y\u0101k\u1e63a and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, second as R\u0101va\u1e47a and Kumbhakar\u1e47a, and third as \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la and Dantavakra \u2014 the Lord personally killed them. In other words, these associates of the Lord, Jaya and Vijaya, descended to the material world to serve the Lord by fulfilling His desire to fight. Otherwise, as Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira says, a\u015braddheya iv\u0101bh\u0101ti: the statement that a servant of the Lord could fall from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha seems unbelievable. How Jaya and Vijaya came to this material world is explained by N\u0101rada Muni as follows."
