In other words, such impediments on the spiritual path could not stop him from progressing, for he was directly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are physically and mentally contaminated by atheism cannot be situated on the transcendental platform, but as soon as one is freed from material contamination he is immediately fit to be situated in devotional service."

Such a devotee is better than such a br\u0101hma\u1e47a because the devotee can purify his whole family, whereas the so-called br\u0101hma\u1e47a in a position of false prestige cannot purify even himself.",
        "purport": " Here is a statement by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, one of the twelve authorities, regarding the distinction between a devotee and a br\u0101hma\u1e47a expert in karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, or Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. There are four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas, which divide human society, but the central principle is to become a first-class pure devotee. It is said in the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya: \u201cIf one is born in a high family like that of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya or vai\u015bya but is not a devotee of the Lord, all his good qualifications as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya or vai\u015bya are null and void. Indeed, they are considered decorations of a dead body.\u201d In this verse Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja speaks of the vipras, the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a is considered best among the divisions of br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra, but a devotee born in a low ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la family is better than such br\u0101hma\u1e47as, not to speak of the k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and others. A devotee is better than anyone, for he is in the transcendental position on the Brahman platform. \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d (Bg. 14.26) The twelve qualities of a first-class br\u0101hma\u1e47a, as stated in the book called Sanat-suj\u0101ta, are as follows: The European and American devotees in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement are sometimes accepted as br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but the so-called caste br\u0101hma\u1e47as are very much envious of them. In answer to such envy, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja says that one who has been born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family but is falsely proud of his prestigious position cannot even purify himself, not to speak of his family, whereas if a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la, a lowborn person, is a devotee and has fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord, he can purify his entire family. We have had actual experience of how Americans and Europeans, because of their full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, have purified their whole families, so much so that a mother of a devotee, at the time of her death, inquired about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with her last breath. Therefore it is theoretically true and has been practically proven that a devotee can give the best service to his family, his community, his society and his nation. The foolish accuse a devotee of following the principle of escapism, but actually the fact is that a devotee is the right person to elevate his family. A devotee engages everything in the service of the Lord, and therefore he is always exalted."

        "purport": " In bhakti-yoga it is recommended that a devotee follow nine principles: \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam/ arcana\u1e41 vandana\u1e41 d\u0101sya\u1e41 sakhyam \u0101tma-nivedanam. This service of glorifying the Lord by hearing, chanting and so on is not, of course, meant for the benefit of the Lord; this devotional service is recommended for the benefit of the devotee. The Lord is always glorious, whether the devotee glorifies Him or not, but if the devotee engages in glorifying the Lord, the devotee himself automatically becomes glorious. Ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjana\u1e41 bhava-mah\u0101-d\u0101v\u0101gni-nirv\u0101pa\u1e47am. By glorifying the Lord constantly, the living entity becomes purified in the core of his heart, and thus he can understand that he does not belong to the material world but is a spirit soul whose actual activity is to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that he may become free from the material clutches. Thus the blazing fire of material existence is immediately extinguished (bhava-mah\u0101-d\u0101v\u0101gni-nirv\u0101pa\u1e47am). A foolish person is amazed that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a orders, sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: \u201cAbandon all varieties of religious activities and just surrender unto Me.\u201d Some foolish scholars even say that this is too much to demand. But this demand is not for the benefit of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; rather, it is for the benefit of human society. If human beings individually and collectively surrender everything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all of human society will benefit. One who does not dedicate everything to the Supreme Lord is described in this verse as avidu\u1e63a, a rascal. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.15), the Lord Himself speaks in the same way: \u201cThose miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.\u201d Because of ignorance and misfortune, the atheists and the nar\u0101dhamas, the lowest of men, do not surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore although the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is full in Himself, He appears in different yugas to demand the surrender of the conditioned souls so that they will benefit by becoming free from the material clutches. In conclusion, the more we engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and render service unto the Lord, the more we benefit. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not need service from any of us."

The lion is very fearsome for other animals, but its cubs are not at all afraid of the lion. The water of the sea is certainly dreadful for all living entities on the land, but within the sea even the small fish is unafraid. Why? Because the small fish has taken shelter of the big ocean.

        "purport": " Being in the material world is certainly miserable, but certainly when one is put into the association of asuras, or atheistic men, it is intolerably so. One may ask why the living entity is put into the material world. Indeed, sometimes foolish people deride the Lord for having put them here. Actually, everyone is put into conditional life according to his karma. Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, representing all the other conditioned souls, admits that he was put into life among the asuras because of the results of his karma. The Lord is known as k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a-vatsala because He is extremely kind to the conditioned souls. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, therefore, the Lord appears whenever there are discrepancies in the execution of religious principles (yad\u0101 yad\u0101 hi dharmasya gl\u0101nir bhavati bh\u0101rata \u2026 tad\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 s\u1e5bj\u0101my aham).

Thus Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja expected that the Lord, by His kindness, would call him again to the shelter of His lotus feet. In other words, everyone should be eager to return home, back to Godhead, taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and thus being fully trained in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Although there are many remedies by which to get out of miserable life, any such remedies in the material world are more miserable than the miseries themselves. Therefore I think that the only remedy is to engage in Your service. Kindly instruct me in such service.",
        "purport": " Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja aspired to engage in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. After the death of his father, who was materially very opulent, Prahl\u0101da would have inherited his father\u2019s property, which extended throughout the world, but Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was not inclined to accept such material opulence, for whether one is in the heavenly or hellish planets or is a rich or a poor man\u2019s son, material conditions are everywhere. Therefore no condition of life is at all pleasing. If one wants the uncontaminated pleasure of blissful life, he must engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Material opulence may be somewhat pleasing for the time being, but to come to that temporary pleasing condition one must work extremely hard. When a poor man is rich he may be better situated, but to come to that position he had to accept many miseries. The fact is that in material life, whether one is miserable or happy, both conditions are miserable. If one actually wants happy, blissful life, one must become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and constantly engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. That is the real remedy. The entire world is under the illusion that people will be happy by advancing in materialistic measures to counteract the miseries of conditional life, but this attempt will never be successful. Humanity must be trained to engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. That is the purpose of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. There can be no happiness in changing one\u2019s material conditions, for everywhere there is trouble and misery."

I shall chant Your glories, following exactly in the footsteps of Lord Brahm\u0101 and his disciplic succession. In this way I shall undoubtedly be able to cross the ocean of nescience.",
        "purport": " A devotee\u2019s life and duty are very well explained herein. As soon as a devotee can chant the holy name and glories of the Supreme Lord, he certainly comes to the liberated position. Attachment for glorifying the Lord by hearing and chanting the holy name and activities of the Lord (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25) certainly brings one to the position where material contamination is absent. One should chant the bona fide songs received from the disciplic succession. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said that the chanting is powerful when one follows the disciplic succession (eva\u1e41 parampar\u0101-pr\u0101ptam ima\u1e41 r\u0101jar\u1e63ayo vidu\u1e25). Manufacturing many ways of chanting will never be effective. However, chanting the song or the narration left by the previous \u0101c\u0101ryas (mah\u0101jano yena gata\u1e25 sa panth\u0101\u1e25) is extremely effective, and this process is very easy. Therefore in this verse Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja uses the word a\u00f1ja\u1e25 (\u201ceasily\u201d). Accepting the thoughts of exalted authorities through disciplic succession is certainly much easier than the method of mental speculation, by which one tries to invent some means to understand the Absolute Truth. The best process is to accept the instructions of the previous \u0101c\u0101ryas and follow them. Then God realization and self-realization become extremely easy. By following this easy method, one is liberated from the contamination of the material modes of nature, and thus one can certainly cross the ocean of nescience, in which there are many miserable conditions. By following in the footsteps of the great \u0101c\u0101ryas, one associates with the ha\u1e41sas or paramaha\u1e41sas, those who are completely freed from material contamination. Indeed, by following the instructions of the \u0101c\u0101ryas one is always freed from all material contamination, and thus one\u2019s life becomes successful, for one reaches the goal of life. This material world is miserable, regardless of one\u2019s standard of life. Of this there is no doubt. Attempts to mitigate the miseries of material existence by material methods will never be successful. One must take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to become really happy; otherwise happiness is impossible. One might say that becoming advanced in spiritual life also involves tapasya, voluntary acceptance of some inconvenience. However, such inconvenience is not as dangerous as material attempts to mitigate all miseries."

        "translation": "My Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, O Supreme, because of a bodily conception of life, embodied souls neglected and not cared for by You cannot do anything for their betterment. Whatever remedies they accept, although perhaps temporarily beneficial, are certainly impermanent. For example, a father and mother cannot protect their child, a physician and medicine cannot relieve a suffering patient, and a boat on the ocean cannot protect a drowning man.",
        "purport": " Through parental care, through remedies for different kinds of disease, and through means of protection on the water, in the air and on land, there is always an endeavor for relief from various kinds of suffering in the material world, but none of them are guaranteed measures for protection. They may be beneficial temporarily, but they afford no permanent benefit. Despite the presence of a father and mother, a child cannot be protected from accidental death, disease and various other miseries. No one can help, including the parents. Ultimately the shelter is the Lord, and one who takes shelter of the Lord is protected. This is guaranteed. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.31), kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati: \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.\u201d Therefore, unless one is protected by the mercy of the Lord, no remedial measure can act effectively. One should consequently depend fully on the causeless mercy of the Lord. Although as a matter of routine duty one must of course accept other remedial measures, no one can protect one who is neglected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this material world, everyone is trying to counteract the onslaught of material nature, but everyone is ultimately fully controlled by material nature. Therefore even though so-called philosophers and scientists try to surmount the onslaught of material nature, they have not been able to do so. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.9) that the real sufferings of the material world are four \u2014 janma-m\u1e5btyu-jar\u0101-vy\u0101dhi (birth, death, old age and disease). In the history of the world, no one has been successful in conquering these miseries imposed by material nature. Prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 karm\u0101\u1e47i sarva\u015ba\u1e25. Nature (prak\u1e5bti) is so strong that no one can overcome her stringent laws. So-called scientists, philosophers, religionists and politicians should therefore conclude that they cannot offer facilities to the people in general. They should make vigorous propaganda to awaken the populace and raise them to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Our humble attempt to propagate the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement all over the world is the only remedy that can bring about a peaceful and happy life. We can never be happy without the mercy of the Supreme Lord (tvad-upek\u1e63it\u0101n\u0101m). If we keep displeasing our supreme father, we shall never be happy within this material world, in either the upper or lower planetary systems."

        "purport": " Whether one thinks himself protected by his parents, by the government, by some place or by some other cause, everything is due to the various potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everything that is done, whether in the higher, middle or lower planetary systems, is due to the supervision or control of the Supreme Lord. It is therefore said, karma\u1e47\u0101 daiva-netre\u1e47a jantur dehopapattaye. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul within the core of everyone\u2019s heart, gives inspirations for action according to one\u2019s mentality. All of these mentalities are merely facilities given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to the person acting. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 therefore says, matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca: everyone works according to the inspiration given by the Supersoul. Because everyone has a different goal of life, everyone acts differently, as guided by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words yasmin yato yarhi yena ca yasya yasm\u0101t indicate that all activities, whatever they may be, are but different features of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All of them are created by the living entity and fulfilled by the mercy of the Lord.

As long as we work according to our material senses we are in material life, but as soon as we act according to the real, transcendental direction of the Lord, our position is spiritual. The activities of bhakti, devotional service, are directly under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra states: When one gives up materially designated positions and works directly under the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one\u2019s spiritual life is revived. This is described as svar\u016bpena avasthiti, being situated in one\u2019s original constitutional position. This is the real description of mukti, or liberation from material bondage."

        "translation": "O Lord, O supreme eternal, by expanding Your plenary portion You have created the subtle bodies of the living entities through the agency of Your external energy, which is agitated by time. Thus the mind entraps the living entity in unlimited varieties of desires to be fulfilled by the Vedic directions of karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da [fruitive activity] and the sixteen elements. Who can get free from this entanglement unless he takes shelter at Your lotus feet?",
        "purport": " If the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present in everything, where is the question of being liberated from material encagement to spiritual, blissful life? Indeed, it is a fact that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of everything, as we understand from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhava\u1e25). All the activities in both the spiritual and material world are certainly conducted by the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the agency of either the material or spiritual nature. As further confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10), may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sacar\u0101caram: without the direction of the Supreme Lord, material nature cannot do anything; it cannot act independently. Therefore, in the beginning the living entity wanted to enjoy the material energy, and to give the living entity all facility, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, created this material world and gave the living entity the facility to concoct different ideas and plans through the mind. These facilities offered by the Lord to the living entity constitute the sixteen kinds of perverted support in terms of the knowledge-gathering senses, the working senses, the mind and the five material elements. The wheel of repeated birth and death is created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but to direct the bewildered living entity in progress toward liberation according to varied stages of advancement, different directions are given in the Vedas (chandomayam). If one wants to be elevated to the higher planetary systems, he may follow the Vedic directions. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25): \u201cThose who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with Me.\u201d The real purpose of the Vedas is to direct one back home, back to Godhead, but the living entity, not knowing the real goal of his life, wants to go sometimes here and sometimes there and do sometimes this and sometimes that. In this way he wanders throughout the entire universe, imprisoned in various species and thus engaging in various activities for which he must suffer the reactions. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore says: The fallen, conditioned living entity, trapped by the external energy, loiters in the material world, but if by good fortune he meets a bona fide representative of the Lord who gives him the seed of devotional service, and if he takes advantage of such a guru, or representative of God, he receives the bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja, the seed of devotional service. If he properly cultivates K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is then gradually elevated to the spiritual world. The ultimate conclusion is that one must surrender to the principles of bhakti-yoga, for then one will gradually attain liberation. No other method of liberation from the material struggle is at all possible."

In other words, these material qualities are under Your full control, and You are never conquered by them. Therefore the time element is Your representation. My Lord, O Supreme, no one can conquer You. As for me, however, I am being crushed by the wheel of time, and therefore I surrender fully unto You. Now kindly take me under the protection of Your lotus feet.",
        "purport": " The wheel of material miseries is also a creation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He is not under the control of the material energy. Rather, He is the controller of the material energy, whereas we, the living entities, are under its control. When we give up our constitutional position (j\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa\u2019), the Supreme Personality of Godhead creates this material energy and her influence over the conditioned soul. Therefore He is the Supreme, and only He can deliver the conditioned soul from the onslaught of material nature (m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te). M\u0101y\u0101, the external energy, continuously imposes upon the conditioned souls the suffering of the threefold miseries of this material world. Therefore, in the previous verse, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja prayed to the Lord, \u201cBut for Your Lordship, no one can save me.\u201d Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja has also explained that a child\u2019s protectors, his parents, cannot save the child from the onslaught of birth and death, nor can medicine and a physician save one from death, nor can a boat or similar means of protection save a person drowning in the water, for everything is controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore suffering humanity must surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself demands in the last instruction of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\u201d All of human society must take advantage of this offer and thus be saved by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the danger of being crushed by the wheel of time, the wheel of past, present and future. The word ni\u1e63p\u012b\u1e0dyam\u0101nam (\u201cbeing crushed\u201d) is very significant. Every living entity in the material condition is actually being crushed again and again, and to be saved from this position one must take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then one will be happy. The word prapannam is also very significant, for unless one fully surrenders to the Supreme Lord one cannot be saved from being crushed. A criminal is put in prison and punished by the government, but the same government, if it likes, can release the criminal from imprisoned life. Similarly, we must know conclusively that our material condition of suffering has been allotted to us by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and if we want to be saved from this suffering, we must appeal to the same controller. Thus one can be saved from this material condition."

As powerful time, You destroy them all. Therefore, because of my experience, I do not wish to possess them. My dear Lord, I request You to place me in touch with Your pure devotee and let me serve him as a sincere servant.",
        "purport": " By studying \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, every intelligent man can get experience like that of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja through the historical incidents mentioned in this great literature of spiritual knowledge. By following in the footsteps of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, one should gain thorough experience that all material opulence is perishable at every moment. Even this body, for which we try to acquire so many sensual pleasures, may perish at any time. The soul, however, is eternal. Na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre: the soul is never vanquished, even when the body is destroyed. An intelligent man, therefore, should care for the happiness of the spirit soul, not of the body. Even if one receives a body with a long duration of life, like those of Lord Brahm\u0101 and the other great demigods, it will also be destroyed, and therefore an intelligent man should be concerned with the imperishable spirit soul. To save oneself, one must take shelter of a pure devotee. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore says, ch\u0101\u1e0diy\u0101 vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-sev\u0101 nist\u0101ra p\u0101yeche keb\u0101. If one wants to save himself from material nature\u2019s onslaughts, which arise because of the material body, one must become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and try to fully understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9), janma karma ca me divyam eva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25. One should understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in truth, and this one can do only by serving a pure devotee. Thus Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja prays that Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva place him in touch with a pure devotee and servant instead of awarding him material opulence. Every intelligent man within this material world must follow Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Mah\u0101jano yena gata\u1e25 sa panth\u0101\u1e25. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not want to enjoy the estate left by his father; rather, he wanted to become a servant of the servant of the Lord. The illusory human civilization that perpetually endeavors for happiness through material advancement is rejected by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and those who strictly follow in his footsteps. There are different types of material opulence, known technically as bhukti, mukti and siddhi. Bhukti refers to being situated in a very good position, like a position with the demigods in the higher planetary systems, where one can enjoy material sense gratification to the greatest extent. Mukti refers to being disgusted with material advancement and thus desiring to become one with the Supreme. Siddhi refers to executing a severe type of meditation, like that of the yog\u012bs, to attain eight kinds of perfection (a\u1e47im\u0101, laghim\u0101, mahim\u0101, etc.). All who desire some material advancement through bhukti, mukti or siddhi are punishable in due course of time, and they return to material activities. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja rejected them all; he simply wanted to engage as an apprentice under the guidance of a pure devotee."

Happiness is very difficult to obtain, but because they are unable to control their senses, they run after the so-called happiness of the material world and never come to the right conclusion.",
        "purport": " There is a song in the Bengali language which states, \u201cI constructed this home for happiness, but unfortunately there was a fire, and everything has now been burnt to ashes.\u201d This illustrates the nature of material happiness. Everyone knows it, but nonetheless one plans to hear or think something very pleasing. Unfortunately, all of one\u2019s plans are annihilated in due course of time. There were many politicians who planned empires, supremacy and control of the world, but in due time all their plans and empires \u2014 and even the politicians themselves \u2014 were vanquished. Everyone should take lessons from Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja about how we are engaged in so-called temporary happiness through bodily exercises for sense enjoyment. All of us repeatedly make plans, which are all repeatedly frustrated. Therefore one should stop such planmaking. As one cannot stop a blazing fire by constantly pouring ghee upon it, one cannot satisfy oneself by increasing plans for sense enjoyment. The blazing fire is bhava-mah\u0101-d\u0101v\u0101gni, the forest fire of material existence. This forest fire occurs automatically, without endeavor. We want to be happy in the material world, but this will never be possible; we shall simply increase the blazing fire of desires. Our desires cannot be satisfied by illusory thoughts and plans; rather, we have to follow the instructions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja.

        "translation": "O my Lord, O Supreme, because I was born in a family full of the hellish material qualities of passion and ignorance, what is my position? And what is to be said of Your causeless mercy, which was never offered even to Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva or the goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012b? You never put Your lotus hand upon their heads, but You have put it upon mine.",
        "purport": " Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was surprised at the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, for although Prahl\u0101da was born in a demoniac family and although the Lord had never before placed His lotus hand on the head of Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, or the goddess of fortune, His constant companion, Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva kindly placed His hand on the head of Prahl\u0101da. This is the meaning of causeless mercy. The causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead may be bestowed upon anyone, regardless of his position in this material world. Everyone is eligible to worship the Supreme Lord, irrespective of his material position. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d Anyone who engages in continuous devotional service to the Lord is situated in the spiritual world and has nothing to do with the material qualities (sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a). Because Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was situated on the spiritual platform, he had nothing to do with his body, which had been born of the modes of passion and ignorance. The symptoms of passion and ignorance are described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.19) as lust and hankering (tad\u0101 rajas tamo-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25 k\u0101ma-lobh\u0101daya\u015b ca ye). Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, being a great devotee, thought the body born of his father to be born of passion and ignorance, but because Prahl\u0101da was fully engaged in the service of the Lord, his body did not belong to the material world. The pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u2019s body is spiritualized even in this life. For example, when iron is put into a fire it becomes red-hot and is no longer iron but fire. Similarly, the so-called material bodies of devotees who fully engage in the devotional service of the Lord, being constantly in the fire of spiritual life, have nothing to do with matter, but are spiritualized. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya remarks that the goddess of fortune, the mother of the universe, could not get mercy similar to that which was offered to Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, for although the goddess of fortune is always a constant companion of the Supreme Lord, the Lord is more inclined to His devotees. In other words, devotional service is so great that when it is offered even by those born in low families, the Lord accepts it as being more valuable than the service offered by the goddess of fortune. Lord Brahm\u0101, King Indra and the other demigods living in the upper planetary systems are situated in a different spirit of consciousness, and therefore they are sometimes troubled by demons, but a devotee, even if situated in the lower planets, enjoys life in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under any circumstances. Parata\u1e25 svata\u1e25 karmata\u1e25: as he acts himself, as he is instructed by others or as he performs his material activities, he enjoys life in every respect. In this regard, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya quotes the following verses, which are mentioned in the Brahma-tarka:"

        "translation": "Unlike an ordinary living entity, my Lord, You do not discriminate between friends and enemies, the favorable and the unfavorable, because for You there is no conception of higher and lower. Nonetheless, You offer Your benedictions according to the level of one\u2019s service, exactly as a desire tree delivers fruits according to one\u2019s desires and makes no distinction between the lower and the higher.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.11) the Lord clearly says, ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham: \u201cAs one surrenders to Me, I reward him accordingly.\u201d As stated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, j\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa\u2019: every living being is an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to the service the living entity renders, he automatically receives benedictions from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who does not make distinctions, thinking, \u201cHere is a person in an intimate relationship with Me, and here is a person I dislike.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a advises everyone to surrender to Him (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). One\u2019s relationship with the Supreme Lord is in proportion to that surrender and the service one renders unto the Lord. Thus throughout the entire world the higher or lower positions of the living entities are selected by the living entities themselves. If one is inclined to dictate that the Lord grant something, one receives benedictions according to his desires. If one wants to be elevated to the higher planetary systems, the heavenly planets, he can be promoted to the place he desires, and if one wants to remain a hog or a pig on earth, the Lord fulfills that desire also. Therefore, one\u2019s position is determined by one\u2019s desires; the Lord is not responsible for the higher or lower grades of our existence. This is further explained quite definitely in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25) by the Lord Himself: Some people want to be promoted to the heavenly planets, some want to be promoted to Pit\u1e5bloka, and some want to remain on earth, but if one is interested in returning home, back to Godhead, he can be promoted there also. According to the demands of a particular devotee, he receives a result by the grace of the Lord. The Lord does not discriminate, thinking, \u201cHere is a person favorable to Me, and here is a person who is not favorable.\u201d Rather, He fulfills the desires of everyone. Therefore the \u015b\u0101stras enjoin: \u201cWhether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous of all fruitive results, or is after liberation, one should with all efforts try to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection, culminating in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 2.3.10) According to one\u2019s position, whether as a devotee, a karm\u012b or a j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, whatever one wants one can get if one fully engages in the service of the Lord."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, because of my association with material desires, one after another, I was gradually falling into a blind well full of snakes, following the general populace. But Your servant N\u0101rada Muni kindly accepted me as his disciple and instructed me how to achieve this transcendental position. Therefore, my first duty is to serve him. How could I leave his service?",
        "purport": " As will be seen in later verses, even though Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was directly offered all the benedictions he might have desired, he refused to accept such offerings from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. On the contrary, he asked the Lord to engage him in the service of His servant N\u0101rada Muni. This is the symptom of a pure devotee. One should serve the spiritual master first. It is not that one should bypass the spiritual master and desire to serve the Supreme Lord. This is not the principle for a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says: One should not be anxious to offer direct service to the Lord. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu advised that one become a servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord (gop\u012b-bhartu\u1e25 pada-kamalayor d\u0101sa-d\u0101s\u0101nud\u0101sa\u1e25). This is the process for approaching the Supreme Lord. The first service should be rendered to the spiritual master so that by his mercy one can approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead to render service. While teaching R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu said, guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja: one can achieve the seed of devotional service by the mercy of the guru, the spiritual master, and then by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the secret of success. First one should try to please the spiritual master, and then one should attempt to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also says, yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101do. One should not attempt to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead by concoction. One must first be prepared to serve the spiritual master, and when one is qualified he is automatically offered the platform of direct service to the Lord. Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja proposed that he engage in the service of N\u0101rada Muni. He never proposed that he engage directly in the service of the Lord. This is the right conclusion. Therefore he said, so\u00a0\u2019ha\u1e41 katha\u1e41 nu vis\u1e5bje tava bh\u1e5btya-sev\u0101m: \u201cHow can I give up the service of my spiritual master, who has favored me in such a way that I am now able to see You face to face?\u201d Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja prayed to the Lord that he might continue to engage in the service of his spiritual master, N\u0101rada Muni."

He had said very angrily, \u201cIf there is any supreme controller other than me, let Him save you. I shall now sever your head from your body.\u201d Therefore I think that both in saving me and in killing him, You have acted just to prove true the words of Your devotee. There is no other cause.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.29) the Lord says: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is undoubtedly equal to everyone. He has no friend and no enemy, but as one desires benefits from the Lord, the Lord is very pleased to award them. The lower and higher positions of different living entities are due to their desires, for the Lord, being equal to all, fulfills everyone\u2019s desires. The killing of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and saving of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja also strictly followed this law of the supreme controller\u2019s activities. When Prahl\u0101da\u2019s mother, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s wife, Kay\u0101dhu, was under the protection of N\u0101rada, she prayed for the protection of her son from the enemy, and N\u0101rada Muni gave assurance that Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja would always be saved from the enemy\u2019s hands. Thus when Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was going to kill Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the Lord saved Prahl\u0101da to fulfill His promise in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati) and to prove true the words of N\u0101rada. The Lord can fulfill many purposes through one action. Thus the killing of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and the saving of Prahl\u0101da were enacted simultaneously to prove the truthfulness of the Lord\u2019s devotee and the fidelity of the Lord Himself to His own purpose. The Lord acts only to satisfy the desires of His devotees; otherwise He has nothing to do. As confirmed in the Vedic language, na tasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 kara\u1e47a\u1e41 ca vidyate: the Lord has nothing to do personally, for everything is done through His different potencies (par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate). The Lord has multifarious energies, through which everything is done. Thus when He personally does something, it is only to satisfy His devotee. The Lord is known as bhakta-vatsala because He very much favors His devoted servant."

In this way He exists in the entire cosmic manifestation. Therefore the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in maintaining His devotees are transcendental, not material. He exists in everything as the cause and effect, yet He is separate, existing beyond this cosmic manifestation. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.4): The entire cosmic manifestation is but an expansion of the Lord\u2019s energy; everything rests in Him, yet He exists separately, beyond creation, maintenance and annihilation. The varieties of creation are performed by His external energy. Because the energy and energetic are one, everything is one (sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma). Therefore without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Parabrahman, nothing can exist. The difference between the material and spiritual worlds is that His external energy is manifested in the material world, whereas His spiritual energy exists in the spiritual world. Both energies, however, belong to the Supreme Lord, and therefore in a higher sense there is no exhibition of material energy because everything is spiritual energy. The energy in which the Lord\u2019s all-pervasiveness is not realized is called material. Otherwise, everything is spiritual. Therefore Prahl\u0101da prays, ekas tvam eva jagad etam: \u201cYou are everything.\u201d"

        "translation": "My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, the entire cosmic creation is caused by You, and the cosmic manifestation is an effect of Your energy. Although the entire cosmos is but You alone, You keep Yourself aloof from it. The conception of \u201cmine and yours,\u201d is certainly a type of illusion [m\u0101y\u0101] because everything is an emanation from You and is therefore not different from You. Indeed, the cosmic manifestation is nondifferent from You, and the annihilation is also caused by You. This relationship between Your Lordship and the cosmos is illustrated by the example of the seed and the tree, or the subtle cause and the gross manifestation.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.10) the Lord says: \u201cO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, know that I am the original seed of all existences.\u201d In the Vedic literature it is said, \u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam, yato v\u0101 im\u0101ni bh\u016bt\u0101ni j\u0101yante and sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma. All this Vedic information indicates that there is only one God and that there is nothing else but Him. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers explain this in their own way, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead asserts the truth that He is everything and yet is separate from everything. This is the philosophy of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, which is called acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva. Everything is one, the Supreme Lord, yet everything is separate from the Lord. This is the understanding of oneness and difference. The example given in this regard \u2014 vasuk\u0101lavad a\u1e63\u1e6di-tarvo\u1e25 \u2014 is very easy to understand. Everything exists in time, yet there are different phases of the time factor \u2014 present, past and future. Present, past and future are one. Every day we can experience the time factor as morning, noon and evening, and although morning is different from noon, which is different from evening, all of them taken together are one. The time factor is the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Lord is separate from the time factor. Everything is created, maintained and annihilated by time, but the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, has no beginning and no end. He is nitya\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvata\u1e25 \u2014 eternal, permanent. Everything passes through time\u2019s phases of present, past and future, yet the Lord is always the same. Thus there is undoubtedly a difference between the Lord and the cosmic manifestation, but actually they are not different. Accepting them to be different is called avidy\u0101, ignorance. True oneness, however, is not equivalent to the conception of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs. The true understanding is that the differences are manifested by the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The seed is manifested as a tree, which displays varieties in its trunk, branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has therefore sung, ke\u015bava tuy\u0101 jagata vicitra: \u201cMy dear Lord, Your creation is full of varieties.\u201d The varieties are one and at the same time different. This is the philosophy of acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva. The conclusion given in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 is this: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes.\u201d Because the Lord is the supreme cause, everything is one with Him, but when we consider varieties, we find that one thing is different from another. We may conclude, therefore, that there is no difference between one thing and another, yet in varieties there are differences. In this regard, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya gives an example concerning a tree and a tree in fire. Both trees are the same, but they look different because of the time factor. The time factor is under the control of the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Supreme Lord is different from time. An advanced devotee consequently does not distinguish between happiness and distress. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.8): When a devotee is in a condition of so-called distress, he considers it a gift or blessing from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When a devotee is always thus situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in any condition of life, he is described as mukti-pade sa d\u0101ya-bh\u0101k, a perfect candidate for returning home, back to Godhead. The word d\u0101ya-bh\u0101k means \u201cinheritance.\u201d A son inherits the property of his father. Similarly, when the devotee is fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, undisturbed by dualities, he is sure that he will return home, back to Godhead, just as one inherits his father\u2019s property."

Yog\u012bs are advised to keep their eyes half closed, but this state is not at all one of sleep, although imitation yog\u012bs, especially in the modern age, manifest their so-called yoga by sleeping. In the \u015b\u0101stra, yoga is described as dhy\u0101n\u0101vasthita, a state of full meditation, but this is meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dhy\u0101n\u0101vasthita-tad-gatena manas\u0101: the mind should always be situated at the lotus feet of the Lord. Yoga practice does not mean sleeping. The mind should always be actively fixed at the lotus feet of the Lord. Then one\u2019s practice of yoga will be successful."

It is from this seed that the lotus flower of the gigantic universe is manifested, exactly as a banyan tree grows from a small seed.",
        "purport": " The three different forms of Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2014 namely K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who are the origin of creation and maintenance \u2014 are gradually being described. From Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is generated, and from Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u gradually expands. Thus Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the original cause of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and from Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u comes the lotus flower from which Lord Brahm\u0101 is manifested. Thus the original cause of everything is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and consequently the cosmic manifestation is not different from Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.8), wherein K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhavo matta\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 pravartate: \u201cI am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.\u201d Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is an expansion of K\u0101ra\u1e47odaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is an expansion of Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. In this way, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ultimately the cause of all causes (sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am). The conclusion is that both the material world and spiritual world are considered to be the body of the Supreme Lord. We can understand that the material body is caused by the spiritual body and is therefore an expansion of the spiritual body. Thus when one takes up spiritual activities, one\u2019s entire material body is spiritualized. Similarly, in this material world, when the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement expands, the entire material world becomes spiritualized. As long as we do not realize this, we live in the material world, but when we are fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious we live not in the material world but in the spiritual world."

Modern scientists have tried to explain the origin of creation by a chunk theory, but no one can explain how such a chunk might have burst. The Vedic literature, however, explains clearly that the total material energy was agitated by the three modes of material nature because of the glance of the Supreme Lord. In other words, in terms of the chunk theory, the bursting of the chunk was caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

        "translation": "Lord Brahm\u0101, who is celebrated as \u0101tma-yoni, having been born without a mother, was struck with wonder. Thus he took shelter of the lotus flower, and when he had been purified after undergoing severe austerities for many hundreds of years, he could see that the cause of all causes, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was spread throughout his own body and senses, just as aroma, although very subtle, is perceived in the earth.",
        "purport": " Here the statement of self-realization aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi, which is interpreted by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da philosophy to mean \u201cI am the Supreme Lord,\u201d is explained. The Supreme Lord is the original seed of everything (janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25; aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhavo matta\u1e25 sarva\u1e41 pravartate). Thus the Supreme Lord extends everywhere, even throughout our bodies, because our bodies are made of material energy, which is the Lord\u2019s separated energy. One should realize that since the Supreme Lord spreads throughout one\u2019s body and since the individual soul is a part of the Supreme Lord, everything is Brahman (sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma). This realization was achieved by Lord Brahm\u0101 after he was purified, and it is possible for everyone. When one is completely in knowledge of aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi, he thinks, \u201cI am part of the Supreme Lord, my body is made of His material energy, and therefore I have no separate existence. Yet although the Supreme Lord is spread everywhere, He is different from me.\u201d This is the philosophy of acintya-bhed\u0101bheda-tattva. An example given in this regard is that of the aroma within the earth. In the earth there are aromas and colors, but one cannot see them. Actually we find that when flowers grow from the earth, they appear with different colors and aromas, which they have certainly gathered from the earth, although in the earth we cannot see them. Similarly, the Supreme Lord, by His different energies, spreads throughout one\u2019s body and soul, although we cannot see Him. An intelligent man, however, can see the Supreme Lord existing everywhere. A\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham: the Lord is within the universe and within the atom by His different energies. This is the real vision of the Supreme Lord for the intelligent man. Brahm\u0101, the first created being, became the most intelligent person by his tapasya, austerity, and thus he came to this realization. We must therefore take all knowledge from Brahm\u0101, who became perfect by his tapasya."

You were very nicely dressed, being decorated and bedecked with varieties of ornaments and weapons. Seeing You in the form of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Your symptoms and form being transcendental, Your legs extending from the lower planets, Lord Brahm\u0101 achieved transcendental bliss.",
        "purport": " Lord Brahm\u0101, being completely pure, could see the original form of the Lord as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, having many thousands of faces and forms. This process is called self-realization. Genuine self-realization consists not of perceiving the impersonal effulgence of the Lord, but seeing face to face the transcendental form of the Lord. As distinctly mentioned here, Lord Brahm\u0101 saw the Supreme Lord as mah\u0101-puru\u1e63a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Arjuna also saw K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this same way. Therefore he told the Lord, para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n puru\u1e63a\u1e41 \u015b\u0101\u015bvata\u1e41 divyam: \u201cYou are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person.\u201d The Lord is parama-puru\u1e63a, the supreme form. Puru\u1e63a\u1e41 \u015b\u0101\u015bvatam: He is everlastingly the supreme enjoyer. It is not that the impersonal Brahman assumes a form; on the contrary, the impersonal Brahman effulgence is an emanation from the supreme form of the Lord. Upon being purified, Brahm\u0101 could see the supreme form of the Lord. The impersonal Brahman cannot have heads, noses, ears, hands and legs. This is not possible, for these are attributes of the Lord\u2019s form. The word m\u0101y\u0101mayam means \u201cspiritual knowledge.\u201d This is explained by Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya. M\u0101y\u0101maya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-svar\u016bpam. The word m\u0101y\u0101mayam, describing the Lord\u2019s form, should not be taken to mean illusion. Rather, the Lord\u2019s form is factual, and seeing this form is the result of perfect knowledge. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate. The word j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n refers to one who is perfectly in knowledge. Such a person can see the Personality of Godhead, and therefore he surrenders unto the Lord. The Lord\u2019s being symptomized by a face, nose, ears and so on is eternal. Without such a form, no one can be blissful. The Lord, however, is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, as stated in the \u015b\u0101stra (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25). When one is in perfect transcendental bliss, he can see the Lord\u2019s supreme form (vigraha). In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says: Lord Brahm\u0101 saw that as aromas and colors spread throughout the earth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead pervades the cosmic manifestation in a subtle form."

        "translation": "My dear Lord, when You appeared as Hayagr\u012bva, with the head of a horse, You killed two demons known as Madhu and Kai\u1e6dabha, who were full of the modes of passion and ignorance. Then You delivered the Vedic knowledge to Lord Brahm\u0101. For this reason, all the great saints accept Your forms as transcendental, untinged by material qualities.",
        "purport": " The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form is always ready to give protection to His devotees. As mentioned herein, the Lord in the form of Hayagr\u012bva killed two demons named Madhu and Kai\u1e6dabha when they attacked Lord Brahm\u0101. Modern demons think that there was no life in the beginning of creation, but from \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam we understand that the first living creature created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead was Lord Brahm\u0101, who is full of Vedic understanding. Unfortunately, those entrusted with distributing Vedic knowledge, such as the devotees engaged in spreading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, may sometimes be attacked by demons, but they must rest assured that demoniac attacks will not be able to harm them, for the Lord is always prepared to give them protection. The Vedas provide the knowledge by which we can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead (vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25). The devotees of the Lord are always ready to spread knowledge by which one may understand the Lord through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but the demons, being unable to understand the Supreme Lord, are full of ignorance and passion. Thus the Lord, whose form is transcendental, is always ready to kill the demons. By culturing the mode of goodness, one can understand the position of the transcendental Lord and how the Lord is always prepared to remove all obstacles on the path of understanding Him. In summary, whenever the Lord incarnates, He appears in His original transcendental form. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.7): \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself.\u201d It is simply foolish to think of the Lord as being originally impersonal but accepting a material body when He appears as a personal incarnation. Whenever the Lord appears, He appears in His original transcendental form, which is spiritual and blissful. But unintelligent men, such as the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, cannot understand the transcendental form of the Lord, and therefore the Lord chastises them by saying, avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam: \u201cFools deride Me when I descend in the human form.\u201d Whenever the Lord appears, whether as a fish, a tortoise, a hog or any other form, one should understand that He maintains His transcendental position and that His only business, as stated here, is hatv\u0101 \u2014 to kill the demons. The Lord appears in order to protect the devotees and kill the demons (paritr\u0101\u1e47\u0101ya s\u0101dh\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 vin\u0101\u015b\u0101ya ca du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m). Since the demons are always ready to oppose Vedic civilization, they are sure to be killed by the transcendental form of the Lord."

In the Age of Kali, however, You do not assert Yourself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore You are known as Triyuga, or the Lord who appears in three yugas.",

Similarly, Lord Caitanya appeared in order to protect the fallen souls of Kali-yuga. There are four yugas, or millenniums \u2014 Satya, Tret\u0101, Dv\u0101para and Kali. In all the yugas but Kali-yuga, the Lord appears in various incarnations and asserts Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but although Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who appears in Kali-yuga, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He never asserted Himself as such. On the contrary, whenever \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu was addressed as being as good as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He blocked His ears with His hands, denying His identity with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because He was playing the part of a devotee. Lord Caitanya knew that in Kali-yuga there would be many bogus incarnations pretending to be God, and therefore He avoided asserting Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, in many Vedic literatures, especially in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.32): In Kali-yuga, intelligent men worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who is always accompanied by His associates such as Nity\u0101nanda, Advaita, Gad\u0101dhara and \u015ar\u012bv\u0101sa. The entire K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is based on the principles of the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement inaugurated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. Therefore one who tries to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the medium of the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement knows everything perfectly. He is sumedhas, a person with substantial intelligence."

Prahl\u0101da is always situated in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets of the spiritual world, but on behalf of the fallen souls he asks how, when his mind is always disturbed by material things, he can discuss the transcendental position of the Lord. The mind becomes sinful because we are always engaged in sinful activities. Anything not connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be understood to be sinful. Indeed, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a demands in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.66): \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\u201d As soon as one surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a immediately relieves one of the reactions of sinful activities. Therefore one who is not surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord should be understood to be sinful, foolish, degraded among men and bereft of all real knowledge because of atheistic propensities. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.15): Therefore, especially in this Age of Kali, the mind must be cleansed, and this is possible only by the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. Ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam. In this age, the process of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra is the only method by which to cleanse the sinful mind. When the mind is completely cleansed of all sinful reactions, one can then understand his duty in the human form of life. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is meant to educate sinful men so that they may become pious simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. To cleanse the heart so that one may become sober and wise in this Age of Kali, there is no value to any method other than the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja has confirmed this process in previous verses. Tvad-v\u012brya-g\u0101yana-mah\u0101m\u1e5bta-magna-citta\u1e25. Prahl\u0101da further confirms that if one\u2019s mind is always absorbed in thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that very qualification will purify one and keep one purified always. To understand the Lord and His activities, one must free his mind from all contamination of the material world, and this one can achieve by simply chanting the Lord\u2019s holy name. Thus one becomes free from all material bondage."

The belly, although filled, still wants to eat more, and the ear, not attempting to hear about You, is generally attracted to cinema songs. The sense of smell is attracted to yet another side, the restless eyes are attracted to scenes of sense gratification, and the active senses are attracted elsewhere. In this way I am certainly embarrassed.",
        "purport": " The human form of life is meant for God realization, but this process, which begins with \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 \u2014 hearing and chanting of the holy name of the Lord \u2014 is disturbed as long as our senses are materially attracted. Therefore devotional service means purifying the senses. In the conditioned state our senses are covered by material sense gratification, and as long as one is not trained in purifying the senses, one cannot become a devotee. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, therefore, we advise from the very beginning that one restrict the activities of the senses, especially the tongue, which is described by \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura as most greedy and unconquerable. To stop this attraction of the tongue, one is authoritatively advised not to accept meat or similar uneatable things nor to allow the tongue to hanker to drink or smoke. Even the drinking of tea and coffee is not permitted. Similarly, the genitals must be restricted from illicit sex. Without such restraint of the senses, one cannot make advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The only method of controlling the senses is to chant and hear the holy name of the Lord; otherwise, one will always be disturbed, as a householder with more than one wife would be disturbed by them for sense gratification."

There are two classes of Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas \u2014 the bhajan\u0101nand\u012bs and go\u1e63\u1e6dhy-\u0101nand\u012bs. The bhajan\u0101nand\u012bs worship the Lord only for their own personal benefit, but the go\u1e63\u1e6dhy-\u0101nand\u012bs try to elevate all others to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that they may be saved. Fools who cannot perceive repeated birth and death and the other miseries of materialistic life cannot be sure of what will happen to them in their next birth. Indeed, these foolish, materially contaminated rascals have manufactured an irresponsible way of life that does not consider the next life. They do not know that according to one\u2019s own activities, one receives a body selected from 8,400,000 species. These rascals have been described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as du\u1e63k\u1e5btino m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25. Nondevotees, those who are not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, must engage in sinful activities, and therefore they are m\u016b\u1e0dhas \u2014 fools and rascals. They are such fools that they do not know what will happen to them in their next life. Although they see varieties of living creatures eating abominable things \u2014 pigs eating stool, crocodiles eating all kinds of flesh, and so on \u2014 they do not realize that they themselves, because of their practice of eating all kinds of nonsense in this life, will be destined to eat the most abominable things in their next life. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always afraid of such an abominable life, and to free himself from such horrible conditions, he engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord. The Lord is compassionate to them, and therefore He appears for their benefit. \u201cWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself.\u201d (Bg. 4.7) The Lord is always ready to help the fallen souls, but because they are fools and rascals, they do not take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and abide by the instructions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore although \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu is personally the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He comes as a devotee to preach the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement.

One should not be proud of becoming directly the servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, one must seek a pure devotee, a servant of the Lord, and engage oneself in the service of such a servant. The more one becomes the servant of the servant, the more one becomes perfect in devotional service.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a se tom\u0101ra, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a dite p\u0101ra. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the property of His pure devotee, and if we take shelter of a pure devotee, he can deliver K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very easily. Prahl\u0101da wants to engage in the service of a devotee, and therefore he prays to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u201cMy dear Lord, kindly give me the shelter of Your very dear devotee so that I may engage in his service and You may then be pleased.\u201d Mad-bhakta-p\u016bj\u0101bhyadhik\u0101 (Bh\u0101g. 11.19.21). The Lord says, \u201cEngaging in the service of My devotee is better than trying to engage in My devotional service.\u201d Another significant point in this verse is that by devotional service Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja does not want to benefit alone. Rather, he prays to the Lord that all of us fallen souls in this material world may, by the grace of the Lord, engage in the service of His servant and thus be delivered. The grace of the Lord is not at all difficult for the Lord to bestow, and thus Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wants to save the whole world by spreading K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

My concern is only for the fools and rascals who are making elaborate plans for material happiness and maintaining their families, societies and countries. I am simply concerned with love for them.",
        "purport": " Throughout the entire world, everyone is making big, big plans to adjust the miseries of the material world, and this is true at present, in the past and in the future. Nonetheless, although they make elaborate political, social and cultural plans, they have all been described herein as vim\u016b\u1e0dha \u2014 fools. The material world has been described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as du\u1e25kh\u0101layam a\u015b\u0101\u015bvatam \u2014 temporary and miserable \u2014 but these fools are trying to turn the material world into sukh\u0101layam, a place of happiness, not knowing how everything acts by the arrangement of material nature, which works in her own way. \u201cThe bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.\u201d (Bg. 3.27) There is a plan for material nature, personally known as Durg\u0101, to punish the demons. Although the asuras, the godless demons, struggle for existence, they are directly attacked by the goddess Durg\u0101, who is well equipped with ten hands with different types of weapons to punish them. She is carried by her lion carrier, or the modes of passion and ignorance. Everyone struggles very hard to fight through the modes of passion and ignorance and conquer material nature, but at the end everyone is vanquished by nature\u2019s laws. There is a river known as Vaitara\u1e47\u012b between the material and spiritual worlds, and one must cross this river to reach the other side, or the spiritual world. This is an extremely difficult task. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14), daiv\u012b hy e\u1e63\u0101 gu\u1e47amay\u012b mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101: \u201cThis divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.\u201d The same word duratyaya, meaning \u201cvery difficult,\u201d is used here. Therefore one cannot surpass the stringent laws of material nature except by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless, although all materialists are baffled in their plans, they try again and again to become happy in this material world. Therefore they have been described as vim\u016b\u1e0dha \u2014 first-class fools. As for Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, he was not at all unhappy, for although he was in the material world, he was full of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, trying to serve the Lord, are not unhappy, whereas one who has no assets in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and is struggling for existence is not only foolish but extremely unhappy also. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was happy and unhappy simultaneously. He felt happiness and transcendental bliss because of his being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, yet he felt great unhappiness for the fools and rascals who make elaborate plans to be happy in this material world."

Not caring for the big cities and towns, they go to the Him\u0101layas or the forest to meditate with vows of silence [mauna-vrata]. They are not interested in delivering others. As for me, however, I do not wish to be liberated alone, leaving aside all these poor fools and rascals. I know that without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, without taking shelter of Your lotus feet, one cannot be happy. Therefore I wish to bring them back to shelter at Your lotus feet.",
        "purport": " This is the decision of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, the pure devotee of the Lord. For himself he has no problems, even if he has to stay in this material world, because his only business is to remain in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can go even to hell and still be happy. Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said, naivodvije para duratyaya-vaitara\u1e47y\u0101\u1e25: \u201cO best of the great personalities, I am not at all afraid of material existence.\u201d The pure devotee is never unhappy in any condition of life. This is confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (6.17.28): \u201cDevotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, never fear any condition of life. For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord.\u201d For a devotee, being situated in the heavenly planets and being in the hellish planets are equal, for a devotee lives neither in heaven nor in hell but with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the spiritual world. The secret of success for the devotee is not understood by the karm\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs. Karm\u012bs therefore try to be happy by material adjustment, and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs want to be happy by becoming one with the Supreme. The devotee has no such interest. He is not interested in so-called meditation in the Him\u0101layas or the forest. Rather, his interest is in the busiest part of the world, where he teaches people K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement was started for this purpose. We do not teach one to meditate in a secluded place just so that one may show that he has become very much advanced and may be proud of his so-called transcendental meditation, although he engages in all sorts of foolish materialistic activity. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is not interested in such a bluff of spiritual advancement. Rather, he is interested in enlightening people in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because that is the only way for them to become happy. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja says clearly, n\u0101nya\u1e41 tvad asya \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 bhramato\u00a0\u2019nupa\u015bye: \u201cI know that without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, without taking shelter of Your lotus feet, one cannot be happy.\u201d One wanders within the universe, life after life, but by the grace of a devotee, a servant of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, one can get the clue to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and then not only become happy in this world but also return home, back to Godhead. That is the real target in life. The members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement are not at all interested in so-called meditation in the Him\u0101layas or the forest, where one will only make a show of meditation, nor are they interested in opening many schools for yoga and meditation in the cities. Rather, every member of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is interested in going door to door to try to convince people about the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is, the teachings of Lord Caitanya. That is the purpose of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement. The members of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement must be fully convinced that without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one cannot be happy. Thus the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person avoids all kinds of pseudo spiritualists, transcendentalists, meditators, monists, philosophers and philanthropists."

Unfortunately, however, because of a lack of education and culture, people are victimized by the false happiness of sex life. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore advises one not to be misled by this civilization of sense gratification, and especially not by sex life. Rather, one should be sober, avoid sense gratification and be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. The lusty person, who is compared to a foolish miser, never gets happiness by sense gratification. The influence of material nature is very difficult to surpass, but as stated by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14), m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante, m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te: if one voluntarily submits to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can be saved very easily. In reference to the low-grade happiness of sex life, Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya says in this connection: \u201cSince I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste.\u201d Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya had formerly been a great king who enjoyed sexual happiness in various ways, but since he later engaged himself in the service of the Lord, he enjoyed spiritual bliss and hated to think of sex life. If sexual thoughts came to him, he would spit with disgust."

        "translation": "O Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are ten prescribed methods on the path to liberation \u2014 to remain silent, not to speak to anyone, to observe vows, to amass all kinds of Vedic knowledge, to undergo austerities, to study the Vedas and other Vedic literatures, to execute the duties of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, to explain the \u015b\u0101stras, to stay in a solitary place, to chant mantras silently, and to be absorbed in trance. These different methods for liberation are generally only a professional practice and means of livelihood for those who have not conquered their senses. Because such persons are falsely proud, these procedures may not be successful.",
        "purport": " As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (6.1.15): \u201cOnly a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can uproot the weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will revive. He can do this simply by discharging devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays.\u201d The real purpose of human life is to attain liberation from material entanglement. Such liberation may be achieved by many methods (tapas\u0101 brahmacarye\u1e47a \u015bamena ca damena ca), but all of them more or less depend on tapasya, austerity, which begins with celibacy. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that those who are v\u0101sudeva-par\u0101ya\u1e47a, who have fully surrendered to the lotus feet of Lord V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, automatically achieve the results of mauna (silence), vrata (vows) and other such methods simply by discharging devotional service. In other words, these methods are not so powerful. If one takes to devotional service, all of them are very easily performed. Mauna, for example, does not mean that one should just stop speaking. The tongue is meant for speaking, although sometimes, to make a big show, a person remains silent. There are many who observe silence some day in a week. Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, however, do not observe such silence. Silence means not speaking foolishly. Speakers at assemblies, conferences and meetings generally speak foolishly like toads. This is described by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as v\u0101co vegam. One who wants to say something can show himself to be a big orator, but rather than go on speaking nonsense, better to remain silent. This method of silence, therefore, is recommended for persons very attached to speaking nonsense. One who is not a devotee must speak nonsensically because he does not have the power to speak about the glories of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus whatever he says is influenced by the illusory energy and is compared to the croaking of a frog. One who speaks about the glories of the Lord, however, has no need to be silent. Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu recommends, k\u012brtan\u012bya\u1e25 sad\u0101 hari\u1e25: one should go on chanting the glories of the Lord twenty-four hours a day. There is no question of becoming mauna, or silent. The ten processes for liberation or improvement on the path of liberation are not meant for the devotees. Kevalay\u0101 bhakty\u0101: if one simply engages in devotional service to the Lord, all ten methods of liberation are automatically observed. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s proposal is that such processes may be recommended for the ajitendriya, those who cannot conquer their senses. Devotees, however, have already conquered their senses. Sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41 tat-paratvena nirmalam: a devotee is already freed from material contamination. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore said: There are many who like to chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra in a silent, solitary place, but if one is not interested in preaching, talking constantly to the nondevotees, the influence of the modes of nature is very difficult to surpass. Therefore unless one is extremely advanced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one should not imitate Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura, who had no other business than chanting the holy name always, twenty-four hours a day. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja does not condemn such a process; he accepts it, but without active service to the Lord, simply by such methods one generally cannot attain liberation. One cannot attain liberation simply by false pride."

These may be very attractive, but by following such methods, one cannot actually understand the real cause and effect and the original cause of everything (janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25). The original source of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself (sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am).

The intelligent person, the devotee, does not bother much about the practices mentioned in text 46 (mauna-vrata-\u015bruta-tapo-\u2019dhyayana-sva-dharma). After understanding the Supreme Lord through devotional service, such devotees are no longer interested in studies of the Vedas. Indeed, this is confirmed in the Vedas also. The Vedas say, kim arth\u0101 vayam adhye\u1e63y\u0101mahe kim arth\u0101 vayam vak\u1e63y\u0101mahe. What is the use of studying so many Vedic literatures? What is the use of explaining them in different ways? Vayam vak\u1e63y\u0101mahe. No one needs to study any more Vedic literatures, nor does anyone need to describe them by philosophical speculation. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.52) also says: When one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing devotional service, one ceases the practice of studying the Vedic literature. Elsewhere it is said, \u0101r\u0101dhito yadi haris tapas\u0101 tata\u1e25 kim. If one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engage in His service, there is no more need of severe austerities, penances and so on. However, if after performing severe austerities and penances one does not understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such practices are useless."

One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by studying the Vedas and offering prayers. Only by the grace of the Supreme Lord can one understand Him. The process of understanding the Lord, therefore, is bhakti. Without bhakti, simply following the Vedic injunctions to understand the Absolute Truth will not be helpful at all. The process of bhakti is understood by the paramaha\u1e41sa, one who has accepted the essence of everything. The results of bhakti are reserved for such a paramaha\u1e41sa, and this stage cannot be obtained by any Vedic process other than devotional service. Other processes, such as j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga, can be successful only when mixed with bhakti. When we speak of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, karma-yoga and dhy\u0101na-yoga the word yoga indicates bhakti. Bhakti-yoga, or buddhi-yoga, executed with intelligence and full knowledge, is the only successful method for going back home, back to Godhead. If one wants to be liberated from the pangs of material existence, he should take to devotional service for quick attainment of this goal."
