Of course, atheistic men do not follow the instructions of pure devotees, but instead consider a devotee their enemy. A devotee, however, never creates a situation of friendship and enmity.

Sometimes we have to challenge big scientists and philosophers, but by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a we emerge successful. It is impossible, practically speaking, for ordinary men to challenge scientists or philosophers concerning genuine knowledge, but a devotee can challenge them because the best of everything is known to a devotee by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

As a special favor, He enlightens the devotee with all knowledge by putting before him the torch of light. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, therefore, knew the best of knowledge, and when his father inquired from him, Prahl\u0101da gave him that knowledge. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was able to solve the most difficult parts of problems because of his advanced K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore he replied as follows."

        "translation": "Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja replied: O best of the asuras, King of the demons, as far as I have learned from my spiritual master, any person who has accepted a temporary body and temporary household life is certainly embarrassed by anxiety because of having fallen in a dark well where there is no water but only suffering. One should give up this position and go to the forest [vana]. More clearly, one should go to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is prevalent, and should thus take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu thought that Prahl\u0101da, being nothing but a small boy with no actual experience, might reply with something pleasing but nothing practical. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, being an exalted devotee, had acquired all the qualities of education. \u201cOne who has unflinching devotional faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consistently manifests all the good qualities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the demigods. However, he who has no devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no good qualifications because he is engaged by mental concoction in material existence, which is the external feature of the Lord.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.18.12) So-called educated philosophers and scientists who are simply on the mental platform cannot distinguish between what is actually sat, eternal, and what is asat, temporary. The Vedic injunction is asato m\u0101 jyotir gama: everyone should give up the platform of temporary existence and approach the eternal platform. The soul is eternal, and topics concerning the eternal soul are actually knowledge. Elsewhere it is said, apa\u015byat\u0101m \u0101tma-tattva\u1e41 g\u1e5bhe\u1e63u g\u1e5bha-medhin\u0101m: those who are attached to the bodily conception of life and who thus stick to life as a g\u1e5bhastha, or householder, on the platform of material sense enjoyment, cannot see the welfare of the eternal soul. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja confirmed this by saying that if one wants success in life, he should immediately understand from the right sources what his self-interest is and how he should mold his life in spiritual consciousness. One should understand himself to be part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thus completely take shelter of His lotus feet for guaranteed spiritual success. Everyone in the material world is in the bodily conception, struggling hard for existence, life after life. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja therefore recommended that to stop this material condition of repeated birth and death, one should go to the forest (vana). In the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, one first becomes a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, then a g\u1e5bhastha, a v\u0101naprastha and finally a sanny\u0101s\u012b. Going to the forest means accepting v\u0101naprastha life, which is between g\u1e5bhastha life and sanny\u0101sa. As confirmed in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (3.8.9), var\u1e47\u0101\u015bram\u0101c\u0101ravat\u0101 puru\u1e63e\u1e47a para\u1e25 pum\u0101n vi\u1e63\u1e47ur \u0101r\u0101dhyate: by accepting the institution of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama, one can very easily elevate himself to the platform of worshiping Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Otherwise, if one remains in the bodily conception, one must rot within this material world, and his life will be a failure. Society must have divisions of br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra, and for spiritual advancement one must gradually develop as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101s\u012b. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja recommended that his father accept v\u0101naprastha life because as a g\u1e5bhastha he was becoming increasingly demoniac due to bodily attachment. Prahl\u0101da recommended to his father that accepting v\u0101naprastha life would be better than going deeper and deeper into g\u1e5bham andha-k\u016bpam, the blind well of life as a g\u1e5bhastha. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement we therefore invite all the elderly persons of the world to come to V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and stay there in retired life, making advancement in spiritual consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Therefore the word para-pak\u1e63a (\u201con the side of the enemy\u201d) is used here. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu never agreed with the words of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Rather, he was angered by the intelligence of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, says, sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja \u2014 \u201cGive up all other duties and surrender unto Me\u201d \u2014 but demons like Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu never agree to do this.

Such persons, being m\u016b\u1e0dha and nar\u0101dhama \u2014 fools and rascals, the lowest of men \u2014 would never accept Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as the Supreme and surrender to Him. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu naturally became increasingly angry that his son Prahl\u0101da was being influenced by the camp of the enemies. He therefore asked that saintly persons like N\u0101rada not be allowed within the residential quarters of his son, for otherwise Prahl\u0101da would be further spoiled by Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava instructions."

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not at all to the liking of the demons of the present age. As soon as they see a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava dressed in saffron garments with beads on his neck and tilaka on his forehead, they are immediately irritated. They criticize the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas by sarcastically saying Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and some people also chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sincerely. In either case, since Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute, whether one chants it jokingly or sincerely, it will have its effect. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas are pleased when the demons chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because this shows that the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement is taking ground. The greater demons, like Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, are always prepared to chastise the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, and they try to make arrangements so that Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas will not come to sell their books and preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Thus what was done by Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu long, long ago is still being done. That is the way of materialistic life. Demons or materialists do not at all like the advancement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and they try to hinder it in many ways. Yet the preachers of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness must go forward \u2014 in their Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava dress or any other dress \u2014 for the purpose of preaching. C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita says that if an honest person deals with a great cheater, it is necessary for him to become a cheater also, not for the purpose of cheating but to make his preaching successful."

        "translation": "Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja replied: Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose external energy has created the distinctions of \u201cmy friend\u201d and \u201cmy enemy\u201d by deluding the intelligence of men. Indeed, I am now actually experiencing this, although I have previously heard of it from authoritative sources.",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.18): \u201cThe humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].\u201d Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25, those who are actually learned \u2014 the equipoised, advanced devotees who have full knowledge of everything \u2014 do not see any living entity as an enemy or friend. Instead, with broader vision, they see that everyone is part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as confirmed by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu (j\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa\u2019). Every living entity, being part of the Supreme Lord, is meant to serve the Lord, just as every part of the body is meant to serve the whole body. As servants of the Supreme Lord, all living entities are one, but a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, because of his natural humility, addresses every other living entity as prabhu. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sees other servants to be so advanced that he has much to learn from them. Thus he accepts all other devotees of the Lord as prabhus, masters. Although everyone is a servant of the Lord, one Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava servant, because of humility, sees another servant as his master. Understanding of the master begins from understanding of the spiritual master. \u201cBy the mercy of the spiritual master one receives the benediction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without the grace of the spiritual master, one cannot make any advancement.\u201d \u201cThe spiritual master is to be honored as much as the Supreme Lord because he is the most confidential servitor of the Lord. This is acknowledged in all revealed scriptures and followed by all authorities. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master, who is a bona fide representative of \u015ar\u012b Hari [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a].\u201d The spiritual master, the servant of God, is engaged in the most confidential service of the Lord, namely delivering all the conditioned souls from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, in which one thinks, \u201cThis person is my enemy, and that one is my friend.\u201d Actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the friend of all living entities, and all living entities are eternal servants of the Supreme Lord. Oneness is possible through this understanding, not through artificially thinking that every one of us is God or equal to God. The true understanding is that God is the supreme master and that all of us are servants of the Supreme Lord and are therefore on the same platform. This had already been taught to Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja by his spiritual master, N\u0101rada, but Prahl\u0101da was nonetheless surprised by how a bewildered soul thinks one person his enemy and another his friend. As long as one adheres to the philosophy of duality, thinking one person a friend and another an enemy, he should be understood to be in the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosopher who thinks that all living entities are God and are therefore one is also mistaken. No one is equal to God. The servant cannot be equal to the master. According to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy, the master is one, and the servants are also one, but the distinction between the master and servant must continue even in the liberated stage. In the conditioned stage we think that some living beings are our friends whereas others are enemies, and thus we are in duality. In the liberated stage, however, the conception is that God is the master and that all living entities, being servants of God, are one."

        "translation": "When the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased with the living entity because of his devotional service, one becomes a pa\u1e47\u1e0dita and does not make distinctions between enemies, friends and himself. Intelligently, he then thinks, \u201cEvery one of us is an eternal servant of God, and therefore we are not different from one another.\u201d",
        "purport": " When Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s teachers and demoniac father asked him how his intelligence had been polluted, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said, \u201cAs far as I am concerned, my intelligence has not been polluted. Rather, by the grace of my spiritual master and by the grace of my Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I have now learned that no one is my enemy and no one is my friend. We are all actually eternal servants of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but under the influence of the external energy we think that we are separately situated from the Supreme Personality of Godhead as friends and enemies of one another. This mistaken idea has now been corrected, and therefore, unlike ordinary human beings, I no longer think that I am God and that others are my friends and enemies. Now I am rightly thinking that everyone is an eternal servant of God and that our duty is to serve the supreme master, for then we shall stand on the platform of oneness as servants.\u201d Demons think of everyone as a friend or enemy, but Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas say that since everyone is a servant of the Lord, everyone is on the same platform. Therefore a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava treats other living entities neither as friends nor as enemies, but instead tries to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, teaching everyone that we are all one as servants of the Supreme Lord but are uselessly wasting our valuable lives by creating nations, communities and other groups of friends and enemies. Everyone should come to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thus feel oneness as a servant of the Lord. Although there are 8,400,000 species of life, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava feels this oneness. The \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad advises, ekatvam anupa\u015byata\u1e25. A devotee should see the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be situated in everyone\u2019s heart and should also see every living entity as an eternal servant of the Lord. This vision is called ekatvam, oneness. Although there is a relationship of master and servant, both master and servant are one because of their spiritual identity. This is also ekatvam. Thus the conception of ekatvam for the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is different from that of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu asked Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja how he had become antagonistic to his family. When a family member is killed by an enemy, all the members of the family would naturally be inimical to the murderer, but Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu saw that Prahl\u0101da had become friendly with the murderer. Therefore he asked, \u201cWho has created this kind of intelligence in you? Have you developed this consciousness by yourself? Since you are a small boy, someone must have induced you to think this way.\u201d Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted to reply that an attitude favorable toward Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can develop only when the Lord is favorable (sa yad\u0101nuvrata\u1e25). As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the friend of everyone (suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 \u015b\u0101ntim \u1e5bcchati). The Lord is never an enemy to any of the millions of living entities, but is always a friend to everyone. This is true understanding. If one thinks that the Lord is an enemy, his intelligence is pa\u015bu-buddhi, the intelligence of an animal. He falsely thinks, \u201cI am different from my enemy, and my enemy is different from me. The enemy has done this, and therefore my duty is to kill him.\u201d This misconception is described in this verse as bheda-gat\u0101sat\u012b. The actual fact is that everyone is a servant of the Lord, as confirmed in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu (j\u012bvera \u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa\u2019). As servants of the Lord, we are one, and there can be no questions of enmity or friendship. If one actually understands that every one of us is a servant of the Lord, where is the question of enemy or friend? Everyone should be friendly for the service of the Lord. Everyone should praise another\u2019s service to the Lord and not be proud of his own service. This is the way of Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava thinking, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha thinking. There may be rivalries and apparent competition between servants in performing service, but in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets the service of another servant is appreciated, not condemned. This is Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha competition. There is no question of enmity between servants. Everyone should be allowed to render service to the Lord to the best of his ability, and everyone should appreciate the service of others. Such are the activities of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Since everyone is a servant, everyone is on the same platform and is allowed to serve the Lord according to his ability. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15), sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6do matta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca: the Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, giving dictation according to the attitude of the servant. However, the Lord gives different dictation to the nondevotees and devotees. The nondevotees challenge the authority of the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Lord dictates in such a way that the nondevotees forget the Lord\u2019s service, life after life, and are punished by the laws of nature. But when a devotee very sincerely wants to render service to the Lord, the Lord dictates in a different way. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10): \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d Everyone is actually a servant, not an enemy or friend, and everyone is working under different directions from the Lord, who directs each living entity according to his mentality."

        "purport": " For iron to be attracted by a magnet is natural. Similarly, for all living entities to be attracted toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is natural, and therefore the Lord\u2019s real name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, meaning He who attracts everyone and everything. The typical examples of such attraction are found in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where everything and everyone is attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The elderly persons like Nanda Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Ya\u015bod\u0101dev\u012b, the friends like \u015ar\u012bd\u0101m\u0101, Sud\u0101m\u0101 and the other cowherd boys, the gop\u012bs like \u015ar\u012bmat\u012b R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u012b and Her associates, and even the birds, beasts, cows and calves are attracted. The flowers and fruits in the gardens are attracted, the waves of the Yamun\u0101 are attracted, and the land, sky, trees, plants, animals and all other living beings are attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the natural situation of everything in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Just contrary to the affairs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is the material world, where no one is attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and everyone is attracted by m\u0101y\u0101. This is the difference between the spiritual and material worlds. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, who was in the material world, was attracted by women and money, whereas Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, being in his natural position, was attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In replying to Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s question about why Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had a deviant view, Prahl\u0101da said that his view was not deviant, for the natural position of everyone is to be attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu found this view deviant, Prahl\u0101da said, because of being unnaturally unattracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu therefore needed purification. As soon as one is purified of material contamination, he is again attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41 tat-paratvena nirmalam). In the material world, everyone is contaminated by the dirt of sense gratification and is acting according to different designations, sometimes as a human being, sometimes a beast, sometimes a demigod or tree, and so on. One must be cleansed of all these designations. Then one will be naturally attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The bhakti process purifies the living entity of all unnatural attractions. When one is purified he is attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and begins to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instead of serving m\u0101y\u0101. This is his natural position. A devotee is attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whereas a nondevotee, being contaminated by the dirt of material enjoyment, is not. This is confirmed by the Lord in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.28): \u201cPersons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination.\u201d One must be freed from all the sinful dirt of material existence. Everyone in this material world is contaminated by material desire. Unless one is free from all material desire (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam), one cannot be attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

        "purport": " In political affairs, when a person disobediently agitates against the government, four principles are used to suppress him \u2014 legal orders, pacification, the offer of a post, or, finally, weapons. When there are no other arguments, he is punished. In logic, this is called argumentum ad baculum. When the two seminal br\u0101hma\u1e47as \u1e62a\u1e47\u1e0da and Amarka failed to extract from Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja the cause for his having opinions different from those of his father, they called for a stick with which to chastise him to satisfy their master, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. Because Prahl\u0101da had become a devotee, they considered him to be contaminated by bad intelligence and to be the worst descendant in the family of demons. As it is said, where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise. In a society or family in which everyone is a demon, for someone to become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is certainly folly. Thus Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was charged with bad intelligence because he was among demons, including his teachers, who were supposedly br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The members of our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement are in a position similar to that of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. All over the world, ninety-nine percent of the people are godless demons, and therefore our preaching of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, following in the footsteps of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, is always hampered by many impediments. Because of their fault of being devotees, the American boys who have sacrificed everything for preaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are charged with being members of the CIA. Moreover, the seminal br\u0101hma\u1e47as in India, who say that one can become a br\u0101hma\u1e47a only if born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family, charge us with ruining the Hindu system of religion. Of course, the fact is that one becomes a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by qualification. Because we are training Europeans and Americans to become qualified and are awarding them brahminical status, we are being charged with destroying the Hindu religion. Nonetheless, confronting all kinds of difficulties, we must spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement with great determination, like that of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. In spite of being the son of the demon Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, Prahl\u0101da never feared the chastisements of the seminal br\u0101hma\u1e47a sons of a demoniac father."

        "purport": " In this verse the words prahr\u0101da\u1e41 gr\u0101hay\u0101m \u0101sa are important. The words gr\u0101hay\u0101m \u0101sa literally mean that they tried to induce Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to accept the paths of dharma, artha and k\u0101ma (religion, economic development and sense gratification). People are generally preoccupied with these three concerns, without interest in the path of liberation. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, the father of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, was simply interested in gold and sense enjoyment. The word hira\u1e47ya means \u201cgold,\u201d and ka\u015bipu refers to soft cushions and bedding on which people enjoy sense gratification. The word prahl\u0101da, however, refers to one who is always joyful in understanding Brahman (brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101). Prahl\u0101da means prasann\u0101tm\u0101, always joyful. Prahl\u0101da was always joyful in worshiping the Lord, but in accordance with the instructions of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, the teachers were interested in teaching him about material things. Materialistic persons think that the path of religion is meant for improving their material conditions. The materialist goes to a temple to worship many varieties of demigods just to receive some benediction to improve his material life. He goes to a s\u0101dhu or so-called sv\u0101m\u012b to take advantage of an easy method for achieving material opulence. In the name of religion, the so-called s\u0101dhus try to satisfy the senses of the materialists by showing them shortcuts to material opulence. Sometimes they give some talisman or blessing. Sometimes they attract materialistic persons by producing gold. Then they declare themselves God, and foolish materialists are attracted to them for economic development. As a result of this process of cheating, others are reluctant to accept a religious process, and instead they advise people in general to work for material advancement. This is going on all over the world. Not only now but since time immemorial, no one is interested in mok\u1e63a, liberation. There are four principles \u2014 dharma (religion), artha (economic development), k\u0101ma (sense gratification) and mok\u1e63a (liberation). People accept religion to become materially opulent. And why should one be materially opulent? For sense gratification. Thus people prefer these three m\u0101rgas, the three paths of materialistic life. No one is interested in liberation, and bhagavad-bhakti, devotional service to the Lord, is above even liberation. Therefore the process of devotional service, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is extremely difficult to understand. This will be explained later by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. The teachers \u1e62a\u1e47\u1e0da and Amarka tried to induce Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to accept the materialistic way of life, but actually their attempt was a failure."

Therefore, when a citizen agitates the public against the king, the duty of the king is to call him and try to pacify him with sweet words, saying, \u201cYou are very important in the state. Why should you disturb the public with some new cause for agitation?\u201d If the citizen is not pacified, the king should then offer him some lucrative post as a governor or minister \u2014 any post that draws a high salary \u2014 so that he may be agreeable. If the enemy still goes on agitating the public, the king should try to create dissension in the enemy\u2019s camp, but if he still continues, the king should employ argumentum ad baculum \u2014 severe punishment \u2014 by putting him in jail or placing him before a firing squad. The teachers appointed by Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu taught Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja how to be a diplomat so that he could rule over the citizens very nicely."

To execute devotional service, one should always engage in hearing and chanting about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The process of temple worship is called arcana. How to perform arcana will be explained herein. One should have complete faith in the words of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who says that He is the great well-wishing friend of everyone (suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m). A devotee considers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the only friend. This is called sakhyam. Pu\u1e41s\u0101rpit\u0101 vi\u1e63\u1e47au. The word pu\u1e41s\u0101 means \u201cby all living entities.\u201d There are no distinctions permitting only a man or only a br\u0101hma\u1e47a to offer devotional service to the Lord. Everyone can do so. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.32), striyo vai\u015by\u0101s tath\u0101 \u015b\u016bdr\u0101s te\u00a0\u2019pi y\u0101nti par\u0101\u1e41 gatim: although women, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras are considered less intelligent, they also can become devotees and return home, back to Godhead. After performing sacrifices, sometimes a person engaged in fruitive activity customarily offers the results to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. But here it is said, bhagavaty addh\u0101: one must directly offer everything to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This is called sanny\u0101sa (not merely ny\u0101sa). A trida\u1e47\u1e0di-sanny\u0101s\u012b carries three da\u1e47\u1e0das, signifying kaya-mano-v\u0101kya \u2014 body, mind and words. All of these should be offered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and then one can begin devotional service. Fruitive workers first perform some pious activities and then formally or officially offer the results to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The real devotee, however, first offers his surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with his body, mind and words and then uses his body, mind and words for the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desires. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura gives the following explanation in his Tathya. The word \u015brava\u1e47a refers to giving aural reception to the holy name and descriptions of the Lord\u2019s form, qualities, entourage and pastimes as explained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and similar authorized scriptures. After aurally receiving such messages, one should memorize these vibrations and repeat them (k\u012brtanam). Smara\u1e47am means trying to understand more and more about the Supreme Lord, and p\u0101da-sevanam means engaging oneself in serving the lotus feet of the Lord according to the time and circumstances. Arcanam means worshiping Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as one does in the temple, and vandanam means offering respectful obeisances. Man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakto mad-y\u0101j\u012b m\u0101\u1e41 namaskuru. Vandanam means namaskuru \u2014 offering obeisances or offering prayers. Thinking oneself to be nitya-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-d\u0101sa, everlastingly a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is called d\u0101syam, and sakhyam means being a well-wisher of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants everyone to surrender unto Him because everyone is constitutionally His servant. Therefore, as a sincere friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one should preach this philosophy, requesting everyone to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. \u0100tma-nivedanam means offering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everything, including one\u2019s body, mind, intelligence and whatever one may possess. One\u2019s sincere endeavor to perform these nine processes of devotional service is technically called bhakti. The word addh\u0101 means \u201cdirectly.\u201d One should not be like the karm\u012bs, who perform pious activities and then formally offer the results to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. One should not aspire for the results of his pious activities, but should dedicate oneself fully and then act piously. In other words, one should act for the satisfaction of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, not for the satisfaction of his own senses. That is the meaning of the word addh\u0101, \u201cdirectly.\u201d \u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\u201d One should simply satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without being influenced by fruitive knowledge or fruitive activity. The Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad says that the word bhakti means engagement in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not of anyone else. This Upani\u1e63ad describes that bhakti is the offering of devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To perform devotional service, one should be relieved of the bodily conception of life and aspirations to be happy through elevation to the higher planetary systems. In other words, work performed simply for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, without any desire for material benefits, is called bhakti. Bhakti is also called ni\u1e63karma, or freedom from the results of fruitive activity. Bhakti and ni\u1e63karma are on the same platform, although devotional service and fruitive activity appear almost the same. The nine different processes enunciated by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who learned them from N\u0101rada Muni, may not all be required for the execution of devotional service; if a devotee performs only one of these nine without deviation, he can attain the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes it is found that when one performs one of the processes, other processes are mixed with it. That is not improper for a devotee. When a devotee executes any one of the nine processes (nava-lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101), this is sufficient; the other eight processes are included. Now let us discuss these nine different processes. (1) \u015arava\u1e47am. Hearing of the holy name of the Lord (\u015brava\u1e47am) is the beginning of devotional service. Although any one of the nine processes is sufficient, in chronological order the hearing of the holy name of the Lord is the beginning. Indeed, it is essential. As enunciated by Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam: by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one is cleansed of the material conception of life, which is due to the dirty modes of material nature. When the dirt is cleansed from the core of one\u2019s heart, one can realize the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25. Thus by hearing the holy name of the Lord, one comes to the platform of understanding the personal form of the Lord. After realizing the Lord\u2019s form, one can realize the transcendental qualities of the Lord, and when one can understand His transcendental qualities one can understand the Lord\u2019s associates. In this way a devotee advances further and further toward complete understanding of the Lord as he awakens in realization of the Lord\u2019s holy name, transcendental form and qualities, His paraphernalia, and everything pertaining to Him. Therefore the chronological process is \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. This same process of chronological understanding holds true in chanting and remembering. When the chanting of the holy name, form, qualities and paraphernalia is heard from the mouth of a pure devotee, his hearing and chanting are very pleasing. \u015ar\u012bla San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b has forbidden us to hear the chanting of an artificial devotee or nondevotee. Hearing from the text of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is considered the most important process of hearing. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is full of transcendental chanting of the holy name, and therefore the chanting and hearing of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam are transcendentally full of mellows. The transcendental holy name of the Lord may be heard and chanted accordingly to the attraction of the devotee. One may chant the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or one may chant the holy name of Lord R\u0101ma or N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva (r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan). The Lord has innumerable forms and names, and devotees may meditate upon a particular form and chant the holy name according to his attraction. The best course is to hear of the holy name, form and so on from a pure devotee of the same standard as oneself. In other words, one who is attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should chant and hear from other pure devotees who are also attached to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The same principle applies for devotees attracted by Lord R\u0101ma, Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha and other forms of the Lord. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate form of the Lord (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam), it is best to hear about Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, form and pastimes from a realized devotee who is particularly attracted by the form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, great devotees like \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b have specifically described Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s holy name, form and qualities. Unless one hears about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord, one cannot clearly understand the other processes of devotional service. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu recommends that one chant the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Para\u1e41 vijayate \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtanam. If one is fortunate enough to hear from the mouth of realized devotees, he is very easily successful on the path of devotional service. Therefore hearing of the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord is essential. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.11) there is this verse: \u201cVerses describing the name, form and qualities of Anantadeva, the unlimited Supreme Lord, are able to vanquish all the sinful reactions of the entire world. Therefore even if such verses are improperly composed, devotees hear them, describe them and accept them as bona fide and authorized.\u201d In this connection, \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b has remarked that a pure devotee takes advantage of another pure devotee by trying to hear from him about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord. If there is no such opportunity, he alone chants and hears the Lord\u2019s holy name. (2) K\u012brtanam. The hearing of the holy name has been described above. Now let us try to understand the chanting of the holy name, which is the second item in the consecutive order. It is recommended that such chanting be performed very loudly. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, N\u0101rada Muni says that without shame he began traveling all over the world, chanting the holy name of the Lord. Similarly, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has advised: A devotee can very peacefully chant the holy name of the Lord by behaving more humbly than the grass, being tolerant like a tree and offering respects to everyone, without expecting honor from anyone else. Such qualifications make it easier to chant the holy name of the Lord. The process of transcendental chanting can be easily performed by anyone. Even if one is physically unfit, classified lower than others, devoid of material qualifications or not at all elevated in terms of pious activities, the chanting of the holy name is beneficial. An aristocratic birth, an advanced education, beautiful bodily features, wealth and similar results of pious activities are all unnecessary for advancement in spiritual life, for one can very easily advance simply by chanting the holy name. It is understood from the authoritative source of Vedic literature that especially in this age, Kali-yuga, people are generally short-living, extremely bad in their habits, and inclined to accept methods of devotional service that are not bona fide. Moreover, they are always disturbed by material conditions, and they are mostly unfortunate. Under the circumstances, the performance of other processes, such as yaj\u00f1a, d\u0101na, tapa\u1e25 and kriy\u0101 \u2014 sacrifices, charity and so on \u2014 are not at all possible. Therefore it is recommended: \u201cIn this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting of the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.\u201d Simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one advances perfectly in spiritual life. This is the best process for success in life. In other ages, the chanting of the holy name is equally powerful, but especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is most powerful. K\u012brtan\u0101d eva k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47asya mukta-sa\u1e45ga\u1e25 para\u1e41 vrajet: simply by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is liberated and returns home, back to Godhead. Therefore, even if one is able to perform other processes of devotional service, one must adopt the chanting of the holy name as the principal method of advancing in spiritual life. Yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25: those who are very sharp in their intelligence should adopt this process of chanting the holy names of the Lord. One should not, however, manufacture different types of chanting. One should adhere seriously to the chanting of the holy name as recommended in the scriptures: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. While chanting the holy name of the Lord, one should be careful to avoid ten offenses. From Sanat-kum\u0101ra it is understood that even if a person is a severe offender in many ways, he is freed from offensive life if he takes shelter of the Lord\u2019s holy name. Indeed, even if a human being is no better than a two-legged animal, he will be liberated if he takes shelter of the holy name of the Lord. One should therefore be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord\u2019s holy name. The offenses are described as follows: (a) to blaspheme a devotee, especially a devotee engaged in broadcasting the glories of the holy name, (b) to consider the name of Lord \u015aiva or any other demigod to be equally as powerful as the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (no one is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor is anyone superior to Him), (c) to disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, (d) to blaspheme the Vedic literatures and literatures compiled in pursuance of the Vedic literatures, (e) to comment that the glories of the holy name of the Lord are exaggerated, (f) to interpret the holy name in a deviant way, (g) to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, (h) to compare the chanting of the holy name to pious activities, (i) to instruct the glories of the holy name to a person who has no understanding of the chanting of the holy name, (j) not to awaken in transcendental attachment for the chanting of the holy name, even after hearing all these scriptural injunctions. There is no way to atone for any of these offenses. It is therefore recommended that an offender at the feet of the holy name continue to chant the holy name twenty-four hours a day. Constant chanting of the holy name will make one free of offenses, and then he will gradually be elevated to the transcendental platform on which he can chant the pure holy name and thus become a lover of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is recommended that even if one commits offenses, one should continue chanting the holy name. In other words, the chanting of the holy name makes one offenseless. In the book N\u0101ma-kaumud\u012b it is recommended that if one is an offender at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, he should submit to that Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and be excused; similarly, if one is an offender in chanting the holy name, he should submit to the holy name and thus be freed from his offenses. In this connection there is the following statement, spoken by Dak\u1e63a to Lord \u015aiva: \u201cI did not know the glories of your personality, and therefore I committed an offense at your lotus feet in the open assembly. You are so kind, however, that you did not accept my offense. Instead, when I was falling down because of accusing you, you saved me by your merciful glance. You are most great. Kindly excuse me and be satisfied with your own exalted qualities.\u201d One should be very humble and meek to offer one\u2019s desires and chant prayers composed in glorification of the holy name, such as ayi mukta-kulair up\u0101sya m\u0101nam and niv\u1e5btta-tar\u1e63air upag\u012byam\u0101n\u0101d. One should chant such prayers to become free from offenses at the lotus feet of the holy name. (3) Smara\u1e47am. After one regularly performs the processes of hearing and chanting and after the core of one\u2019s heart is cleansed, smara\u1e47am, remembering, is recommended. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.1.11) \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b tells King Par\u012bk\u1e63it: \u201cO King, for great yog\u012bs who have completely renounced all material connections, for those who desire all material enjoyment and for those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord is recommended.\u201d According to different relationships with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are varieties of n\u0101m\u0101nuk\u012brtanam, chanting of the holy name, and thus according to different relationships and mellows there are five kinds of remembering. These are as follows: (a) conducting research into the worship of a particular form of the Lord, (b) concentrating the mind on one subject and withdrawing the mind\u2019s activities of thinking, feeling and willing from all other subjects, (c) concentrating upon a particular form of the Lord (this is called meditation), (d) concentrating one\u2019s mind continuously on the form of the Lord (this is called dhruv\u0101nusm\u1e5bti, or perfect meditation), and (e) awakening a likening for concentration upon a particular form (this is called sam\u0101dhi, or trance). Mental concentration upon particular pastimes of the Lord in particular circumstances is also called remembrance. Therefore sam\u0101dhi, trance, can be possible in five different ways in terms of one\u2019s relationship. Specifically, the trance of devotees on the stage of neutrality is called mental concentration. (4) P\u0101da-sevanam. According to one\u2019s taste and strength, hearing, chanting and remembrance may be followed by p\u0101da-sevanam. One obtains the perfection of remembering when one constantly thinks of the lotus feet of the Lord. Being intensely attached to thinking of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet is called p\u0101da-sevanam. When one is particularly adherent to the process of p\u0101da-sevanam, this process gradually includes other processes, such as seeing the form of the Lord, touching the form of the Lord, circumambulating the form or temple of the Lord, visiting such places as Jagann\u0101tha Pur\u012b, Dv\u0101rak\u0101 and Mathur\u0101 to see the Lord\u2019s form, and bathing in the Ganges or Yamun\u0101. Bathing in the Ganges and serving a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava are also known as tad\u012bya-up\u0101sanam. This is also p\u0101da-sevanam. The word tad\u012bya means \u201cin relationship with the Lord.\u201d Service to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, Tulas\u012b, Ganges and Yamun\u0101 are included in p\u0101da-sevanam. All these processes of p\u0101da-sevanam help one advance in spiritual life very quickly. (5) Arcanam. After p\u0101da-sevanam comes the process of arcanam, worship of the Deity. If one is interested in the process of arcanam, one must positively take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and learn the process from him. There are many books for arcana, especially N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra. In this age, the Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra system is particularly recommended for arcana, Deity worship. There are two systems of arcana \u2014 the bh\u0101gavata system and p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b system. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam there is no recommendation of p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b worship because in this Kali-yuga, even without Deity worship, everything can be perfectly performed simply through hearing, chanting, remembering and worship of the lotus feet of the Lord. R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b states: \u201cPar\u012bk\u1e63it Mah\u0101r\u0101ja attained salvation simply by hearing, and \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b attained salvation simply by chanting. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja attained salvation by remembering the Lord. The goddess of fortune, Lak\u1e63m\u012bdev\u012b, attained perfection by worshiping the Lord\u2019s lotus feet. P\u1e5bthu Mah\u0101r\u0101ja attained salvation by worshiping the Deity of the Lord. Akr\u016bra attained salvation by offering prayers, Hanum\u0101n by rendering service, Arjuna by establishing friendship with the Lord, and Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja by offering everything to the service of the Lord.\u201d All these great devotees served the Lord according to a particular process, but every one of them attained salvation and became eligible to return home, back to Godhead. This is explained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. It is therefore recommended that initiated devotees follow the principles of N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra by worshiping the Deity in the temple. Especially for householder devotees who are opulent in material possessions, the path of Deity worship is strongly recommended. An opulent householder devotee who does not engage his hard-earned money in the service of the Lord is called a miser. One should not engage paid br\u0101hma\u1e47as to worship the Deity. If one does not personally worship the Deity but engages paid servants instead, he is considered lazy, and his worship of the Deity is called artificial. An opulent householder can collect luxurious paraphernalia for Deity worship, and consequently for householder devotees the worship of the Deity is compulsory. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement there are brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, g\u1e5bhasthas, v\u0101naprasthas and sanny\u0101s\u012bs, but the Deity worship in the temple should be performed especially by the householders. The brahmac\u0101r\u012bs can go with the sanny\u0101s\u012bs to preach, and the v\u0101naprasthas should prepare themselves for the next status of renounced life, sanny\u0101sa. G\u1e5bhastha devotees, however, are generally engaged in material activities, and therefore if they do not take to Deity worship, their falling down is positively assured. Deity worship means following the rules and regulations precisely. That will keep one steady in devotional service. Generally householders have children, and then the wives of the householders should be engaged in caring for the children, just as women acting as teachers care for the children in a nursery school. G\u1e5bhastha devotees must adopt the arcana-vidhi, or Deity worship according to the suitable arrangements and directions given by the spiritual master. Regarding those unable to take to the Deity worship in the temple, there is the following statement in the Agni Pur\u0101\u1e47a. Any householder devotee circumstantially unable to worship the Deity must at least see the Deity worship, and in this way he may achieve success also. The special purpose of Deity worship is to keep oneself always pure and clean. G\u1e5bhastha devotees should be actual examples of cleanliness. Deity worship should be continued along with hearing and chanting. Therefore every mantra is preceded by the word nama\u1e25. In all the mantras there are specific potencies, of which the g\u1e5bhastha devotees must take advantage. There are many mantras preceded by the word nama\u1e25, but if one chants the holy name of the Lord, he receives the result of chanting nama\u1e25 many times. By chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can reach the platform of love of Godhead. One might ask, then what is the necessity of being initiated? The answer is that even though the chanting of the holy name is sufficient to enable one to progress in spiritual life to the standard of love of Godhead, one is nonetheless susceptible to contamination because of possessing a material body. Consequently, special stress is given to the arcana-vidhi. One should therefore regularly take advantage of both the bh\u0101gavata process and p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b process. Deity worship has two divisions, namely pure and mixed with fruitive activities. For one who is steady, Deity worship is compulsory. Observing the various types of festivals, such as \u015ar\u012b Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b, R\u0101ma-navam\u012b and N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha-caturda\u015b\u012b, is also included in the process of Deity worship. In other words, it is compulsory for householder devotees to observe these festivals. Now let us discuss the offenses in Deity worship. The following are offenses: (a) to enter the temple with shoes or being carried on a palanquin, (b) not to observe the prescribed festivals, (c) to avoid offering obeisances in front of the Deity, (d) to offer prayers in an unclean state, not having washed one\u2019s hands after eating, (e) to offer obeisances with one hand, (f) to circumambulate directly in front of the Deity, (g) to spread one\u2019s legs before the Deity, (h) to sit before the Deity while holding one\u2019s ankles with one\u2019s hands, (i) to lie down before the Deity, (j) to eat before the Deity, (k) to speak lies before the Deity, (l) to address someone loudly before the Deity, (m) to talk nonsense before the Deity, (n) to cry before the Deity, (o) to argue before the Deity, (p) to chastise someone before the Deity, (q) to show someone favor before the Deity, (r) to use harsh words before the Deity, (s) to wear a woolen blanket before the Deity, (t) to blaspheme someone before the Deity, (u) to worship someone else before the Deity, (v) to use vulgar language before the Deity, (w) to pass air before the Deity, (x) to avoid very opulent worship of the Deity, even though one is able to perform it, (y) to eat something not offered to the Deity, (z) to avoid offering fresh fruits to the Deity according to the season, (aa) to offer food to the Deity which has already been used or from which has first been given to others (in other words, food should not be distributed to anyone else until it has been offered to the Deity), (bb) to sit with one\u2019s back toward the Deity, (cc) to offer obeisances to someone else in front of the Deity, (dd) not to chant proper prayers when offering obeisances to the spiritual master, (ee) to praise oneself before the Deity, and (ff) to blaspheme the demigods. In the worship of the Deity, these thirty-two offenses should be avoided. In the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a the following offenses are mentioned: (a) to eat in the house of a rich man, (b) to enter the Deity\u2019s room in the dark, (c) to worship the Deity without following the regulative principles, (d) to enter the temple without vibrating any sound, (e) to collect food that has been seen by a dog, (f) to break silence while offering worship to the Deity, (g) to go to the toilet during the time of worshiping the Deity, (h) to offer incense without offering flowers, (i) to worship the Deity with forbidden flowers, (j) to begin worship without having washed one\u2019s teeth, (k) to begin worship after sex, (l) to touch a lamp, dead body or a woman during her menstrual period, or to put on red or bluish clothing, unwashed clothing, the clothing of others or soiled clothing. Other offenses are to worship the Deity after seeing a dead body, to pass air before the Deity, to show anger before the Deity, and to worship the Deity just after returning from a crematorium. After eating, one should not worship the Deity until one has digested his food, nor should one touch the Deity or engage in any Deity worship after eating safflower oil or hing. These are also offenses. In other places, the following offenses are listed: (a) to be against the scriptural injunctions of the Vedic literature or to disrespect within one\u2019s heart the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam while externally falsely accepting its principles, (b) to introduce differing \u015b\u0101stras, (c) to chew pan and betel before the Deity, (d) to keep flowers for worship on the leaf of a castor oil plant, (e) to worship the Deity in the afternoon, (f) to sit on the altar or to sit on the floor to worship the Deity (without a seat), (g) to touch the Deity with the left hand while bathing the Deity, (h) to worship the Deity with a stale or used flower, (i) to spit while worshiping the Deity, (j) to advertise one\u2019s glory while worshiping the Deity, (k) to apply tilaka to one\u2019s forehead in a curved way, (l) to enter the temple without having washed one\u2019s feet, (m) to offer the Deity food cooked by an uninitiated person, (n) to worship the Deity and offer bhoga to the Deity within the vision of an uninitiated person or non-Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, (o) to offer worship to the Deity without worshiping Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha deities like Ga\u1e47e\u015ba, (p) to worship the Deity while perspiring, (q) to refuse flowers offered to the Deity, (r) to take a vow or oath in the holy name of the Lord. If one commits any of the above offenses, one must read at least one chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. This is confirmed in the Skanda-Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Avant\u012b-kha\u1e47\u1e0da. Similarly, there is another injunction, stating that one who reads the thousand names of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can be released from all offenses. In the same Skanda-Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Rev\u0101-kha\u1e47\u1e0da, it is said that one who recites prayers to tulas\u012b or sows a tulas\u012b seed is also freed from all offenses. Similarly, one who worships the \u015b\u0101lagr\u0101ma-\u015bil\u0101 can also be relieved of offenses. In the Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said that one who worships Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, whose four hands bear a conchshell, disc, lotus flower and club, can be relieved from the above offenses. In the \u0100di-var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said that a worshiper who has committed offenses may fast for one day at the holy place known as \u015aaukarava and then bathe in the Ganges. In the process of worshiping the Deity it is sometimes enjoined that one worship the Deity within the mind. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Uttara-kha\u1e47\u1e0da, it is said, \u201cAll persons can generally worship within the mind.\u201d The Gautam\u012bya Tantra states, \u201cFor a sanny\u0101s\u012b who has no home, worship of the Deity within the mind is recommended.\u201d In the N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra it is stated by Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a that worship of the Deity within the mind is called m\u0101nasa-p\u016bj\u0101. One can become free from the four miseries by this method. Sometimes worship from the mind can be independently executed. According to the instruction of \u0100virhotra Muni, one of the nava-yogendras, as mentioned in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, one may worship the Deity by chanting all the mantras. Eight kinds of Deities are mentioned in the \u015b\u0101stra, and the mental Deity is one of them. In this regard, the following description is given in the Brahma-vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47a. In the city of Prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na-pura, long ago, there resided a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who was poverty-stricken but innocent and not dissatisfied. One day he heard a discourse in an assembly of br\u0101hma\u1e47as concerning how to worship the Deity in the temple. In that meeting, he also heard that the Deity may be worshiped within the mind. After this incident, the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, having bathed in the God\u0101var\u012b River, began mentally worshiping the Deity. He would wash the temple within his mind, and then in his imagination he would bring water from all the sacred rivers in golden and silver waterpots. He collected all kinds of valuable paraphernalia for worship, and he worshiped the Deity very gorgeously, beginning from bathing the Deity and ending with offering \u0101rati. Thus he felt great happiness. After many years had passed in this way, one day within his mind he cooked nice sweet rice with ghee to worship the Deity. He placed the sweet rice on a golden dish and offered it to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but he felt that the sweet rice was very hot, and therefore he touched it with his finger. He immediately felt that his finger had been burned by the hot sweet rice, and thus he began to lament. While the br\u0101hma\u1e47a was in pain, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha began smiling, and the goddess of fortune inquired from the Lord why He was smiling. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u then ordered His associates to bring the br\u0101hma\u1e47a to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Thus the br\u0101hma\u1e47a attained the liberation of s\u0101m\u012bpya, the facility of living near the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (6) Vandanam. Although prayers are a part of Deity worship, they may be considered separately like the other items, such as hearing and chanting, and therefore separate statements are given herewith. The Lord has unlimited transcendental qualities and opulences, and one who feels influenced by the Lord\u2019s qualities in various activities offers prayers to the Lord. In this way he becomes successful. In this connection, the following are some of the offenses to be avoided: (a) to offer obeisances on one hand, (b) to offer obeisances with one\u2019s body covered, (c) to show one\u2019s back to the Deity, (d) to offer obeisances on the left side of the Deity, (e) to offer obeisances very near the Deity. (7) D\u0101syam. There is the following statement in regard to assisting the Lord as a servant. After many, many thousands of births, when one comes to understand that he is an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can deliver others from this universe. If one simply continues to think that he is an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even without performing any other process of devotional service, he can attain full success, for simply by this feeling one can perform all nine processes of devotional service. (8) Sakhyam. In regard to worshiping the Lord as a friend, the Agastya-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 states that a devotee engaged in performing devotional service by \u015brava\u1e47am and k\u012brtanam sometimes wants to see the Lord personally, and for this purpose he resides in the temple. Elsewhere there is this statement: \u201cO my Lord, Supreme Personality and eternal friend, although You are full of bliss and knowledge, You have become the friend of the residents of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. How fortunate are these devotees!\u201d In this statement the word \u201cfriend\u201d is specifically used to indicate intense love. Friendship, therefore, is better than servitude. In the stage above d\u0101sya-rasa, the devotee accepts the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a friend. This is not at all astonishing, for when a devotee is pure in heart the opulence of his worship of the Deity diminishes as spontaneous love for the Personality of Godhead is manifested. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b mentions \u015ar\u012bd\u0101ma Vipra, who expressed to himself his feelings of obligation, thinking, \u201cLife after life, may I be connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this friendly attitude.\u201d (9) \u0100tma-nivedanam. The word \u0101tma-nivedanam refers to the stage at which one who has no motive other than to serve the Lord surrenders everything to the Lord and performs his activities only to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee is like a cow that is cared for by its master. When cared for by its master, a cow is not in anxiety over its maintenance. Such a cow is always devoted to its master, and it never acts independently, but only for the master\u2019s benefit. Some devotees, therefore, consider dedication of the body to the Lord to be \u0101tma-nivedanam, and as stated in the book known as Bhakti-viveka, sometimes dedication of the soul to the Lord is called \u0101tma-nivedanam. The best examples of \u0101tma-nivedanam are found in Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Ambar\u012b\u1e63a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. \u0100tma-nivedanam is also sometimes found in the behavior of Rukmi\u1e47\u012bdev\u012b at Dv\u0101rak\u0101."

Their inclinations toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are never aroused, either by the instructions of others, by their own efforts, or by a combination of both.",
        "purport": " In this verse the words matir na k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e refer to devotional service rendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So-called politicians, erudite scholars and philosophers who read Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 try to twist some meaning from it to suit their material purposes, but their misunderstandings of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will not yield them any profit. Because such politicians, philosophers and scholars are interested in using Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as a vehicle for adjusting things materially, for them constant thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is impossible (matir na k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e). As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55), bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti: only through devotional service can one understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is. The so-called politicians and scholars think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as fictitious. The politician says that his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is different from the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a depicted in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Even though he accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and R\u0101ma as the Supreme he thinks of R\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as impersonal because he has no idea of service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus his only business is puna\u1e25 puna\u015b carvita-carva\u1e47\u0101n\u0101m \u2014 chewing the chewed again and again. The aim of such politicians and academic scholars is to enjoy this material world with their bodily senses. Therefore it is clearly stated here that those who are g\u1e5bha-vrata, whose only aim is to live comfortably with the body in the material world, cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The two expressions g\u1e5bha-vrata and carvita-carva\u1e47\u0101n\u0101m indicate that a materialistic person tries to enjoy sense gratification in different bodily forms, life after life, but is still unsatisfied. In the name of personalism, this ism or that ism, such persons always remain attached to the materialistic way of life. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.44): \u201cIn the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place.\u201d Those who are attached to material enjoyment cannot be fixed in devotional service to the Lord. They cannot understand Bhagav\u0101n, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His instruction, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Ad\u0101nta-gobhir vi\u015bat\u0101\u1e41 tamisram: their path actually leads toward hellish life. As confirmed by \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, mahat-sev\u0101\u1e41 dv\u0101ram \u0101hur vimukte\u1e25: one must try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by serving a devotee. The word mahat refers to a devotee. \u201cO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.\u201d (Bg. 9.13) A mah\u0101tm\u0101 is one who is constantly engaged in devotional service, twenty-four hours a day. As explained in the following verses, unless one adheres to such a great personality, one cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu wanted to know where Prahl\u0101da had gotten this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Who had taught him? Prahl\u0101da sarcastically replied, \u201cMy dear father, persons like you never understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only by serving a mahat, a great soul. Those who try to adjust material conditions are said to be chewing the chewed. No one has been able to adjust material conditions, but life after life, generation after generation, people try and repeatedly fail. Unless one is properly trained by a mahat \u2014 a mah\u0101tm\u0101, or unalloyed devotee of the Lord \u2014 there is no possibility of one\u2019s understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotional service.\u201d"

        "purport": " Since there must always be a difference of opinion between demons and devotees, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, when criticized by his son Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, should not have been surprised that Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja differed from his way of life. Nonetheless, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was extremely angry and wanted to rebuke his son for deriding his teacher or spiritual master, who had been born in the br\u0101hma\u1e47a family of the great \u0101c\u0101rya \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya. The word \u015bukra means \u201csemen,\u201d and \u0101c\u0101rya refers to a teacher or guru. Hereditary gurus, or spiritual masters, have been accepted everywhere since time immemorial, but Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja declined to accept such a seminal guru or take instruction from him. An actual guru is \u015brotriya, one who has heard or received perfect knowledge through parampar\u0101, the disciplic succession. Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not recognize a seminal spiritual master. Such spiritual masters are not at all interested in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Indeed, they are hopeful of material success (bahir-artha-m\u0101nina\u1e25). The word bahi\u1e25 means \u201cexternal,\u201d artha means \u201cinterest,\u201d and m\u0101nina means \u201ctaking very seriously.\u201d Generally speaking, practically everyone is unaware of the spiritual world. The knowledge of the materialists is restricted within the four-billion-mile limit of this material world, which is in the dark portion of the creation; they do not know that beyond the material world is the spiritual world. Unless one is a devotee of the Lord, one cannot understand the existence of the spiritual world. Gurus, teachers, who are simply interested in this material world are described in this verse as andha, blind. Such blind men may lead many other blind followers without true knowledge of material conditions, but they are not accepted by devotees like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Such blind teachers, being interested in the external, material world, are always bound by the strong ropes of material nature."

        "translation": "Unless they smear upon their bodies the dust of the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava completely freed from material contamination, persons very much inclined toward materialistic life cannot be attached to the lotus feet of the Lord, who is glorified for His uncommon activities. Only by becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and taking shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord in this way can one be freed from material contamination.",
        "purport": " Becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious brings about anartha-apagama\u1e25, the disappearance of all anarthas, the miserable conditions we have unnecessarily accepted. The material body is the basic principle of these unwanted miserable conditions. The entire Vedic civilization is meant to relieve one from these unwanted miseries, but persons bound by the laws of nature do not know the destination of life. As described in the previous verse, \u012b\u015ba-tantry\u0101m uru-d\u0101mni baddh\u0101\u1e25: they are conditioned by the three strong modes of material nature. The education that keeps the conditioned soul bound life after life is called materialistic education. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has explained that materialistic education expands the influence of m\u0101y\u0101. Such an education induces the conditioned soul to be increasingly attracted to materialistic life and to stray further and further away from liberation from unwanted miseries. One may ask why highly educated persons do not take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The reason is explained in this verse. Unless one takes shelter of a bona fide, fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious spiritual master, there is no chance of understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The educators, scholars and big political leaders worshiped by millions of people cannot understand the goal of life and take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for they have not accepted a bona fide spiritual master and the Vedas. Therefore in the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (3.2.3) it is said, n\u0101yam \u0101tm\u0101 pravacanena labhyo na medhay\u0101 na bahun\u0101 \u015brutena: one cannot become self-realized simply by having an academic education, by presenting lectures in an erudite way (pravacanena labhya\u1e25), or by being an intelligent scientist who discovers many wonderful things. One cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a unless one is graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Only one who has surrendered to a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and taken the dust of his lotus feet can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. First one must understand how to get out of the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. The only means is to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. And to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious very easily, one must take shelter of a realized soul \u2014 a mahat, or mah\u0101tm\u0101 \u2014 whose only interest is to engage in the service of the Supreme Lord. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.13): \u201cO son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.\u201d Therefore, to end the unwanted miseries of life, one must become a devotee. \u201cOne who has unflinching devotional faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consistently manifests all the good qualities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the demigods.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.18.12) \u201cOnly unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23) \u201cThe Lord is obtained only by one whom He Himself chooses. To such a person He manifests His own form.\u201d (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 3.2.3) These are Vedic injunctions. One must take shelter of a self-realized spiritual master, not a materially educated scholar or politician. One must take shelter of a ni\u1e63ki\u00f1cana, a person engaged in devotional service and free from material contamination. That is the way to return home, back to Godhead."

Similarly, if someone outside one\u2019s family is favorable, he should be given protection like a son. On the other hand, if a limb of one\u2019s body is poisoned by disease, it must be amputated so that the rest of the body may live happily.

        "purport": " \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has instructed all devotees of the Lord to be humbler than the grass and more tolerant than trees; otherwise there will always be disturbances to their execution of devotional service. Here is a vivid example of how a devotee is disturbed by a nondevotee, even though the nondevotee is an affectionate father. The material world is such that a nondevotee father becomes an enemy of a devotee son. Having determined to kill even his son, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu gave the example of amputating a part of one\u2019s body that has become septic and therefore injurious to the rest of the body. The same example, of course, may also be applied to nondevotees. C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita advises, tyaja durjana-sa\u1e41sarga\u1e41 bhaja s\u0101dhu-sam\u0101gamam. Devotees actually serious about advancing in spiritual life should give up the company of nondevotees and always keep company with devotees. To be too attached to material existence is ignorance because material existence is temporary and miserable. Therefore devotees who are determined to perform tapasya (penances and austerities) to realize the self, and who are determined to become advanced in spiritual consciousness, must give up the company of atheistic nondevotees. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja maintained an attitude of noncooperation with the philosophy of his father, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, yet he was tolerant and humble. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, however, being a nondevotee, was so polluted that he was even prepared to kill his own son. He justified this by putting forward the logic of amputation."

There have been many attempts by the demons to hurt or kill the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He cannot be injured by any material means because He is always in transcendence. Therefore the words pare brahma\u1e47i are used here. The demons, the R\u0101k\u1e63asas, can neither see nor touch the Supreme Lord, although they may superficially think that they are striking the Lord\u2019s transcendental body with their material weapons. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described in this verse as anirde\u015bye. We cannot understand Him to be in a particular place, for He is all-pervasive. Moreover, He is akhil\u0101tm\u0101, the active principle of everything, even material weapons. Those who cannot understand the position of the Lord are unfortunate.

        "purport": " Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu wanted Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to be trained as a diplomatic king in ruling the kingdom, the country or the world, but not to be advised about renunciation or the renounced order of life. The word dharma here does not refer to some religious faith. As clearly stated, dharmo hy asyopade\u1e63\u1e6davyo r\u0101j\u00f1\u0101\u1e41 yo g\u1e5bha-medhin\u0101m. There are two kinds of royal families \u2014 one whose members are simply attached to household life and the other consisting of r\u0101jar\u1e63is, kings who govern with ruling power but are as good as great saints. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja wanted to become a r\u0101jar\u1e63i, whereas Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu wanted him to become a king attached to sense enjoyment (g\u1e5bha-medhin\u0101m). Therefore in the \u0100ryan system there is var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, by which everyone should be educated according to his position in society\u2019s division of var\u1e47a (br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra) and \u0101\u015brama (brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa). A devotee purified by devotional service is always in the transcendental position above the mundane qualities. Thus the difference between Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was that Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu wanted to keep Prahl\u0101da in mundane attachment whereas Prahl\u0101da was above the modes of material nature. As long as one is under the control of material nature, his occupational duty is different from that of a person not under such control. One\u2019s real dharma, or occupational duty, is described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam). As described to his order carriers by Dharmar\u0101ja, or Yamar\u0101ja, a living being is a spiritual identity, and therefore his occupational duty is also spiritual. The real dharma is that which is advised in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. One must give up one\u2019s material occupational duties, just as one must give up his material body. Whatever one\u2019s occupational duty, even according to the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, one must give it up and engage in one\u2019s spiritual function. One\u2019s real dharma, or occupational duty, is explained by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. J\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa\u2019: every living being is an eternal servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is one\u2019s real occupational duty."

        "purport": " Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s smiling is very significant. The other students were very much advanced in enjoying materialistic life through religion, economic development and sense gratification, but Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja laughed at them, knowing that this was not actual happiness, for real happiness is advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The duty of those who follow in the footsteps of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is to teach the entire world how to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and thus be really happy. Materialistic persons take to so-called religion to get some blessings so that they can improve their economic position and enjoy the material world through sense gratification. But devotees like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja laugh at how foolish they are to be busy in a temporary life without knowledge of the soul\u2019s transmigration from one body to another. Materialistic persons are engaged in striving for temporary benefits, whereas persons advanced in spiritual knowledge, such as Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, are not interested in the materialistic way of life. Instead, they want to be elevated to an eternal life of knowledge and bliss. Therefore, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always compassionate to the fallen souls, His servants, the devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are also interested in educating the entire populace in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The mistake of materialistic life is understood by devotees, and therefore they smile upon it, considering it insignificant. Out of compassion, however, such devotees preach the gospel of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 all over the world."

Thus the boys surrounded Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, giving up their playthings, and sat down to hear him. Their hearts and eyes being fixed upon him, they looked at him with great earnestness. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, although born in a demon family, was an exalted devotee, and he desired their welfare. Thus he began instructing them about the futility of materialistic life.",
        "purport": " The words b\u0101l\u0101 ad\u016b\u1e63ita-dhiya\u1e25 indicate that the children, being of a tender age, were not as polluted by materialistic life as their fathers. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, therefore, taking advantage of the innocence of his class friends, began teaching them about the importance of spiritual life and the insignificance of materialistic life. Although the teachers \u1e62a\u1e47\u1e0da and Amarka were instructing all the boys in the materialistic life of religion, economic development and sense gratification, the boys were not much polluted. Therefore, with great attention they wanted to hear from Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, the gurukula plays an extremely important part in our activities because right from childhood the boys at the gurukula are instructed about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Thus they become steady within the cores of their hearts, and there is very little possibility that they will be conquered by the modes of material nature when they are older."
