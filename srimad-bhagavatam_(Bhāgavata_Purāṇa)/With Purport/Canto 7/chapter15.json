M\u0101dhavendra Pur\u012b, for instance, would never go to anyone to ask for food. \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has also said, kasm\u0101d bhajanti kavayo dhana-durmad\u0101ndh\u0101n. Why should one approach a person who is blind with wealth? Rather, one should depend on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He will give everything. All the members of our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, whether they be g\u1e5bhasthas or sanny\u0101s\u012bs, should try to spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement with determination, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will supply all necessities. The process of \u0101jagara-v\u1e5btti, the means of livelihood of a python, is very much appreciated in this regard. Even though one may be very poor, he should simply try to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and not endeavor to earn his livelihood."

        "purport": " For spiritual advancement, one should be materially satisfied, for if one is not materially satisfied, his greed for material development will result in the frustration of his spiritual advancement. There are two things that nullify all good qualities. One is poverty. Daridra-do\u1e63o gu\u1e47a-r\u0101\u015bi-n\u0101\u015b\u012b. If one is poverty-stricken, all his good qualities become null and void. Similarly, if one becomes too greedy, his good qualifications are lost. Therefore the adjustment is that one should not be poverty-stricken, but one must try to be fully satisfied with the bare necessities of life and not be greedy. For a devotee to be satisfied with the bare necessities is therefore the best advice for spiritual advancement. Learned authorities in devotional life consequently advise that one not endeavor to increase the number of temples and ma\u1e6dhas. Such activities can be undertaken only by devotees experienced in propagating the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. All the \u0101c\u0101ryas in South India, especially \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, constructed many big temples, and in North India all the Gosv\u0101m\u012bs of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana constructed large temples. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura also constructed large centers, known as Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Ma\u1e6dhas. Therefore temple construction is not bad, provided proper care is taken for the propagation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Even if such endeavors are considered greedy, the greed is to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore these are spiritual activities."

However, if one is determined not to live with a woman, even while seeing a woman he will not become lusty. If one is determined not to have sex, he can automatically conquer lusty desires. The example given in this regard is that even if one is hungry, if on a particular day he is determined to observe fasting, he can naturally conquer the disturbances of hunger and thirst. If one is determined not to be envious of anyone, he can naturally conquer anger. Similarly, one can give up the desire to accumulate wealth simply by considering how difficult it is to protect the money in one\u2019s possession. If one keeps a large amount of cash with him, he is always anxious about keeping it properly. Thus if one discusses the disadvantages of accumulating wealth, he can naturally give up business without difficulty."

His lotus feet are sought and worshiped by great saintly persons like Vy\u0101sa. Nonetheless, there are fools who consider Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a an ordinary human being.",
        "purport": " The example of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s being the Supreme Personality of Godhead is appropriate in regard to understanding the spiritual master. The spiritual master is called sevaka-bhagav\u0101n, the servitor Personality of Godhead, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called sevya-bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is to be worshiped. The spiritual master is the worshiper God, whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the worshipable God. This is the difference between the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Another point: Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which constitutes the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is presented by the spiritual master as it is, without deviation. Therefore the Absolute Truth is present in the spiritual master. As clearly stated in text 26, j\u00f1\u0101na-d\u012bpa-prade. The Supreme Personality of Godhead gives real knowledge to the entire world, and the spiritual master, as the representative of the Supreme Godhead, carries the message throughout the world. Therefore, on the absolute platform, there is no difference between the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If someone considers the Supreme Personality \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Lord R\u0101macandra \u2014 to be an ordinary human being, this does not mean that the Lord becomes an ordinary human being. Similarly, if the family members of the spiritual master, who is the bona fide representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, consider the spiritual master an ordinary human being, this does not mean that he becomes an ordinary human being. The spiritual master is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore one who is very serious about spiritual advancement must regard the spiritual master in this way. Even a slight deviation from this understanding can create disaster in the disciple\u2019s Vedic studies and austerities."

The difference between chanting o\u1e41k\u0101ra and chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra is that the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra may be chanted without consideration of the place or the sitting arrangements recommended in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.11): \u201cTo practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay ku\u015ba grass on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth. The seat should neither be too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place.\u201d The Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra may be chanted by anyone, without consideration of the place or how one sits. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has openly declared, niyamita\u1e25 smara\u1e47e na k\u0101la\u1e25. In chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra there are no particular injunctions regarding one\u2019s sitting place. The injunction niyamita\u1e25 smara\u1e47e na k\u0101la\u1e25 includes de\u015ba, k\u0101la and p\u0101tra \u2014 place, time and the individual. Therefore anyone may chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, without consideration of the time and place. Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is very difficult to find a suitable place according to the recommendations of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra, however, may be chanted at any place and any time, and this will bring results very quickly. Yet even while chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra one may observe regulative principles. Thus while sitting and chanting one may keep his body straight, and this will help one in the chanting process; otherwise one may feel sleepy."

        "purport": " A sanny\u0101s\u012b is one who has clearly understood, through advancement in knowledge, that Brahman \u2014 he, the person himself \u2014 is the soul, not the body. One who has this understanding may take sanny\u0101sa, for he is situated in the \u201caha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi\u201d position. Brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 prasann\u0101tm\u0101 na \u015bocati na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ati. Such a person, who no longer laments or hankers to maintain his body and who can accept all living entities as spirit souls, can then enter the devotional service of the Lord. If one does not enter the devotional service of the Lord but artificially considers himself Brahman or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, not perfectly understanding that the soul and body are different, one certainly falls down (patanty adha\u1e25). Such a person again gives importance to the body. There are many sanny\u0101s\u012bs in India who stress the importance of the body. Some of them give special importance to the body of the poor man, accepting him as daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, as if N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a had a material body. Many other sanny\u0101s\u012bs stress the importance of the social position of the body as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra. Such sanny\u0101s\u012bs are considered the greatest rascals (asattam\u0101\u1e25). They are shameless because they have not yet understood the difference between the body and the soul and instead have accepted the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Brahmanism (br\u0101hma\u1e47ya) consists of the knowledge of Brahman. But actually the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is not Brahman. Similarly, the body is neither rich nor poor. If the body of a poor man were daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, this would mean that the body of a rich man, on the contrary, must be dhan\u012b-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Therefore sanny\u0101s\u012bs who do not know the meaning of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, those who regard the body as Brahman or as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, are described here as asattam\u0101\u1e25, the most abominable rascals. Following the bodily concept of life, such sanny\u0101s\u012bs make various programs to serve the body. They conduct farcical missions consisting of so-called religious activities meant to mislead all of human society. These sanny\u0101s\u012bs have been described herein as apatrapa\u1e25 and asattam\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 shameless and fallen from spiritual life."

        "purport": " Of course, everyone in this material world is interested in maintaining the body for sense gratification, but by cultivating knowledge one should gradually understand that the body is not the self. Both the soul and the Supersoul are transcendental to the material world. This is to be understood in the human form of life, especially when one takes sanny\u0101sa. A sanny\u0101s\u012b, one who has understood the self, should be engaged in elevating the self and associating with the Superself. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is meant for elevating the living being for promotion back home, back to Godhead. Seeking such elevation is one\u2019s duty in the human form of life. Unless one performs this duty, why should one maintain the body? Especially if a sanny\u0101s\u012b not only maintains the body by ordinary means but does everything to maintain the body, including even eating meat and other abominable things, he must be a lampa\u1e6da\u1e25, a greedy person simply engaged in sense gratification. A sanny\u0101s\u012b must specifically remove himself from the urges of the tongue, belly and genitals, which disturb one as long as one is not fully aware that the body is separate from the soul."

The advice of experienced transcendentalists, therefore, is that the body be fully engaged for achieving the ultimate goal of life (sv\u0101rtha-gatim). The real interest or goal of life is to return home, back to Godhead. To enable one to fulfill this purpose, there are so many Vedic literatures, including Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, the Upani\u1e63ads, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. One should take lessons from these Vedic literatures and learn how to practice niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga. Then one\u2019s life will be perfect. The body is important as long as it has consciousness. Without consciousness, the body is merely a lump of matter. Therefore, to return home, back to Godhead, one must change his consciousness from material consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One\u2019s consciousness is the cause of material bondage, but if this consciousness is purified by bhakti-yoga, one can then understand the falsity of his up\u0101dhi, his designations as Indian, American, Hindu, Muslim, Christian and so on. Sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41 tat-paratvena nirmalam. One must forget these designations and use this consciousness only for the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore if one takes advantage of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, his life is certainly successful."

The living entity in the bodily concept of life is the owner of the chariot. The Vedic mantra pra\u1e47ava is the bow, the pure living entity himself is the arrow, and the target is the Supreme Being.",
        "purport": " Ten kinds of life air always flow within the material body. They are called pr\u0101\u1e47a, ap\u0101na, sam\u0101na, vy\u0101na, ud\u0101na, n\u0101ga, k\u016brma, k\u1e5bkala, devadatta and dhana\u00f1jaya. They are compared here to the spokes of the chariot\u2019s wheels. The life air is the energy for all of a living being\u2019s activities, which are sometimes religious and sometimes irreligious. Thus religion and irreligion are said to be the upper and lower portions of the chariot\u2019s wheels. When the living entity decides to go back home, back to Godhead, his target is Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the conditioned state of life, one does not understand that the goal of life is the Supreme Lord. Na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e41 dur\u0101\u015bay\u0101 ye bahir-artha-m\u0101nina\u1e25. The living entity tries to be happy within this material world, not understanding the target of his life. When he is purified, however, he gives up his bodily conception of life and his false identity as belonging to a certain community, a certain nation, a certain society, a certain family and so on (sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41 tat-paratvena nirmalam). Then he takes the arrow of his purified life, and with the help of the bow \u2014 the transcendental chanting of pra\u1e47ava, or the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra \u2014 he throws himself toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has commented that because the words \u201cbow\u201d and \u201carrow\u201d are used in this verse, one might argue that the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity have become enemies. However, although the Supreme Personality of Godhead may become the so-called enemy of the living being, this is His chivalrous pleasure. For example, the Lord fought with Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, and when Bh\u012b\u1e63ma pierced the Lord\u2019s body on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, this was a kind of humor or relationship, of which there are twelve. When the conditioned soul tries to reach the Lord by hurling an arrow at Him, the Lord takes pleasure, and the living entity gains the profit of going back home, back to Godhead. Another example given in this regard is that Arjuna, as a result of piercing the \u0101dh\u0101ra-m\u012bna, or the fish within the cakra, achieved the valuable gain of Draupad\u012b. Similarly, if with the arrow of chanting the holy name of the Lord one pierces Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s lotus feet, by dint of performing this heroic activity of devotional service one receives the benefit of returning home, back to Godhead."

The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his disciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore says, guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja: one must first please the spiritual master, and then one automatically pleases K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience. If one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong enough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the enemy, and one also gets the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Simply getting the weapon of j\u00f1\u0101na is insufficient. One must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. Then the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, and after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as long as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, namely going back home, back to Godhead. The perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bh\u016bta). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): \u201cOne who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\u201d Simply by cultivating knowledge as the impersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. One must attain the platform of bhakti."

If one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong enough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the enemy, and one also gets the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Simply getting the weapon of j\u00f1\u0101na is insufficient. One must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. Then the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, and after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as long as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, namely going back home, back to Godhead. The perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bh\u016bta). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): \u201cOne who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\u201d Simply by cultivating knowledge as the impersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. One must attain the platform of bhakti. \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the spiritual master and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a material body. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stresses in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d The word tattvata\u1e25, meaning \u201cin reality,\u201d is very important. Tato m\u0101\u1e41 tattvato j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101. Unless one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his material body. As it is said, \u0101ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25 patanty adho\u00a0\u2019n\u0101d\u1e5bta-yu\u1e63mad-a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25: if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot become free from the material clutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in Brahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the danger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of bhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material world. In summary, as stated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide spiritual master coming in the parampar\u0101 of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for by his mercy and instructions one is able to get strength from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus one engages in devotional service and attains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u."

It is said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.20.17): This human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-kar\u1e47adh\u0101ram, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since the spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his mercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.

One must be very careful in regard to the danger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of bhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material world. In summary, as stated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide spiritual master coming in the parampar\u0101 of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for by his mercy and instructions one is able to get strength from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus one engages in devotional service and attains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Significant in this verse are the words j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101sim acyuta-bala\u1e25. J\u00f1\u0101n\u0101sim, the sword of knowledge, is given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when one serves the guru and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in order to hold the sword of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions, Balar\u0101ma gives one strength. Balar\u0101ma is Nity\u0101nanda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, \u015bac\u012b-suta haila sei, balar\u0101ma ha-ila nit\u0101i. This bala \u2014 Balar\u0101ma \u2014 comes with \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age. P\u0101p\u012b t\u0101p\u012b yata chila, hari-n\u0101me uddh\u0101rila. Their weapon is sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, hari-n\u0101ma. Thus one should accept the sword of knowledge from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be strong with the mercy of Balar\u0101ma. We are therefore worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-Balar\u0101ma in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (3.2.4) it is said:"

In summary, as stated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide spiritual master coming in the parampar\u0101 of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for by his mercy and instructions one is able to get strength from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus one engages in devotional service and attains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Significant in this verse are the words j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101sim acyuta-bala\u1e25. J\u00f1\u0101n\u0101sim, the sword of knowledge, is given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when one serves the guru and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in order to hold the sword of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions, Balar\u0101ma gives one strength. Balar\u0101ma is Nity\u0101nanda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, \u015bac\u012b-suta haila sei, balar\u0101ma ha-ila nit\u0101i. This bala \u2014 Balar\u0101ma \u2014 comes with \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age. P\u0101p\u012b t\u0101p\u012b yata chila, hari-n\u0101me uddh\u0101rila. Their weapon is sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, hari-n\u0101ma. Thus one should accept the sword of knowledge from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be strong with the mercy of Balar\u0101ma. We are therefore worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-Balar\u0101ma in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (3.2.4) it is said: One cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balar\u0101ma. \u015ar\u012b Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore says, nit\u0101iyera karu\u1e47\u0101 habe, vraje r\u0101dh\u0101-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a p\u0101be: when one receives the mercy of Balar\u0101ma, Nity\u0101nanda, one can attain the lotus feet of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very easily."

        "translation": "As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are not fully under one\u2019s control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual master and the spiritual master\u2019s predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of knowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s mercy one must then conquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his own transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9) the Lord says: \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose. It is said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.20.17): This human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-kar\u1e47adh\u0101ram, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since the spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his mercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord. A significant word here is acyuta-bala\u1e25. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his disciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore says, guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja: one must first please the spiritual master, and then one automatically pleases K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience. If one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong enough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the enemy, and one also gets the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Simply getting the weapon of j\u00f1\u0101na is insufficient. One must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. Then the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, and after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as long as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, namely going back home, back to Godhead. The perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bh\u016bta). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.54): \u201cOne who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\u201d Simply by cultivating knowledge as the impersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. One must attain the platform of bhakti. \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the spiritual master and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a material body. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stresses in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9): \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d The word tattvata\u1e25, meaning \u201cin reality,\u201d is very important. Tato m\u0101\u1e41 tattvato j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101. Unless one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his material body. As it is said, \u0101ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25 patanty adho\u00a0\u2019n\u0101d\u1e5bta-yu\u1e63mad-a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25: if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot become free from the material clutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in Brahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the danger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of bhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material world. In summary, as stated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide spiritual master coming in the parampar\u0101 of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for by his mercy and instructions one is able to get strength from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus one engages in devotional service and attains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Significant in this verse are the words j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101sim acyuta-bala\u1e25. J\u00f1\u0101n\u0101sim, the sword of knowledge, is given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when one serves the guru and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in order to hold the sword of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions, Balar\u0101ma gives one strength. Balar\u0101ma is Nity\u0101nanda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, \u015bac\u012b-suta haila sei, balar\u0101ma ha-ila nit\u0101i. This bala \u2014 Balar\u0101ma \u2014 comes with \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age. P\u0101p\u012b t\u0101p\u012b yata chila, hari-n\u0101me uddh\u0101rila. Their weapon is sa\u1e45k\u012brtana, hari-n\u0101ma. Thus one should accept the sword of knowledge from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be strong with the mercy of Balar\u0101ma. We are therefore worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-Balar\u0101ma in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (3.2.4) it is said: One cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balar\u0101ma. \u015ar\u012b Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura therefore says, nit\u0101iyera karu\u1e47\u0101 habe, vraje r\u0101dh\u0101-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a p\u0101be: when one receives the mercy of Balar\u0101ma, Nity\u0101nanda, one can attain the lotus feet of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very easily. If one has no connection with Nit\u0101i, Balar\u0101ma, then even though one is a very learned scholar or j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must therefore conquer the enemies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with the strength received from Balar\u0101ma."

They have arisen simultaneously on the horizon of Gau\u1e0da to dissipate the darkness of ignorance and thus wonderfully bestow benediction upon all.\u201d This material world is a dark well of ignorance. The fallen soul in this dark well must take shelter of the lotus feet of Gaura-Nit\u0101i, for thus he can easily emerge from material existence. Without Their strength, simply attempting to get out of the clutches of matter by speculative knowledge will be insufficient."

Then, like Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, he will refuse to accept any material benediction from the Lord (sv\u0101min k\u1e5bt\u0101rtho\u00a0\u2019smi vara\u1e41 na y\u0101ce).

Even if one goes to the higher planetary systems (y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n), one\u2019s place there is not secure; one must return to martya-loka. \u0100brahma-bhuvan\u0101l lok\u0101\u1e25 punar \u0101vartino\u00a0\u2019rjuna: aside from the moon, even if one goes to Brahmaloka, one must return.

Everything is an emanation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but it is not that everything must therefore be worshiped. Speculative knowledge cannot give us reality as it is, but will continue to be nefariously imperfect. So-called scientists try to prove that there is no God and that everything is happening because of the laws of nature, but this is imperfect knowledge because nothing can work unless directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Therefore a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava insists on the platform of somehow or other accepting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (tasm\u0101t ken\u0101py up\u0101yena mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e nive\u015bayet). When we raise our unmixed faith to the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, everything is revealed. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.1): \u201cNow hear, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101 [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.\u201d Simply by raising one\u2019s staunch faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His instructions, one can understand reality without a doubt (asa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e41 samagra\u1e41 m\u0101m). One can understand how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s material and spiritual energies are working and how He is present everywhere although everything is not Him. This philosophy of acintya-bhed\u0101bheda, inconceivable oneness and difference, is the perfect philosophy enunciated by the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Everything is an emanation from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but it is not that everything must therefore be worshiped. Speculative knowledge cannot give us reality as it is, but will continue to be nefariously imperfect. So-called scientists try to prove that there is no God and that everything is happening because of the laws of nature, but this is imperfect knowledge because nothing can work unless directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.10) by the Lord Himself: \u201cThis material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt\u012b, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.\u201d In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya gives this note: durgha\u1e6datv\u0101d arthatvena parame\u015bvare\u1e47aiva kalpitam. The background of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva. V\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25. This can be understood by a mah\u0101tm\u0101 who is perfect in knowledge. Such a mah\u0101tm\u0101 is rarely seen."

By serving the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, you conquered great enemies, who were like elephants, and thus you collected ingredients for sacrifice.

N\u0101rada Muni encouraged Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira by saying, \u201cYou are already on the safe side because you, along with your entire family, have become a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grace, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas conquered in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra and were saved from many dangers posed not only by kings but sometimes even by the demigods.

Everyone should follow the example of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who showed how to be saved by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is intended to teach how everyone can live peacefully in this material world and at the end of life return home, back to Godhead. In the material world there are always dangers at every step (pada\u1e41 pada\u1e41 yad vipad\u0101\u1e41 na te\u1e63\u0101m). Nonetheless, if one takes shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without hesitation and keeps under the shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can easily cross the ocean of nescience. Sam\u0101\u015brit\u0101 ye pada-pallava-plava\u1e41 mahat-pada\u1e41 pu\u1e47ya-ya\u015bo mur\u0101re\u1e25. To the devotee, this great ocean of nescience becomes like a puddle of water in the hoofprint of a cow. A pure devotee, without embarrassing himself by trying for elevation in so many ways, stays in the safest position as a servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus his life is eternally safe without a doubt."

Upabarha\u1e47a was N\u0101rada Muni\u2019s name previously. Upabarha\u1e47a was specifically expert in decorating himself to attract the attention of women, and thus he became a playboy, as described in the next verse. To be a playboy in this life is unfortunate because too much attraction to women will lead one to fall into the association of \u015b\u016bdras, who can easily take advantage of mingling with women without restriction. In this present Age of Kali, when people are mand\u0101\u1e25 sumanda-mataya\u1e25 \u2014 very bad because of a \u015b\u016bdra mentality \u2014 such free mingling is prominent. Among the higher classes \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya and vai\u015bya \u2014 there is no chance for men to mingle with women freely, but in the \u015b\u016bdra community such mingling is open. Because there is no cultural education in this Age of Kali, everyone is spiritually untrained, and everyone is therefore to be considered \u015b\u016bdra (a\u015buddh\u0101\u1e25 \u015b\u016bdra-kalp\u0101 hi br\u0101hma\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 kali-sambhav\u0101\u1e25). When all the people become \u015b\u016bdras, certainly they are very bad (mand\u0101\u1e25 sumanda-mataya\u1e25). Thus they manufacture their own way of life, with the result that they gradually become unfortunate (manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101\u1e25), and furthermore they are always disturbed by various circumstances."

But here we find that millions and millions of years ago, when N\u0101rada Muni was a Gandharva, he neglected the order to glorify the Lord, and being mad in the association of women, he began to chant otherwise. Thus he was cursed to become a \u015b\u016bdra. His first offense was that he went to join the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana party in the company of lusty women, and another offense was that he considered ordinary songs, like cinema songs and other such songs, to be equal to sa\u1e45k\u012brtana. For this offense he was punished with becoming a \u015b\u016bdra."

A br\u0101hma\u1e47a may be extremely fortunate in having achieved brahma- j\u00f1\u0101na, but the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were so exalted that the Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was living in their house like an ordinary human being. The word bh\u016bri-bh\u0101g\u0101\u1e25 indicates that the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were in a still higher position than brahmac\u0101r\u012bs and br\u0101hma\u1e47as. In the following verses, N\u0101rada Muni repeatedly glorifies the position of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas."
