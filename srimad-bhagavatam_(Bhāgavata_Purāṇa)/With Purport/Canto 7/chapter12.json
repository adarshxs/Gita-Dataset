        "purport": " The relationship between the student or disciple and the wife of the spiritual master or teacher is like that between son and mother. A mother sometimes cares for her son by combing his hair, massaging his body with oil, or bathing him. Similarly, the wife of the teacher is also a mother (guru-patn\u012b), and therefore she may also care for the disciple in a motherly way. If the wife of the teacher is a young woman, however, a young brahmac\u0101r\u012b should not allow such a mother to touch him. This is strictly prohibited. There are seven kinds of mothers: These mothers are the original mother, the wife of the teacher or spiritual master, the wife of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the king\u2019s wife, the cow, the nurse and the earth. Unnecessary association with women, even with one\u2019s mother, sister or daughter, is strictly prohibited. This is human civilization. A civilization that allows men to mix unrestrictedly with women is an animal civilization. In Kali-yuga, people are extremely liberal, but mixing with women and talking with them as equals actually constitutes an uncivilized way of life."

Thus there is every chance that he will fall down because his intelligence is bewildered.",
        "purport": " Here is another important warning that a man must save himself from attraction to woman. Until one is self-realized, fully independent of the illusory conception of the material body, the duality of man and woman must undoubtedly continue, but when one is actually self-realized this distinction ceases. \u201cThe humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].\u201d (Bg. 5.18) On the spiritual platform, the learned person not only gives up the duality of man and woman, but also gives up the duality of man and animal. This is the test of self-realization. One must realize perfectly that the living being is spirit soul but is tasting various types of material bodies. One may theoretically understand this, but when one has practical realization, then he actually becomes a pa\u1e47\u1e0dita, one who knows. Until that time, the duality continues, and the conception of man and woman also continues. In this stage, one should be extremely careful about mixing with women. No one should think himself perfect and forget the \u015b\u0101stric instruction that one should be very careful about associating even with his daughter, mother or sister, not to speak of other women. \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya cites the following \u015blokas in this regard: Unity in variety is real knowledge, and therefore giving up variety artificially does not reflect perfect knowledge of monism. According to the acintya-bhed\u0101bheda philosophy of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, there are varieties, but all of them constitute one unit. Such knowledge is knowledge of perfect oneness."

        "purport": " It is sometimes misunderstood that a g\u1e5bhastha, a householder, is permitted to indulge in sex at any time. This is a wrong conception of g\u1e5bhastha life. In spiritual life, whether one is a g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha, sanny\u0101s\u012b or brahmac\u0101r\u012b, everyone is under the control of the spiritual master. For brahmac\u0101r\u012bs and sanny\u0101s\u012bs there are strong restrictions on sexual indulgence. Similarly, there are strong restrictions for g\u1e5bhasthas. G\u1e5bhasthas should indulge in sex life only in accordance with the order of the guru. Therefore it is mentioned here that one must follow the orders of the spiritual master (guru-v\u1e5bttir vikalpena). When the spiritual master orders, the g\u1e5bhastha may accept sex life. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.11). Dharm\u0101viruddho bh\u016bte\u1e63u k\u0101mo\u00a0\u2019smi: indulgence in sex life without disobedience to the religious rules and regulations constitutes a religious principle. The g\u1e5bhastha is allowed to indulge in sex life during the period favorable for procreation and in accordance with the spiritual master\u2019s order. If the spiritual master\u2019s orders allow a g\u1e5bhastha to engage in sex life at a particular time, then the g\u1e5bhastha may do so; otherwise, if the spiritual master orders against it, the g\u1e5bhastha should abstain. The g\u1e5bhastha must obtain permission from the spiritual master to observe the ritualistic ceremony of garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. Then he may approach his wife to beget children, otherwise not. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a generally remains a brahmac\u0101r\u012b throughout his entire life, but although some br\u0101hma\u1e47as become g\u1e5bhasthas and indulge in sex life, they do so under the complete control of the spiritual master. The k\u1e63atriya is allowed to marry more than one wife, but this also must be in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master. It is not that because one is a g\u1e5bhastha he may marry as many times as he likes and indulge in sex life as he likes. This is not spiritual life. In spiritual life, one must conduct one\u2019s whole life under the guidance of the guru. Only one who executes his spiritual life under the direction of the spiritual master can achieve the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101da\u1e25. If one desires to advance in spiritual life but he acts whimsically, not following the orders of the spiritual master, he has no shelter.

There he should study and learn all the Vedic literatures along with their supplements and the Upani\u1e63ads, according to his ability and power to study. If possible, the student or disciple should reward the spiritual master with the remuneration the spiritual master requests, and then, following the master\u2019s order, the disciple should leave and accept one of the other \u0101\u015bramas, namely the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama, v\u0101naprastha-\u0101\u015brama or sanny\u0101sa-\u0101\u015brama, as he desires.",
        "purport": " To study the Vedas and understand them, of course, requires some special intelligence, but the members of the three higher sections of society \u2014 namely the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas \u2014 must learn the Vedic literatures according to their capability and power to understand. In other words, studying the Vedic literatures is compulsory for everyone but the \u015b\u016bdras and antyajas. The Vedic literature gives the knowledge that can lead one to understand the Absolute Truth \u2014 Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 or Bhagav\u0101n. Gurukula, or the reformatory educational institution, should be used only to understand Vedic knowledge. At the present time there are many educational institutions for training and technology, but such knowledge has nothing to do with understanding of the Absolute Truth. Technology, therefore, is meant for the \u015b\u016bdras, whereas the Vedas are meant for the dvijas. Consequently this verse states, dvijo\u00a0\u2019dh\u012bty\u0101vabudhya ca tray\u012b\u1e41 s\u0101\u1e45gopani\u1e63adam. At the present time, in the Age of Kali, practically everyone is a \u015b\u016bdra, and no one is a dvija. Therefore the condition of society has very much deteriorated. Another point to be observed from this verse is that from the brahmac\u0101r\u012b-\u0101\u015brama one may accept the sanny\u0101sa-\u0101\u015brama, v\u0101naprastha-\u0101\u015brama or g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama. It is not compulsory for a brahmac\u0101r\u012b to become a g\u1e5bhastha. Because the ultimate aim is to understand the Absolute Truth, there is no necessity of going through all the different \u0101\u015bramas. Thus one may proceed to the sanny\u0101sa-\u0101\u015brama directly from the brahmac\u0101r\u012b-\u0101\u015brama. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura accepted the sanny\u0101sa-\u0101\u015brama directly from the brahmac\u0101r\u012b-\u0101\u015brama. In other words, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura did not think it compulsory to accept the g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama or v\u0101naprastha-\u0101\u015brama."

        "purport": " Realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s omnipresence is the perfect realization of the Absolute Truth to be attained through the study of the Vedic literatures. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.35), a\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham: the Lord is situated within the universe, within the heart of every living entity and also within the atom. We should understand that whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present, He is present with all His paraphernalia, including His name, form, associates and servants. The living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus one should understand that since the Supreme Lord has entered the atom, the living entities are also there. One must accept the inconceivable quality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for no one can understand from the material point of view how the Lord is all-pervasive and yet is situated in His own abode, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. This realization is possible if one strictly follows the regulative principles of \u0101\u015brama (brahmac\u0101r\u012b, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa). \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says in this regard: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His original form, has not entered everything (apravi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25), but in His impersonal form He has entered (pravi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25). Thus He has entered and not entered simultaneously. This is also explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.4), wherein the Lord says: \u201cBy Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.\u201d The Lord can defy Himself. Thus there is variety in unity (ekatva\u1e41 bahutvam)."
