He wanted to gain all the yogic perfections like a\u1e47im\u0101 and laghim\u0101, to be deathless, and to be the only king of the entire universe, including Brahmaloka.",
        "purport": " Such are the goals of the austerities performed by demons. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu wanted to receive a benediction from Lord Brahm\u0101 so that in the future he would be able to conquer Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s abode. Similarly, another demon received a benediction from Lord \u015aiva but later wanted to kill Lord \u015aiva through that same benediction. Thus self-interested persons, by demoniac austerity, want to kill even their benedictors, whereas the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava wants to remain an ever-existing servant of the Lord and never to occupy the post of the Lord. Through s\u0101yujya-mukti, which is generally demanded by asuras, one merges into the existence of the Lord, but although one sometimes thus achieves the goal of the theory of monism, one falls down again to struggle in material existence."

        "purport": " In the material world, a servant is provided for by the master but is always planning how to capture the master\u2019s post. There have been many instances of this in history. Especially in India during the Mohammedan rule, many servants, by plans and devices, took over the posts of their masters. It is learned from Caitanya literature that one big Zamindar, Subuddhi R\u0101ya, kept a Mohammedan boy as a servant. Of course, he treated the boy as his own child, and sometimes, when the boy would steal something, the master would chastise him by striking him with a cane. There was a mark on the boy\u2019s back from this chastisement. Later, after that boy had by crooked means become Hussain Shah, Nawab of Bengal, one day his wife saw the mark on his back and inquired about it. The Nawab replied that in his childhood he had been a servant of Subuddhi R\u0101ya, who had punished him because of some mischievous activities. Upon hearing this, the Nawab\u2019s wife immediately became agitated and requested her husband to kill Subuddhi R\u0101ya. Nawab Hussain Shah, of course, was very grateful to Subuddhi R\u0101ya and therefore refused to kill him, but when his wife requested him to turn Subuddhi R\u0101ya into a Mohammedan, the Nawab agreed. Taking some water from his waterpot, he sprinkled it upon Subuddhi R\u0101ya and declared that Subuddhi R\u0101ya had now become a Mohammedan. The point is that this Nawab had been an ordinary menial servant of Subuddhi R\u0101ya but was somehow or other able to occupy the supreme post of Nawab of Bengal. This is the material world. Everyone is trying to become master through various devices, although everyone is servant of his senses. Following this system, a living entity, although servant of his senses, tries to become master of the whole universe. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was a typical example of this, and Brahm\u0101 was informed by the demigods of his intentions."

Brahminical culture and the protection of cows can be increasingly glorified, and thus all kinds of material happiness, opulence and good fortune will automatically increase. But unfortunately, if Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu occupies your seat, everything will be lost.",
        "purport": " In this verse the words dvija-gav\u0101\u1e41 p\u0101rame\u1e63\u1e6dhyam indicate the most exalted position of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, brahminical culture and the cows. In Vedic culture, the welfare of the cows and the welfare of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are essential. Without a proper arrangement for developing brahminical culture and protecting cows, all the affairs of administration will go to hell. Being afraid that Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu would occupy the post of Brahm\u0101, all the demigods were extremely disturbed. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was a well-known demon, and the demigods knew that if demons and R\u0101k\u1e63asas were to occupy the supreme post, brahminical culture and protection of cows would come to an end. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29), the original proprietor of everything is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram). The Lord, therefore, knows particularly well how to develop the material condition of the living entities within this material world. In every universe there is one Brahm\u0101 engaged on behalf of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (tene brahma h\u1e5bd\u0101 ya \u0101di-kavaye). The principal creator in each brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da is Lord Brahm\u0101, who imparts Vedic knowledge to his disciples and sons. On every planet, the king or supreme controller must be a representative of Brahm\u0101. Therefore, if a R\u0101k\u1e63asa, or demon, were situated in Brahm\u0101\u2019s post, then the entire arrangement of the universe, especially the protection of the brahminical culture and cows, would be ruined. All the demigods anticipated this danger, and therefore they went to request Lord Brahm\u0101 to take immediate steps to thwart Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s plan. In the beginning of creation, Lord Brahm\u0101 was attacked by two demons \u2014 Madhu and Kai\u1e6dabha \u2014 but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a saved him. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is addressed as madhu-kai\u1e6dabha-hant\u1e5b. Now again, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was trying to replace Brahm\u0101. The material world is so situated that even the position of Lord Brahm\u0101, not to speak of ordinary living entities, is sometimes in danger. Nonetheless, until the time of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, no one had tried to replace Lord Brahm\u0101. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, however, was such a great demon that he maintained this ambition. The word bh\u016btyai means \u201cfor increasing opulence,\u201d and the word \u015breyase refers to ultimately returning home, back to Godhead. In spiritual advancement, one\u2019s material position improves at the same time that the path of liberation becomes clear and one is freed from material bondage. If one is situated in an opulent position in spiritual advancement, his opulence never decreases. Therefore such a spiritual benediction is called bh\u016bti or vibh\u016bti. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a confirms this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.41). Yad yad vibh\u016btimat sattva\u1e41 \u2026 mama tejo-\u2019\u1e41\u015ba-sambhavam: if a devotee advances in spiritual consciousness and thus becomes materially opulent also, his position is a special gift from the Lord. Such opulence is never to be considered material. At the present, especially on this planet earth, the influence of Lord Brahm\u0101 has decreased considerably, and the representatives of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu \u2014 the R\u0101k\u1e63asas and demons \u2014 have taken charge. Therefore there is no protection of brahminical culture and cows, which are the basic prerequisites for all kinds of good fortune. This age is very dangerous because society is being managed by demons and R\u0101k\u1e63asas."

Because Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu had been there for a long time, the ants had devoured his skin, fat, flesh and blood. Then Lord Brahm\u0101 and the demigods spotted him, resembling a cloud-covered sun, heating all the world by his austerity. Struck with wonder, Lord Brahm\u0101 began to smile and then addressed him as follows.",
        "purport": " The living entity can live merely by his own power, without the help of skin, marrow, bone, blood and so on, because it is said, asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25 \u2014 the living entity has nothing to do with the material covering. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu performed a severe type of tapasya, austerity, for many long years. Indeed, it is said that he performed the tapasya for one hundred heavenly years. Since one day of the demigods equals six of our months, certainly this was a very long time. By nature\u2019s own way, his body had been almost consumed by earthworms, ants and other parasites, and therefore even Brahm\u0101 was at first unable to see him. Later, however, Brahm\u0101 could ascertain where Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was, and Brahm\u0101 was struck with wonder to see Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s extraordinary power to execute tapasya. Anyone would conclude that Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was dead because his body was covered in so many ways, but Lord Brahm\u0101, the supreme living being in this universe, could understand that Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was alive but covered by material elements. It is also to be noted that although Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu performed this austerity for a long, long time, he was nonetheless known as a Daitya and R\u0101k\u1e63asa. It will be seen from verses to follow that even great saintly persons could not perform such a severe type of austerity. Why then was he called a R\u0101k\u1e63asa and Daitya? It is because whatever he did was for his own sense gratification. His son Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was only five years old, and so what could Prahl\u0101da do? Yet simply by performing a little devotional service according to the instructions of N\u0101rada Muni, Prahl\u0101da became so dear to the Lord that the Lord came to save him, whereas Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, in spite of all his austerities, was killed. This is the difference between devotional service and all other methods of perfection. One who performs severe austerities for sense gratification is fearful to the entire world, whereas a devotee who performs even a slight amount of devotional service is a friend to everyone (suh\u1e5bda\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m). Since the Lord is the well-wisher of every living entity and since a devotee assumes the qualities of the Lord, a devotee also acts for everyone\u2019s good fortune by performing devotional service. Thus although Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu performed such a severe austerity, he remained a Daitya and a R\u0101k\u1e63asa, whereas Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, although born of the same Daitya father, became the most exalted devotee and was personally protected by the Supreme Lord. Bhakti is therefore called sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmuktam, indicating that a devotee is freed from all material designations, and any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam, situated in a transcendental position, free from all material desires."

        "purport": " Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.23-24): \u201cWhatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunt\u012b, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding. I am the only enjoyer and the only object of sacrifice. Those who do not recognize My true transcendental nature fall down.\u201d In effect, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cPersons engaged in the worship of demigods are not very intelligent, although such worship is indirectly offered to Me.\u201d For example, when a man pours water on the leaves and branches of a tree without pouring water on the root, he does so without sufficient knowledge or without observing regulative principles. The process of watering a tree is to pour water on the root. Similarly, the process of rendering service to different parts of the body is to supply food to the stomach. The demigods are, so to speak, different officers and directors in the government of the Supreme Lord. One has to follow the laws made by the government, not by the officers or directors. Similarly, everyone is to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord only. That will automatically satisfy the different officers and directors of the Lord. The officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the government, and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal. This is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as avidhi-p\u016brvakam. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not approve the unnecessary worship of the demigods. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly stated that there are many types of yaj\u00f1a performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord. Yaj\u00f1a means Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the Third Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly stated that one should work only for satisfying Yaj\u00f1a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, is specifically meant for satisfying Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cI am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme master.\u201d However, less intelligent persons, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired result. Although Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu offered his obeisances unto Lord Brahm\u0101, he was strongly inimical toward Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This is the symptom of an asura. Asuras worship the demigods as being separate from the Lord, not knowing that all the demigods are powerful because of being servants of the Lord. If the Supreme Lord were to withdraw the powers of the demigods, the demigods would no longer be able to offer benedictions to their worshipers. The difference between a devotee and a nondevotee, or asura, is that a devotee knows that Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that everyone derives power from Him. Without worshiping the demigods for particular powers, a devotee worships Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, knowing that if he desires a particular power he can get that power while acting as Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s devotee. Therefore in the \u015b\u0101stra (Bh\u0101g. 2.3.10) it is recommended: \u201cA person who has broader intelligence, whether he be full of material desires, free from material desires, or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead.\u201d Even if a person has material desires, instead of worshiping the demigods he should pray to the Supreme Lord so that his connection with the Supreme Lord will be established and he will be saved from becoming a demon or a nondevotee. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya gives the following quotation from the Brahma-tarka: Since Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the Supreme, by worshiping Vi\u1e63\u1e47u one can fulfill all one\u2019s desires. There is no need to divert one\u2019s attention to any demigod."

It is because of his activities that everything within the universe is visible. He is therefore the cause of all manifestations.",
        "purport": " The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra begins by declaring that the Absolute Person is the original source of all creation (janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25). One may ask whether Lord Brahm\u0101 is the Supreme Absolute Person. No, the Supreme Absolute Person is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Brahm\u0101 receives his mind, intelligence, materials and everything else from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and then he becomes the secondary creator, the engineer of this universe. In this regard we may note that the creation does not take place accidentally, because of the explosion of a chunk. Such nonsensical theories are not accepted by Vedic students. The first created living being is Brahm\u0101, who is endowed with perfect knowledge and intelligence by the Lord. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, tene brahma h\u1e5bd\u0101 ya \u0101di-kavaye: although Brahm\u0101 is the first created being, he is not independent, for he receives help from the Supreme Personality of Godhead through his heart. There is no one but Brahm\u0101 at the time of creation, and therefore he receives his intelligence directly from the Lord through the heart. This has been discussed in the beginning of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Lord Brahm\u0101 is described in this verse as the original cause of the cosmic manifestation, and this applies to his position in the material world. There are many, many such controllers, all of whom are created by the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. This is illustrated by an incident described in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta. When the Brahm\u0101 of this particular universe was invited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Dv\u0101rak\u0101, he thought that he was the only Brahm\u0101. Therefore when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a inquired from His servant which Brahm\u0101 was at the door to visit, Lord Brahm\u0101 was surprised. He replied that of course Lord Brahm\u0101, the father of the four Kum\u0101ras, was waiting at the door. Later, Lord Brahm\u0101 asked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a why He had inquired which Brahm\u0101 had come. He was then informed that there are millions of other Brahm\u0101s because there are millions of universes. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a then called all the Brahm\u0101s, who immediately came to visit Him. The catur-mukha Brahm\u0101, the four-headed Brahm\u0101 of this universe, thought himself a very insignificant creature in the presence of so many Brahm\u0101s with so many heads. Thus although there is a Brahm\u0101 who is the engineer of each universe, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original source of all of them."

The external potency manifests this material world, the internal potency manifests the spiritual world, and the marginal potency manifests the living entities, who are mixtures of internal and external. The living entity, being part and parcel of Parabrahman, is actually internal potency, but because of being in contact with the material energy, he is an emanation of material and spiritual energies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is above the material energy and is engaged in spiritual pastimes. The material energy is only an external manifestation of His pastimes."

Therefore Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was careful to guard against all kinds of weapons. He guarded against all kinds of time, space and countries because he was afraid of being killed by someone else in another land. There are many other planets, higher and lower, and therefore he prayed for the benediction of not being killed by any resident of any of these planets. There are three original deities \u2014 Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Mahe\u015bvara.

Thus Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu thought himself securely protected from any kind of death caused by any living entity within this universe.
