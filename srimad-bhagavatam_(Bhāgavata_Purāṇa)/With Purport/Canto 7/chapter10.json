Therefore, kindly do not tempt me with these illusions. I am very much afraid of material conditions, and I desire to be liberated from materialistic life. It is for this reason that I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet.",
        "purport": " Materialistic life means attachment to the body and everything in relationship to the body. This attachment is based on lusty desires for sense gratification, specifically sexual enjoyment. K\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25: when one is too attached to material enjoyment, he is bereft of all knowledge (h\u1e5bta- j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25). As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, those who are attached to material enjoyment are mostly inclined to worship the demigods to procure various material opulences. They are especially attached to worship of the goddess Durg\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva because this transcendental couple can offer their devotees all material opulence. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, was detached from all material enjoyment. He therefore took shelter of the lotus feet of Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, and not the feet of any demigod. It is to be understood that if one really wants release from this material world, from the threefold miseries and from janma-m\u1e5btyu-jar\u0101-vy\u0101dhi (birth, death, old age and disease), one must take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for without the Supreme Personality of Godhead one cannot get release from materialistic life. Atheistic men are very much attached to material enjoyment. Therefore if they get some opportunity to achieve more and more material enjoyment, they take it. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, however, was very careful in this regard. Although born of a materialistic father, because he was a devotee he had no material desires (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam)."

Nitya-siddha devotees come from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha to this material world to teach, by their personal example, how to become a devotee. The living entities in this material world can take lessons from such nitya-siddha devotees and thus become inclined to return home, back to Godhead. A nitya-siddha devotee comes from Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha upon the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and shows by his example how to become a pure devotee (any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam). In spite of coming to this material world, the nitya-siddha devotee is never attracted by the allurements of material enjoyment. A perfect example is Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who was a nitya-siddha, a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata devotee. Although Prahl\u0101da was born in the family of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, an atheist, he was never attached to any kind of materialistic enjoyment. Desiring to exhibit the symptoms of a pure devotee, the Lord tried to induce Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja to take material benedictions, but Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja did not accept them. On the contrary, by his personal example he showed the symptoms of a pure devotee. In other words, the Lord Himself has no desire to send His pure devotee to this material world, nor does a devotee have any material purpose in coming. When the Lord Himself appears as an incarnation within this material world, He is not allured by the material atmosphere, and He has nothing to do with material activity, yet by His example He teaches the common man how to become a devotee. Similarly, a devotee who comes here in accordance with the order of the Supreme Lord shows by his personal behavior how to become a pure devotee. A pure devotee, therefore, is a practical example for all living entities, including Lord Brahm\u0101."

On the other hand, one who desires some material benefit in exchange for devotional service cannot be Your pure devotee. Indeed, he is no better than a merchant who wants profit in exchange for service.",
        "purport": " It is sometimes found that one comes to a devotee or a temple of the Lord just to get some material benefit. Such a person is described here as a mercantile man. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 speaks of \u0101rto jij\u00f1\u0101sur arth\u0101rth\u012b. The word \u0101rta refers to one who is physically distressed, and arth\u0101rth\u012b refers to one in need of money. Such persons are forced to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for mitigation of their distress or to get some money by the benediction of the Lord. They have been described as suk\u1e5bt\u012b, pious, because in their distress or need for money they have approached the Supreme Lord. Unless one is pious, one cannot approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, although a pious man may receive some material benefit, one who is concerned with material benefits cannot be a pure devotee. When a pure devotee receives material opulences, this is not because of his pious activity but for the service of the Lord. When one engages in devotional service, one is automatically pious. Therefore, a pure devotee is any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam. He has no desire for material profit, nor does the Lord induce him to try to profit materially. When a devotee needs something, the Supreme Personality of Godhead supplies it (yoga-k\u1e63ema\u1e41 vah\u0101my aham). Sometimes materialists go to a temple to offer flowers and fruit to the Lord because they have learned from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that if a devotee offers some flowers and fruits, the Lord accepts them. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26) the Lord says: \u201cIf one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.\u201d Thus a man with a mercantile mentality thinks that if he can get some material benefit, like a large amount of money, simply by offering a little fruit and flower, this is good business. Such persons are not accepted as pure devotees. Because their desires are not purified, they are still mercantile men, even though they go to temples to make a show of being devotees. Sarvop\u0101dhi-vinirmukta\u1e41 tat-paratvena nirmalam: only when one is fully freed from material desires can one be purified, and only in that purified state can one serve the Lord. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u1e47a h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-sevana\u1e41 bhaktir ucyate. This is the pure devotional platform."

        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.20), k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante\u00a0\u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25. \u201cThose whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods.\u201d A demigod cannot become master, for the real master is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demigods, to keep their prestigious positions, bestow upon their worshipers whatever benedictions the worshipers want. For example, once it was found that an asura took a benediction from Lord \u015aiva by which the asura would be able to kill someone simply by placing his hands on that person\u2019s head. Such benedictions are possible to receive from the demigods. If one worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, the Lord will never offer him such condemned benedictions. On the contrary, it is said in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.88.8), yasy\u0101ham anug\u1e5bhn\u0101mi hari\u1e63ye tad-dhana\u1e41 \u015banai\u1e25. If one is too materialistic but at the same time wants to be a servant of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, because of His supreme compassion for the devotee, takes away all his material opulences and obliges him to be a pure devotee of the Lord. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja distinguishes between the pure devotee and the pure master. The Lord is the pure master, the supreme master, whereas an unalloyed devotee with no material motives is the pure servant. One who has materialistic motivations cannot become a servant, and one who unnecessarily bestows benedictions upon his servant to keep his own prestigious position is not a real master."

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29), bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101\u1e41 sarva-loka-mahe\u015bvaram: \u201cI am the proprietor of all planets, and I am the supreme enjoyer.\u201d This is the natural position of the Lord, and the natural position of the living being is to surrender unto Him (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). If this relationship continues, then real happiness exists eternally between the master and servant. Unfortunately, when this eternal relationship is disturbed, the living entity wants to become separately happy and thinks that the master is his order supplier. In this way there cannot be happiness. Nor should the master cater to the desires of the servant. If he does, he is not the real master. The real master commands, \u201cYou must do this,\u201d and the real servant immediately obeys the order. Unless this relationship between the Supreme Lord and the subordinate living entity is established, there can be no real happiness. The living entity is \u0101\u015braya, always subordinate, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is vi\u1e63aya, the supreme objective, the goal of life. Unfortunate persons trapped in this material world do not know this. Na te vidu\u1e25 sv\u0101rtha-gati\u1e41 hi vi\u1e63\u1e47um: illusioned by the material energy, everyone in this material world is unaware that the only aim of life is to approach Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a Lord \u015aiva explains to his wife, Parvat\u012b, the goddess Durg\u0101, that the highest goal of life is to satisfy Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who can be satisfied only when His servant is satisfied. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore teaches, gop\u012b-bhartu\u1e25 pada-kamalayor d\u0101sa-d\u0101s\u0101nud\u0101sa\u1e25. One must become a servant of the servant. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja also prayed to Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva that he might be engaged as the servant of the Lord\u2019s servant. This is the prescribed method of devotional service. As soon as a devotee wants the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be his order supplier, the Lord immediately refuses to become the master of such a motivated devotee. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.11) the Lord says, ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101\u1e41s tathaiva bhaj\u0101my aham. \u201cAs one surrenders unto Me, I reward him accordingly.\u201d Materialistic persons are generally inclined to material profits. As long as one continues in such an adulterated position, he does not receive the benefit of returning home, back to Godhead."

Liberation means freedom from lusty desires because it is only due to such desires that one must accept repeated birth and death. As long as one\u2019s lusty desires are unfulfilled, one must take birth after birth to fulfill them. Because of material desires, therefore, one performs various types of activities and receives various types of bodies with which to try to fulfill desires that are never satisfied. The only remedy is to take to devotional service, which begins when one is free from all material desires. Any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam. Anya-abhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101 means \u201cmaterial desire,\u201d and \u015b\u016bnyam means \u201cfree from.\u201d The spiritual soul has spiritual activities and spiritual desires, as described by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu: mama janmani janman\u012b\u015bvare bhavat\u0101d bhaktir ahaituk\u012b tvayi. Unalloyed devotion to the service of the Lord is the only spiritual desire. To fulfill this spiritual desire, however, one must be free from all material desires. Desirelessness means freedom from material desires. This is described by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnyam. As soon as one has material desires, one loses his spiritual identity. Then all the paraphernalia of one\u2019s life, including one\u2019s senses, body, religion, patience and intelligence, are deviated from one\u2019s original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As soon as one has material desires, one cannot properly use his senses, intelligence, mind and so on for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers want to become impersonal, senseless and mindless, but that is not possible. The living entity must be living, always existing with desires, ambitions and so on. These should be purified, however, so that one can desire spiritually and be spiritually ambitious, without material contamination. In every living entity these propensities exist because he is a living entity. When materially contaminated, however, one is put into the hands of material misery (janma-m\u1e5btyu-jar\u0101-vy\u0101dhi). If one wants to stop repeated birth and death, one must take to the devotional service of the Lord. \u201cBhakti, or devotional service, means engaging all our senses in the service of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all the senses. When the spirit soul renders service unto the Supreme, there are two side effects. One is freed from all material designations, and, simply by being employed in the service of the Lord, one\u2019s senses are purified.\u201d"

Nonetheless, I order you to enjoy the opulences of the demons in this material world, acting as their king until the end of the duration of time occupied by Manu.",
        "purport": " One Manu lives for a duration of time calculated to be an aggregate of seventy-one yuga cycles, each of which equals 4,300,000 years. Although atheistic men like to enjoy material opulences and they endeavor with great energy to build big residences, roads, cities and factories, unfortunately they cannot live more than eighty, ninety or at the utmost one hundred years. Although the materialist exerts so much energy to create a kingdom of hallucinations, he is unable to enjoy it for more than a few years. However, because Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a devotee, the Lord allowed him to enjoy material opulence as the king of the materialists. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja had taken birth in the family of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, who was the topmost materialist, and since Prahl\u0101da was the bona fide heir of his father, the Supreme Lord allowed him to enjoy the kingdom created by his father for so many years that no materialist could calculate them. A devotee does not have to desire material opulence, but if he is a pure devotee, there is ample opportunity for him to enjoy material happiness also, without personal endeavor. Therefore, everyone is advised to take to devotional service under all circumstances. If one desires material opulence, he can also become a pure devotee, and his desires will be fulfilled. It is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.3.10): \u201cWhether one desires everything or nothing, or whether he desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service.\u201d"

        "purport": " When a devotee becomes materially very opulent, one should not think that he is enjoying the results of his fruitive activities. A devotee in this material world uses all material opulences for the service of the Lord because he is planning how to serve the Lord with these opulences, as advised by the Lord Himself. Whatever material opulence is within his possession he engages to expand the glories and service of the Lord. A devotee never performs any fruitive or ritualistic ceremony to enjoy the results of such karma. Rather, a devotee knows that karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da is meant for the less intelligent man. Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura says in his Prema-bhakti-candrik\u0101, karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, kevala vi\u1e63era bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da: both karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da and j\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da \u2014 fruitive activities and speculation about the Supreme Lord \u2014 are like pots of poison.

There are two classes of devotees \u2014 the s\u0101dhana-siddha and the nitya-siddha. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is a mixed siddha; that is, he is perfect partly because of executing devotional service and partly because of eternal perfection. Thus he is compared to such devotees as N\u0101rada. Formerly, N\u0101rada Muni was the son of a maidservant, and therefore in his next birth he attained perfection (s\u0101dhana-siddhi) because of having executed devotional service. Yet he is also a nitya-siddha because he never forgets the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word ku\u015balena is very important. One should live in the material world very expertly. The material world is known as the world of duality because one sometimes has to act impiously and sometimes has to act piously. Although one does not want to act impiously, the world is so fashioned that there is always danger (pada\u1e41 pada\u1e41 yad vipad\u0101m). Thus even when performing devotional service a devotee has to create many enemies. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja himself had experience of this, for even his father became his enemy. A devotee should expertly manage to think always of the Supreme Lord so that the reactions of suffering cannot touch him. This is the expert management of p\u0101pa-pu\u1e47ya \u2014 pious and impious activities. An exalted devotee like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is j\u012bvan-mukta; he is liberated even in this very life in the material body."

This constant thought of the Lord makes the devotee eligible to return home, back to Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9), tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janma naiti m\u0101m eti: after giving up his body, a devotee does not again receive a material body, but goes back to Godhead and receives a spiritual body resembling those of the Lord\u2019s eternal associates whose activities he followed. However the devotee likes to serve the Lord, he may constantly think of the Lord\u2019s associates \u2014 the cowherd boys, the gop\u012bs, the Lord\u2019s father and mother, His servants and the trees, land, animals, plants and water in the Lord\u2019s abode.

The j\u00f1\u0101na-bhakta, the devotee who follows the path of j\u00f1\u0101na, also attains the same destination. If even the enemies of the Lord achieve salvation by constantly thinking about the Lord, what is to be said of pure devotees who always engage in the Lord\u2019s service and who think of nothing but the Lord in every activity?"

        "purport": " Avat\u0101ras, or incarnations, are expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Govinda. \u201cI worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is the original person \u2014 nondual, infallible, and without beginning. Although He expands into unlimited forms, He is still the original, and although He is the oldest person, He always appears as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful and all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot be understood by the academic wisdom of the Vedas, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.33) The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 describes the avat\u0101ras. Indeed, all the avat\u0101ras are described in the authentic scriptures. No one can become an avat\u0101ra, or incarnation, although this has become fashionable in the Age of Kali. The avat\u0101ras are described in the authentic scriptures (\u015b\u0101stras), and therefore before one risks accepting a pretender as an avat\u0101ra, one should refer to the \u015b\u0101stras. The \u015b\u0101stras say everywhere that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Personality of Godhead and that He has innumerable avat\u0101ras, or incarnations. Elsewhere in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said, r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan: R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha and many others are consecutive expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes Balar\u0101ma, after Balar\u0101ma is Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, then Aniruddha, Pradyumna, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and then the puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ras \u2014 Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. All of them are avat\u0101ras. One must hear about the avat\u0101ras. Narrations about such avat\u0101ras are called avat\u0101ra-kath\u0101, the narrations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s expansions. Hearing and chanting these narrations is completely pious. \u015a\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana\u1e25. One who hears and chants can become pu\u1e47ya, purified of material contamination. Whenever there are references to the avat\u0101ras, religious principles are established, and demons who are against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are killed. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is spreading all over the world with two aims \u2014 to establish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to kill all the pretenders who falsely present themselves as avat\u0101ras. The preachers of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement must carry this conviction very carefully within their hearts and kill the demons who in many tactful ways vilify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If we take shelter of N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva and Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, it will be easier to kill the demons who are against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and to thus reestablish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supremacy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord, the original Lord. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is our guru, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is our worshipable God. As advised by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, guru-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101de p\u0101ya bhakti-lat\u0101-b\u012bja. If we can be successful in getting the mercy of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja and also that of N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, then our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement will be extremely successful. The demon Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu had so many ways to try to become God himself, but although Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was chastised and threatened in many ways, he rigidly refused to accept his powerful demoniac father as God. Following in the footsteps of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, we should reject all the rascals who pretend to be God. We must accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His incarnations, and no one else."

Great saintly persons know this very well, and therefore they constantly visit this house.",
        "purport": " After hearing about the activities of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, a pure devotee should be very anxious to follow in his footsteps, but such a devotee might be disappointed, thinking that not every devotee can come to the standard of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. This is the nature of a pure devotee; he always thinks himself to be the lowest, to be incompetent and unqualified. Thus after hearing the narration of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s activities, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, who was on the same standard of devotional service as Prahl\u0101da, might have been thinking of his own humble position. N\u0101rada Muni, however, could understand Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s mind, and therefore he immediately encouraged him by saying that the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were not less fortunate; they were as good as Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja because although Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva appeared for Prahl\u0101da, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was always living with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. Although the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, because of the influence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s yoga-m\u0101y\u0101, could not think of their fortunate position, every saintly person, including the great sage N\u0101rada, could understand it, and therefore they constantly visited Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Any pure devotee who is constantly conscious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is naturally very fortunate. The word n\u1e5b-loke, meaning \u201cwithin the material world,\u201d indicates that before the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas there had been many, many devotees, such as the descendants of the Yadu dynasty and Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, Mar\u012bci, Ka\u015byapa, Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, who were all extremely fortunate. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, however, were better than all of them because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself lived with them constantly. N\u0101rada Muni therefore specifically mentioned that within this material world (n\u1e5b-loke) the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas were the most fortunate."

        "purport": " There is always a difference of opinion about the Absolute Truth. One class of transcendentalists concludes that the Absolute Truth is impersonal, and another class concludes that the Absolute Truth is a person. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Absolute Truth is accepted as the Supreme Person. Indeed, that Supreme Person Himself, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, instructs in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham, matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat. \u201cThe impersonal Brahman is My partial manifestation, and there is no truth superior to Me.\u201d That same K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, acted as the supreme friend and relative of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and sometimes He even acted as their servant by carrying a letter from the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Duryodhana. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was the well-wisher of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, He also acted as guru by becoming the spiritual master of Arjuna. Arjuna accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his spiritual master (\u015bi\u1e63yas te\u00a0\u2019ha\u1e41 \u015b\u0101dhi m\u0101\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 prapannam), and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sometimes chastised him. For example, the Lord said, a\u015bocy\u0101n anva\u015bocas tva\u1e41 praj\u00f1\u0101-v\u0101d\u0101\u1e41\u015b ca bh\u0101\u1e63ase: \u201cWhile speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief.\u201d The Lord also said, kutas tv\u0101 ka\u015bmalam ida\u1e41 vi\u1e63ame samupasthitam: \u201cMy dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you?\u201d Such was the intimate relationship between the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the same way, a pure devotee of the Lord is always with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through thick and thin; his way of life is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the statement of the authority \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni."

        "purport": " The asuras are generally extremely powerful because of their mystic yogic power. However, as Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.47): \u201cOf all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\u201d The actual purpose of mystic yoga is to concentrate one\u2019s attention fully on the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and always think of Him (mad-gaten\u0101ntar\u0101tman\u0101). To attain such perfection, one must undergo a certain process \u2014 ha\u1e6dha-yoga \u2014 and through this yoga system the practitioner achieves some uncommon mystic power. The asuras, however, instead of becoming devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, utilize this mystic power for their personal sense gratification. Maya D\u0101nava, for example, is mentioned here as mah\u0101-yog\u012b, a great mystic, but his business was to help the asuras. Nowadays we are actually seeing that there are some yog\u012bs who cater to the senses of materialists, and there are imposters who advertise themselves as God. Maya D\u0101nava was such a person, a god among the demons, and he could perform some wonderful feats, one of which is described here: he made a well filled with nectar and dipped the asuras into that nectarean well. This nectar was known as m\u1e5bta-sanj\u012bvayitari, for it could bring a dead body to life. M\u1e5bta-sanj\u012bvayitari is also an \u0100yurvedic preparation. It is a kind of liquor that invigorates even a person on the verge of death."

        "purport": " Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and all the Vedic literatures fully explain that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appears in human society as an ordinary human being but acts very uncommonly for the well-being of the entire world. One should not be influenced by the illusory energy and think Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being. Those who really seek the Absolute Truth come to the understanding that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everything (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti). Such great souls are very rare. Nonetheless, if one studies the entire Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very easy to understand. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is just trying to make K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a known all over the world as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam). If people take this movement seriously, their lives as human beings will be successful."
