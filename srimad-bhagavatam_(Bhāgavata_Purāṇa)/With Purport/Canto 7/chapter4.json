These scientists claim to have launched excursions to the moon, where they have found no living entities but only big craters full of dust and stone, although in fact the moon is so brilliant that it acts like the sun in illuminating the entire universe. Of course, it is not possible to convince modern scientists of the Vedic information about the universe.

        "purport": " From this description it appears that all the heavenly planets of the upper planetary system are thousands upon thousands of times more opulent than the lower planetary system in which we live. Vi\u015bvakarm\u0101, the famous heavenly architect, is known as the constructor of many wonderful buildings in the upper planets, where there are not only beautiful buildings, but also many opulent gardens and parks, which are described as nandana-devody\u0101na, gardens quite fit to be enjoyed by the demigods. This description of the upper planetary system and its opulences is to be understood from authoritative scriptures like the Vedic literatures. Telescopes and the other imperfect instruments of scientists are inadequate for evaluating the upper planetary system. Although such instruments are needed because the vision of the so-called scientists is imperfect, the instruments themselves are also imperfect. Therefore the upper planets cannot be appraised by imperfect men using imperfect man-made instruments. Direct information received from the Vedic literature, however, is perfect. We therefore cannot accept the statement that there are no opulent residences on planets other than this earth."

The ladies of the palace, who were blessed with beautiful teeth and the most wonderfully beautiful faces, walked here and there in the palace, their ankle bells tinkling melodiously, and saw their own beautiful reflections in the gems. The demigods, however, being very much oppressed, had to bow down and offer obeisances at the feet of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, who chastised the demigods very severely and for no reason. Thus Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu lived in the palace and severely ruled everyone.",

Indeed, they were afraid of being severely punished if they disobeyed him. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b has compared Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu to Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Vena, who was also atheistic and scornful of the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas. Yet Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Vena was afraid of some of the great sages such as Bh\u1e5bgu, whereas Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu ruled in such a way that everyone feared him but Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lord Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was so alert against being burnt to ashes by the anger of great sages like Bh\u1e5bgu that by dint of austerity he surpassed their power and placed even them under his subordination. It appears that even in the higher planetary systems, to which people are promoted by pious activities, disturbances are created by asuras like Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu. No one in the three worlds can live in peace and prosperity without disturbance."

In considering the word mad-dar\u015banam, \u201cseeing Me,\u201d which is mentioned in this verse, one should note that in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti. In other words, the ability to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead or to see Him or talk with Him depends on one\u2019s advancement in devotional service, which is called bhakti. In bhakti there are nine different activities: \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam/ arcana\u1e41 vandana\u1e41 d\u0101sya\u1e41 sakhyam \u0101tma-nivedanam. Because all these devotional activities are absolute, there is no fundamental difference between worshiping the Deity in the temple, seeing Him and chanting His glories. Indeed, all of these are ways of seeing Him, for everything done in devotional service is a means of direct contact with the Lord. The vibration of the Lord\u2019s voice appeared in the presence of all the devotees, and although the person vibrating the sound was unseen to them, they were meeting or seeing the Lord because they were offering prayers and because the vibration of the Lord was present. Contrary to the laws of the material world, there is no difference between seeing the Lord, offering prayers and hearing the transcendental vibration. Pure devotees, therefore, are fully satisfied by glorifying the Lord. Such glorification is called k\u012brtana. Performing k\u012brtana and hearing the vibration of the sound Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly. One must realize this position, and then one will be able to understand the absolute nature of the Lord\u2019s activities."

        "purport": " Of all sinful activities, an offense to a pure devotee, or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, is the most severe. An offense at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is so disastrous that \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has compared it to a mad elephant that enters a garden and causes great havoc by uprooting many plants and trees. If one is an offender at the lotus feet of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, his offenses uproot all his auspicious activities. One should therefore very carefully guard against committing vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dha, or offenses at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Here the Lord clearly says that although Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu had received benedictions from Lord Brahm\u0101, these benedictions would be null and void as soon as he committed an offense at the lotus feet of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, his own son. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is described herein as nirvaira, having no enemies. Elsewhere in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.25.21) it is said, aj\u0101ta-\u015batrava\u1e25 \u015b\u0101nt\u0101\u1e25 s\u0101dhava\u1e25 s\u0101dhu-bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101\u1e25: a devotee has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime. A devotee does not create enmity with anyone, but if someone becomes his enemy, that person will be vanquished by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, despite whatever benedictions he may have received from other sources. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was certainly enjoying the fruitful results of his austerities, but here the Lord says that as soon as he committed an offense at the lotus feet of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja he would be ruined. One\u2019s longevity, opulence, beauty, education and whatever else one may possess as a result of pious activities cannot protect one if one commits an offense at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Despite whatever one possesses, if one offends the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava he will be vanquished."

He had full control of his senses and mind. Like the Supersoul, he was kind to every living entity and was the best friend of everyone. To respectable persons he acted exactly like a menial servant, to the poor he was like a father, to his equals he was attached like a sympathetic brother, and he considered his teachers, spiritual masters and older Godbrothers to be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was completely free from unnatural pride that might have arisen from his good education, riches, beauty, aristocracy and so on.",
        "purport": " These are some of the qualifications of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is automatically a br\u0101hma\u1e47a because a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava has all the good qualities of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. \u201cPeacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness \u2014 these are the qualities by which the br\u0101hma\u1e47as work.\u201d (Bg. 18.42) These qualities are manifest in the body of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Therefore a perfect Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is also a perfect br\u0101hma\u1e47a, as indicated here by the words brahma\u1e47ya\u1e25 \u015b\u012bla-sampanna\u1e25. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always determined to understand the Absolute Truth, and to understand the Absolute Truth one needs to have full control over his senses and mind. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja possessed all these qualities. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always a well-wisher to everyone. The Six Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, for example, are described in this way: dh\u012br\u0101dh\u012bra-jana-priyau. They were popular with both the gentle and the ruffians. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava must be equal to everyone, regardless of one\u2019s position. \u0101tmavat: a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava should be like Param\u0101tm\u0101. \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be\u00a0\u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati. Param\u0101tm\u0101 does not hate anyone; indeed, He is in the heart of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, but he is also even in the heart of a pig. As the moon never refuses to distribute its pleasing rays even to the home of a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava never refuses to act for everyone\u2019s welfare. Therefore a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is always obedient to the spiritual master (\u0101rya). The word \u0101rya refers to one who is advanced in knowledge. One who is deficient in knowledge cannot be called \u0101rya. At the present, however, the word \u0101rya is used to refer to those who are godless. This is the unfortunate situation of Kali-yuga. The word guru refers to the spiritual master who initiates his disciple into advancement in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as stated by \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura (\u015br\u012b-bhagavan-mantropade\u015bake gur\u0101v ity artha\u1e25)."

        "translation": "From the very beginning of his childhood, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was uninterested in childish playthings. Indeed, he gave them up altogether and remained silent and dull, being fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Since his mind was always affected by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he could not understand how the world goes on being fully absorbed in the activities of sense gratification.",
        "purport": " Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is the vivid example of a great person fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 8.274) it is said: A fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, although situated in this material world, does not see anything but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, anywhere and everywhere. This is the sign of a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata. The mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere because of his attitude of pure love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38): \u201cI worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of \u015ay\u0101masundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.\u201d An exalted devotee, or mah\u0101tm\u0101, who is rarely to be seen, remains fully conscious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and constantly sees the Lord within the core of his heart. It is sometimes said that when one is influenced by evil stars like Saturn, R\u0101hu or Ketu, he cannot make advancement in any prospective activity. In just the opposite way, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was influenced by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme planet, and thus he could not think of the material world and live without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is the sign of a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata. Even if one is an enemy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata sees him to be also engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. Another crude example is that everything appears yellow to the jaundiced eye. Similarly, to a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, everyone but himself appears to be engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is the approved mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, the supreme devotee. In the previous verse it was stated that he had natural attachment (naisargik\u012b rati\u1e25). The symptoms of such natural attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are described in this verse. Although Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was only a boy, he had no interest in playing. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.2.42), viraktir anyatra ca: the symptom of perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is that one loses interest in all material activities. For a small boy to give up playing is impossible, but Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, being situated in first-class devotional service, was always absorbed in a trance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Just as a materialistic person is always absorbed in thoughts of material gain, a mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is always absorbed in thoughts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

These symptoms are called bh\u0101va. In The Nectar of Devotion, various bh\u0101vas, ecstatic conditions of a devotee, are fully described. These bh\u0101vas are visible in the activities of a perfect devotee."

        "purport": " Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja sometimes felt that the Lord was far away from him and therefore called Him loudly. When he saw that the Lord was before him, he was fully jubilant. Sometimes, thinking himself one with the Supreme, he imitated the Lord\u2019s pastimes, and in separation from the Lord he would sometimes show symptoms of madness. These feelings of a devotee would not be appreciated by impersonalists. One must go further and further into spiritual understanding. The first realization is impersonal Brahman, but one must go still further to realize Param\u0101tm\u0101 and eventually the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is worshiped by the transcendental feelings of a devotee in a relationship of \u015b\u0101nta, d\u0101sya, sakhya, v\u0101tsalya or m\u0101dhurya. Here the feelings of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja were in the mellow of v\u0101tsalya, filial love and affection. As a child cries when left by his mother, when Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja felt that the Lord was away from him he began to cry (nadati). Again, a devotee like Prahl\u0101da sometimes sees that the Lord is coming from a long distance to pacify him, like a mother responding to a child, saying, \u201cMy dear child, do not cry. I am coming.\u201d Then the devotee, without being ashamed due to his surroundings and circumstances, begins to dance, thinking, \u201cHere is my Lord! My Lord is coming!\u201d Thus the devotee, in full ecstasy, sometimes imitates the pastimes of the Lord, just as the cowherd boys used to imitate the behavior of the jungle animals. However, he does not actually become the Lord. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja achieved the spiritual ecstasies described herein by his advancement in spiritual understanding."

Instead of being disturbed by the torments of his father, Prahl\u0101da influenced these friends and cleansed their minds. A devotee is never contaminated by material conditions, but persons subjected to material conditions can become spiritually advanced and blissful upon seeing the behavior of a pure devotee."
