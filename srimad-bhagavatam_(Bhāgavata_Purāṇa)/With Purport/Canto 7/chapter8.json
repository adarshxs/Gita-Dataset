        "purport": " Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu condemned his Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava son Prahl\u0101da for being durvin\u012bta \u2014 ungentle, uncivilized, or impudent. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura, however, has derived a meaning from this word durvin\u012bta by the mercy of the goddess of learning, Sarasvat\u012b. He says that du\u1e25 refers to this material world. This is confirmed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His instruction in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that this material world is du\u1e25kh\u0101layam, full of material conditions. Vi means vi\u015be\u1e63a, \u201cspecifically,\u201d and n\u012bta means \u201cbrought in.\u201d By the mercy of the Supreme Lord, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was especially brought to this material world to teach people how to get out of the material condition. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, yad\u0101 yad\u0101 hi dharmasya gl\u0101nir bhavati bh\u0101rata. When the entire population, or part of it, becomes forgetful of its own duty, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not present the devotee is present, but the mission is the same: to free the poor conditioned souls from the clutches of the m\u0101y\u0101 that chastises them. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura further explains that the word mand\u0101tman means manda \u2014 very bad or very slow in spiritual realization. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.1.10), mand\u0101\u1e25 sumanda-matayo manda-bh\u0101gy\u0101. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is the guide of all the mandas, or bad living entities who are under the influence of m\u0101y\u0101. He is the benefactor even of the slow and bad living entities in this material world. Kula-bheda-kar\u0101dhama: by his actions, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja made great personalities who established big, big families seem insignificant. Everyone is interested in his own family and in making his dynasty famous, but Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was so liberal that he made no distinction between one living entity and another. Therefore he was greater than the great praj\u0101patis who established their dynasties. The word stabdham means obstinate. A devotee does not care for the instructions of the asuras. When they give instructions, he remains silent. A devotee cares about the instructions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not those of demons or nondevotees. He does not give any respect to a demon, even though the demon be his father. Mac-ch\u0101sanodv\u1e5bttam: Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was disobedient to the orders of his demoniac father. Yama-k\u1e63ayam: every conditioned soul is under the control of Yamar\u0101ja, but Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu said that he considered Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja his deliverer, for Prahl\u0101da would stop Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s repetition of birth and death. Because Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, being a great devotee, was better than any yog\u012b, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was to be brought among the society of bhakti-yog\u012bs. Thus \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura has explained these words in a very interesting way as they can be interpreted from the side of Sarasvat\u012b, the mother of learning."

Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a asked Arjuna to declare that a devotee of the Lord is never vanquished. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was perplexed about how his five-year-old boy could be so fearless that he did not care for the order of his very great and powerful father. A devotee cannot execute the order of anyone except the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the position of a devotee. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu could understand that this boy must have been very powerful, since the boy did not heed his orders. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu asked his son, ki\u1e41 bala\u1e25: \u201cHow have you overcome my order? By whose strength have you done this?\u201d"

Indeed, the original source of all kinds of strength is one. He is not only your strength or mine, but the only strength for everyone. Without Him, no one can get any strength. Whether moving or not moving, superior or inferior, everyone, including Lord Brahm\u0101, is controlled by the strength of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

If one sees extraordinary strength or power anywhere, it is derived from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To give an example, there are different grades of fire, but all of them derive heat and light from the sun. Similarly, all living entities, big or small, are dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One\u2019s only duty is to surrender, for one is a servant and cannot independently attain the position of master. One can attain the position of master only by the mercy of the master, not independently. Unless one understands this philosophy, he is still a m\u016b\u1e0dha; in other words, he is not very intelligent. The m\u016b\u1e0dhas, the asses who do not have this intelligence, cannot surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Understanding the subordinate position of the living entity takes millions of births, but when one is actually wise he surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19): \u201cAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.\u201d Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a great soul, a mah\u0101tm\u0101, and therefore he completely surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord. He was confident that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would give him protection under all circumstances."

If good instructions are given to a foolish person, he does not take advantage of them, but becomes more and more angry. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s authorized instructions to his father were not accepted by Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu as truth; instead Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu became increasingly angry at his great son, who was a pure devotee. This kind of difficulty always exists when a devotee preaches K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to persons like Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, who are interested in money and women. (The word hira\u1e47ya means \u201cgold,\u201d and ka\u015bipu refers to cushions or good bedding.) Moreover, a father does not like to be instructed by his son, especially if the father is a demon. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava preaching to his demoniac father was indirectly effective, for because of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s excessive jealousy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His devotee, he was inviting N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva to kill him very quickly. Thus he was expediting his being killed by the Lord Himself. Although Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was a demon, he is described here by the added word \u015br\u012b. Why? The answer is that fortunately he had such a great devotee son as Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Thus although he was a demon, he would attain salvation and return home, back to Godhead."

        "purport": " Demons sometimes declare to a devotee that they cannot accept the existence of God because they cannot see Him. But what the demon does not know is stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.25): n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sarvasya yoga-m\u0101y\u0101-sam\u0101v\u1e5bta\u1e25. \u201cI am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by yoga-m\u0101y\u0101.\u201d The Lord is open to being seen by devotees, but nondevotees cannot see Him. The qualification for seeing God is stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38): prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa\u1e25 sadaiva h\u1e5bdaye\u1e63u vilokayanti. A devotee who has developed a genuine love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can always see Him everywhere, whereas a demon, not having a clear understanding of the Supreme Lord, cannot see Him. When Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was threatening to kill Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, Prahl\u0101da certainly saw the column standing before him and his father, and he saw that the Lord was present in the pillar to encourage him not to fear his demoniac father\u2019s words. The Lord was present to protect him. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu marked Prahl\u0101da\u2019s observation and asked him, \u201cWhere is your God?\u201d Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja replied, \u201cHe is everywhere.\u201d Then Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu asked, \u201cWhy is He not in this pillar before me?\u201d Thus in all circumstances the devotee can always see the Supreme Lord, whereas the nondevotee cannot. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja has here been addressed by his father as \u201cthe most unfortunate.\u201d Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu thought himself extremely fortunate because he possessed the property of the universe. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, his legitimate son, was to have inherited this vast property, but because of his impudence, he was going to die at his father\u2019s hands. Therefore the demoniac father considered Prahl\u0101da the most unfortunate because Prahl\u0101da would not be able to inherit his property. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu did not know that Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the most fortunate person within the three worlds because Prahl\u0101da was protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such are the misunderstandings of demons. They do not know that a devotee is protected by the Lord in all circumstances (kaunteya pratij\u0101n\u012bhi na me bhakta\u1e25 pra\u1e47a\u015byati)."

His neck was very short and thick, His chest broad, His waist thin, and the hairs on His body as white as the rays of the moon.

This is not at all astonishing, for the Lord is always situated in pure goodness. Formerly, during creation, He entered the dark universe and illuminated it by His spiritual effulgence.",
        "purport": " The Lord is situated transcendentally, in pure goodness. The material world is generally controlled by tamo-gu\u1e47a, the quality of ignorance, but the spiritual world, because of the presence of the Lord and His effulgence, is free from all contamination by darkness, passion or contaminated goodness. Although there is a tinge of goodness in this material world in terms of the brahminical qualifications, such qualifications sometimes become invisible because of the strong prevalence of the modes of passion and ignorance. But because the Lord is always transcendentally situated, the material modes of passion and ignorance cannot touch Him. Whenever the Lord is present, there cannot be any darkness from the mode of ignorance. It is stated in Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.31): \u201cGodhead is light. Nescience is darkness. Where there is Godhead there is no nescience.\u201d This material world is full of darkness and ignorance of spiritual life, but by bhakti-yoga this ignorance is dissipated. The Lord appeared because of the bhakti-yoga exhibited by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and as soon as the Lord appeared, the influence of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s passion and ignorance was vanquished as the Lord\u2019s quality of pure goodness, or the Brahman effulgence, became prominent. In that prominent effulgence, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu became invisible, or his influence became insignificant. An example illustrating how the darkness of the material world is vanquished is given in the \u015b\u0101stra. When Brahm\u0101 was created from the lotus stem growing from the abdomen of Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Lord Brahm\u0101 saw everything to be dark, but when he received knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything became clear, as everything becomes clear when one comes from night to sunshine. The important point is that as long as we are in the material modes of nature, we are always in darkness. This darkness cannot be dissipated without the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is invoked by the practice of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga creates a transcendental situation with no tinges of material contamination."

Therefore, just to keep the word of Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva pierced Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s body with His nails, which were not weapons and were neither living nor dead. Indeed, the nails can be called dead, but at the same time they can be said to be alive. To keep intact all of Lord Brahm\u0101\u2019s benedictions, Lord N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva paradoxically but very easily killed the great demon Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu."

They are trying to prove that there is no God and that everything takes place due to combinations and permutations of material elements. Thus the material world is becoming more and more godless, and consequently everything is in a disturbed condition.

Because of fear and obedience, no one could come forward to serve the Lord directly.",
        "purport": " When the Lord sat on the throne of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, there was no one to protest; no enemy came forward on behalf of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu to fight with the Lord. This means that His supremacy was immediately accepted by the demons. Another point is that although Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu treated the Lord as his bitterest enemy, he was the Lord\u2019s faithful servant in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, and therefore the Lord had no hesitation in sitting on the throne that Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu had so laboriously created. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks in this connection that sometimes, with great care and attention, great saintly persons and \u1e5b\u1e63is offer the Lord valuable seats dedicated with Vedic mantras and tantras, but still the Lord does not sit upon those thrones. Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, however, had formerly been Jaya, the doorkeeper at the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha gate, and although he had fallen because of the curse of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and had gotten the nature of a demon, and although he had never offered anything to the Lord as Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, the Lord is so affectionate to His devotee and servant that He nonetheless took pleasure in sitting on the throne that Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu had created. In this regard it is to be understood that a devotee is fortunate in any condition of his life."

When Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was killed, all the demigods, who had always been disturbed by Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, felt relief in their general way of life. Because the government in Kali-yuga is full of demons, the living conditions of devotees are always disturbed. Devotees cannot perform yaj\u00f1a, and thus they cannot partake of the remnants of food offered in yaj\u00f1a for the worship of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The hearts of the demigods are always filled with fear of the demons, and therefore they cannot think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The engagement of the demigods is to think of the Lord always within the cores of their hearts. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.47): \u201cAnd of all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\u201d The demigods fully absorb themselves in meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead to become perfect yog\u012bs, but because of the presence of demons, their hearts are filled with the activities of the demons. Thus their hearts, which are meant to be the abode of the Supreme Lord, are practically occupied by the demons. All the demigods felt relieved when Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was dead, for they could easily think of the Lord. They could then receive the results of sacrifices and become happy even though in the material world."

O Lord, now that You have killed this great demon, we are in our normal condition. Kindly order us, Your eternal servants, what to do now.",
        "purport": " In many places in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, refers to the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma of four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas. He teaches people about this var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma so that all of human society can live peacefully by observing the principles for the four social divisions and four spiritual divisions (var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama) and thus make advancement in spiritual knowledge. The Manus compiled the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. The word sa\u1e41hit\u0101 means Vedic knowledge, and manu indicates that this knowledge is given by Manu. The Manus are sometimes incarnations of the Supreme Lord and sometimes empowered living entities. Formerly, many long years ago, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructed the sun-god. The Manus are generally sons of the sun-god. Therefore, while speaking to Arjuna about the importance of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said, ima\u1e41 vivasvate yoga\u1e41 proktav\u0101n aham avyayam vivasv\u0101n manave pr\u0101ha: \u201cThis instruction was given to Vivasv\u0101n, the sun-god, who in turn instructed his son Manu.\u201d Manu gave the law known as Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, which is full of directions based on var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama concerning how to live as a human being. These are very scientific ways of life, but under the rule of demons like Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, human society breaks all these systems of law and order and gradually becomes lower and lower. Thus there is no peace in the world. The conclusion is that if we want real peace and order in the human society, we must follow the principles laid down by the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

O Lord, we can understand that Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was the same Jaya who engaged in Your service but was cursed by br\u0101hma\u1e47as and who thus received the body of a demon. We understand that his having now been killed is Your special mercy upon him.",
        "purport": " Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu\u2019s coming to this earth and acting as the Lord\u2019s enemy was prearranged. Jaya and Vijaya were cursed by the br\u0101hma\u1e47as Sanaka, Sanat-kum\u0101ra, Sanandana and San\u0101tana because Jaya and Vijaya checked these four Kum\u0101ras. The Lord accepted this cursing of His servants and agreed that they would have to go to the material world and would then return to Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha after serving the term of the curse. Jaya and Vijaya were very much perturbed, but the Lord advised them to act as enemies, for then they would return after three births; otherwise, ordinarily, they would have to take seven births. With this authority, Jaya and Vijaya acted as the Lord\u2019s enemies, and now that these two were dead, all the Vi\u1e63\u1e47ud\u016btas understood that the Lord\u2019s killing of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu was special mercy bestowed upon them."
