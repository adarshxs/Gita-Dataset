We have several times explained what the eternal occupational duty of the living being is. Indeed, it has been explained by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. J\u012bvera\u00a0\u2018svar\u016bpa\u2019 haya \u2014 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47era\u00a0\u2018nitya-d\u0101sa\u2019: the real occupational duty of the living entity is to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even if one prefers to deviate from this principle he remains a servant because that is his eternal position; but one serves m\u0101y\u0101, the illusory, material energy. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, therefore, is an attempt to guide human society to serving the Personality of Godhead instead of serving the material world with no real profit. Our actual experience is that every man, animal, bird and beast \u2014 indeed, every living entity \u2014 is engaged in rendering service. Even though one\u2019s body or one\u2019s superficial religion may change, every living entity is always engaged in the service of someone. Therefore, the mentality of service is called the eternal occupational duty. This eternal occupational duty can be organized through the institution of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama, in which there are four var\u1e47as (br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra) and four \u0101\u015bramas (brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa). Thus, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira Mah\u0101r\u0101ja inquired from N\u0101rada Muni about the principles of san\u0101tana-dharma for the benefit of human society."

N\u0101rada Muni received instructions from Lord Brahm\u0101 and in turn transmitted the instructions to Vy\u0101sadeva.

O King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, this principle of religion is to be understood as evidence. On the basis of this religious principle, everything is satisfied, including one\u2019s mind, soul and even one\u2019s body.",
        "purport": " As stated by Yamar\u0101ja, dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam. Yamar\u0101ja, the representative of the Lord who takes care of the living beings after their death, gives his verdict as to how and when the living being will change his body. He is the authority, and he says that the religious principles consist of the codes and laws given by God. No one can manufacture religion, and therefore manufactured religious systems are rejected by the followers of the Vedic principles. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15) it is said, vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25: Vedic knowledge means to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, whether one speaks of the Vedas, scriptures, religion or the principles of everyone\u2019s occupational duty, all of them must aim at understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.6) therefore concludes: In other words, religious principles aim at learning how to render transcendental loving service to the Lord. That service must be unmotivated and unchecked by material conditions. Then human society will be happy in all respects. The sm\u1e5bti, the scriptures following the principles of Vedic knowledge, are considered the evidence of Vedic principles. There are twenty different types of scripture for following religious principles, and among them the scriptures of Manu and Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya are considered to be all-pervading authorities. In the Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya-sm\u1e5bti it is said: One should learn human behavior from \u015bruti, the Vedas, and from sm\u1e5bti, the scriptures following the Vedic principles. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu says: The purport is that to become a devotee one must follow the principles laid down in \u015bruti and sm\u1e5bti. One must follow the codes of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and the p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b-vidhi. One cannot be a pure devotee without following the \u015bruti and sm\u1e5bti, and the \u015bruti and sm\u1e5bti without devotional service cannot lead one to the perfection of life. Therefore, from all the evidence the conclusion is that without bhakti, devotional service, there is no question of religious principles. God is the central figure in the performance of religious principles. Almost everything going on in this world as religion is devoid of any idea of devotional service and is therefore condemned by the verdict of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Without devotional service, so-called religious principles are only cheating."

O King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, these thirty qualifications must be acquired in the human form of life. Simply by acquiring these qualifications, one can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",
        "purport": " In order that human beings be distinct from the animals, the great saint N\u0101rada recommends that every human being be educated in terms of the above-mentioned thirty qualifications. Nowadays there is propaganda everywhere, all over the world, for a secular state, a state interested only in mundane activities. But if the citizens of the state are not educated in the above-mentioned good qualities, how can there be happiness? For example, if the total populace is untruthful, how can the state be happy? Therefore, without consideration of one\u2019s belonging to a sectarian religion, whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or any other sect, everyone should be taught to become truthful. Similarly, everyone should be taught to be merciful, and everyone should observe fasting on certain days of the month. Everyone should bathe twice a day, cleanse his teeth and body externally, and cleanse his mind internally by remembering the holy name of the Lord. The Lord is one, whether one is Hindu, Muslim or Christian. Therefore, one should chant the holy name of the Lord, regardless of differences in linguistic pronunciation. Also, everyone should be taught to be very careful not to discharge semen unnecessarily. This is very important for all human beings. If semen is not discharged unnecessarily, one becomes extremely strong in memory, determination, activity and the vitality of one\u2019s bodily energy. Everyone should also be taught to be simple in thought and feeling and satisfied in body and mind. These are the general qualifications of a human being. There is no question of a secular state or an ecclesiastical state. Unless one is educated in the above-mentioned thirty qualities, there cannot be any peace. Ultimately it is recommended: Everyone should become a devotee of the Lord, because by becoming a devotee of the Lord one automatically acquires the other qualities. \u201cIn one who has unflinching devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, all the good qualities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the demigods are consistently manifest. However, he who has no devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no good qualifications because he is engaged by mental concoction in material existence, which is the external feature of the Lord.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.18.12) Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, therefore, is all-embracing. Human civilization should take it very seriously and practice its principles for the peace of the world."

Such br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas, purified by their family traditions and by their behavior, should worship the Lord, study the Vedas and give charity. In this system, they should follow the principles of the four \u0101\u015bramas [brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa].",
        "purport": " After giving a general list of thirty qualifications for one\u2019s behavior, N\u0101rada Muni now describes the principles of the four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas. A human being must be trained in the above-mentioned thirty qualities; otherwise, he is not even a human being. Then, among such qualified persons, the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama process should be introduced. In the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system, the first ceremony for purification is garbh\u0101dh\u0101na, which is performed with mantras at the time of sex for propagating a good child. One who uses sex life not for sensual pleasures but only to beget children according to the reformatory method is also accepted as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b. One should not waste semen on sensual pleasure, violating the principles of Vedic life. Restraint in sex is possible, however, only when the populace is trained in the above-mentioned thirty qualities; otherwise, it is not possible. Even if one is born in a family of dvijas, or twice-born, if they have not followed the reformatory process he is called a dvija-bandhu \u2014 not one of the twice-born, but a friend of the twice-born. The whole purpose of this system is to create good population. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, when women are polluted the populace is var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara, and when the var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara population increases, the situation of the entire world becomes hellish. Therefore, all the Vedic literatures strongly warn against creating var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara population. When there is var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara population, the people cannot be properly controlled for peace and prosperity, regardless of great legislative assemblies, parliaments and similar bodies."

Br\u0101hma\u1e47as have six occupational duties, of which three are compulsory \u2014 namely, studying the Vedas, worshiping the Deity and giving charity. By teaching, by inducing others to worship the Deity, and by accepting gifts, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as receive the necessities of life. This is also confirmed in the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: Of the six occupational duties of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, three are compulsory \u2014 namely, worship of the Deity, study of the Vedas and the giving of charity. In exchange, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a should receive charity, and this should be his means of livelihood. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a cannot take up any professional occupational duty for his livelihood. The \u015b\u0101stras especially stress that if one claims to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he cannot engage in the service of anyone else; otherwise he at once falls from his position and becomes a \u015b\u016bdra. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b and San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b belonged to a very respectful family, but because they engaged in the service of Nawab Hussain Shah \u2014 not even as ordinary clerks, but as ministers \u2014 they were ostracized from brahminical society. Indeed, they became like Mohammedans and even changed their names. Unless a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is very pure, he cannot accept charity from others. Charity should be given to those who are pure. Even if one is born in a family of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, if one acts as a \u015b\u016bdra one cannot accept charity, for this is strictly prohibited. Although the k\u1e63atriyas are almost as qualified as the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, even they cannot accept charity. This is strictly prohibited in this verse by the word apratigraha. What to speak of the lower social orders, even the k\u1e63atriyas must not accept charity. The king or government may levy taxes upon the citizens in various ways \u2014 by revenue duties, customs duties, realization of fines, and so on \u2014 provided the king is able to give full protection to his subjects to assure the security of their life and property. Unless he is able to give protection, he cannot levy taxes. However, a king must not levy any tax upon the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas fully engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Even a k\u1e63atriya cannot accept the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a unless there is an emergency, and then even if he does so he should not accept charity from anyone else. Sometimes br\u0101hma\u1e47as protest against our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement for creating br\u0101hma\u1e47as from Europeans, or, in other words, from mlecchas and yavanas. This movement, however, is here supported in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. At the present moment, society is in a chaotic condition, and everyone has given up the cultivation of spiritual life, which is especially meant for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Because spiritual culture has been stopped all over the world, there is now an emergency, and therefore it is now time to train those who are considered lower and condemned, so that they may become br\u0101hma\u1e47as and take up the work of spiritual progress. The spiritual progress of human society has been stopped, and this should be considered an emergency. Here is solid support from N\u0101rada Muni of the movement known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

        "purport": " It is very important for peaceful householder life that a woman follow the vow of her husband. Any disagreement with the husband\u2019s vow will disrupt family life. In this regard, C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita gives a very valuable instruction: dampatyo\u1e25 kalaho n\u0101sti tatra \u015br\u012b\u1e25 svayam \u0101gat\u0101\u1e25. When there are no fights between husband and wife, the goddess of fortune automatically comes to the home. A woman\u2019s education should be conducted along the lines indicated in this verse. The basic principle for a chaste woman is to be always favorably disposed toward her husband. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (1.40) it is said, str\u012b\u1e63u du\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101su v\u0101r\u1e63\u1e47eya j\u0101yate var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara\u1e25: if the women are polluted, there will be var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara population. In modern terms, the var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara are the hippies, who do not follow any regulative injunctions. Another explanation is that when the population is var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara, no one can know who is on what platform. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama system scientifically divides society into four var\u1e47as and four \u0101\u015bramas, but in var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara society there are no such distinctions, and no one can know who is who. In such a society, no one can distinguish between a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a k\u1e63atriya, a vai\u015bya and a \u015b\u016bdra. For peace and happiness in the material world, the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution must be introduced. The symptoms of one\u2019s activities must be defined, and one must be educated accordingly. Then spiritual advancement will automatically be possible."

She should speak pleasingly and truthfully and should be very careful and always clean and pure. Thus a chaste woman should engage with affection in the service of a husband who is not fallen.",
        "purport": " According to the injunction of Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya, an authority on religious principles, \u0101\u015buddhe\u1e25 sampratik\u1e63yo hi mah\u0101p\u0101taka-d\u016b\u1e63ita\u1e25. One is considered contaminated by the reactions of great sinful activities when one has not been purified according to the methods of the da\u015ba-vidh\u0101-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, however, the Lord says, na m\u0101\u1e41 du\u1e63k\u1e5btino m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante nar\u0101dham\u0101\u1e25: \u201cThose miscreants who do not surrender unto Me are the lowest of mankind.\u201d The word nar\u0101dhama means \u201cnondevotee.\u201d \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu also said, yei bhaje sei ba\u1e0da, abhakta \u2014 h\u012bna, ch\u0101ra. Anyone who is a devotee is sinless. One who is not a devotee, however, is the most fallen and condemned. It is recommended, therefore, that a chaste wife not associate with a fallen husband. A fallen husband is one who is addicted to the four principles of sinful activity \u2014 namely illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Specifically, if one is not a soul surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is understood to be contaminated. Thus a chaste woman is advised not to agree to serve such a husband. It is not that a chaste woman should be like a slave while her husband is nar\u0101dhama, the lowest of men. Although the duties of a woman are different from those of a man, a chaste woman is not meant to serve a fallen husband. If her husband is fallen, it is recommended that she give up his association. Giving up the association of her husband does not mean, however, that a woman should marry again and thus indulge in prostitution. If a chaste woman unfortunately marries a husband who is fallen, she should live separately from him. Similarly, a husband can separate himself from a woman who is not chaste according to the description of the \u015b\u0101stra. The conclusion is that a husband should be a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava and that a woman should be a chaste wife with all the symptoms described in this regard. Then both of them will be happy and make spiritual progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

In the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped by many, many thousands of goddesses of fortune, and in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshiped by many, many thousands of gop\u012bs, all of whom are goddesses of fortune. A woman should serve her husband as faithfully as the goddess of fortune. A man should be an ideal servant of the Lord, and a woman should be an ideal wife like the goddess of fortune. Then both husband and wife will be so faithful and strong that by acting together they will return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya gives this opinion: A woman should think of her husband as the Supreme Lord. Similarly, a disciple should think of the spiritual master as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a \u015b\u016bdra should think of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a servant should think of his master as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this way, all of them will automatically become devotees of the Lord. In other words, by thinking this way, all of them will become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious."

As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13), c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25.

If one was born in a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family and has acquired the brahminical qualifications, he is to be accepted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a; otherwise, he should be considered a brahma-bandhu. Similarly, if a \u015b\u016bdra acquires the qualities of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although he was born in a \u015b\u016bdra family, he is not a \u015b\u016bdra; because he has developed the qualities of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he should be accepted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is meant to develop these brahminical qualities. Regardless of the community in which one was born, if one develops the qualities of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a he should be accepted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and he then may be offered the order of sanny\u0101sa. Unless one is qualified in terms of the brahminical symptoms, one cannot take sanny\u0101sa. In designating a person a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra, birth is not the essential symptom. This understanding is very important. Herein N\u0101rada Muni distinctly says that one may be accepted according to the caste of his birth if he has the corresponding qualifications, but otherwise he should not. One who has attained the qualifications of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, regardless of where he was born, should be accepted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Similarly, if one has developed the qualities of a \u015b\u016bdra or a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la, regardless of where he was born, he should be accepted in terms of those symptoms."
