The human body is most rarely achieved, and although temporary like other bodies, it is meaningful because in human life one can perform devotional service. Even a slight amount of sincere devotional service can give one complete perfection.",
        "purport": " The whole purpose of Vedic civilization and of reading the Vedas is to attain the perfect stage of devotional service in the human form of life. According to the Vedic system, therefore, from the very beginning of life the brahmacarya system is introduced so that from one\u2019s very childhood \u2014 from the age of five years \u2014 one can practice modifying one\u2019s human activities so as to engage perfectly in devotional service. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.40), svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t: \u201cEven a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.\u201d Modern civilization, not referring to the verdicts of Vedic literature, is so cruel to the members of human society that instead of teaching children to become brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, it teaches mothers to kill their children even in the womb, on the plea of curbing the increase of population. And if by chance a child is saved, he is educated only for sense gratification. Gradually, throughout the entire world, human society is losing interest in the perfection of life. Indeed, men are living like cats and dogs, spoiling the duration of their human lives by actually preparing to transmigrate again to the degraded species among the 8,400,000 forms of life. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is anxious to serve human society by teaching people to perform devotional service, which can save a human being from being degraded again to animal life. As already stated by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, bh\u0101gavata-dharma consists of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smara\u1e47a\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam/ arcana\u1e41 vandana\u1e41 d\u0101sya\u1e41 sakhyam \u0101tma-nivedanam. In all the schools, colleges and universities, and at home, all children and youths should be taught to hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, they should be taught to hear the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, to put them into practice in their lives, and thus to become strong in devotional service, free from fear of being degraded to animal life. Following bh\u0101gavata-dharma has been made extremely easy in this Age of Kali. The \u015b\u0101stra says: One need only chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra. Everyone engaged in the practice of chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra will be completely cleansed, from the core of his heart, and be saved from the cycle of birth and death."

This devotional service is natural because Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the most beloved, the master of the soul, and the well-wisher of all other living beings.",
        "purport": " The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (5.29): \u201cThe sage who knows Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.\u201d Simply by understanding these three facts \u2014 that the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is the proprietor of the entire creation, that He is the best well-wishing friend of all living entities, and that He is the supreme enjoyer of everything \u2014 one becomes peaceful and happy. For this transcendental happiness, the living entity has wandered throughout the universe in different forms of life and different planetary systems, but because he has forgotten his intimate relationship with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he has merely suffered, life after life. Therefore, the educational system in the human form of life should be so perfect that one will understand his intimate relationship with God, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Every living entity has an intimate relationship with God. One should therefore glorify the Lord in the adoration of \u015b\u0101nta-rasa or revive his eternal relationship with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as a servant in d\u0101sya-rasa, a friend in sakhya-rasa, a parent in v\u0101tsalya-rasa or a conjugal lover in m\u0101dhurya-rasa. All these relationships are on the platform of love. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the center of love for everyone, and therefore the duty of everyone is to engage in the loving service of the Lord.

Our eternal relationship with God can be revived in the human form of life, and that should be the goal of education. Indeed, that is the perfection of life and the perfection of education."

        "purport": " As stated by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja at the beginning of this chapter, kaum\u0101ra \u0101caret pr\u0101j\u00f1a\u1e25. The word pr\u0101j\u00f1a refers to one who is experienced and who can distinguish right from wrong. Such a person should not waste his energy and valuable human lifetime simply working like a cat or dog to develop his economic condition. For one word in this verse there are two readings \u2014 bhavam \u0101\u015brita\u1e25 and bhayam \u0101\u015brita\u1e25 \u2014 but accepting the meaning of either of them will bring one to the same conclusion. Bhayam \u0101\u015brita\u1e25 indicates that the materialistic way of life is always fearful because at every step there is danger. Materialistic life is full of anxieties and fear (bhayam). Similarly, accepting the reading bhavam \u0101\u015brita\u1e25, the word bhavam refers to unnecessary trouble and problems. For want of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one is put into bhavam, being perpetually embarrassed by birth, death, old age and disease. Thus one is surely full of anxieties. Human society should be divided into a social system of br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras, but everyone can engage in devotional service. If one wants to live without devotional service, his status as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya or \u015b\u016bdra certainly has no meaning. It is said, sth\u0101n\u0101d bhra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25 patanty adha\u1e25: whether one is in a higher or lower division, one certainly falls down for want of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A sane man, therefore, is always fearful of falling from his position. This is a regulative principle. One should not fall from his exalted position. The highest goal of life can be achieved as long as one\u2019s body is stout and strong. We should therefore live in such a way that we keep ourselves always healthy and strong in mind and intelligence so that we can distinguish the goal of life from a life full of problems. A thoughtful man must act in this way, learning to distinguish right from wrong, and thus attain the goal of life."

This world is a relative world, and its relative moments of time are different. Thus the one hundred years of Brahm\u0101 are not the same as the one hundred years of a human being. From Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we understand that Brahm\u0101\u2019s daytime of twelve hours equals 4,300,000 times 1,000 years (sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahma\u1e47o vidu\u1e25). Thus the var\u1e63a-\u015batam, or one hundred years, are relatively different according to time, person and circumstances. As far as human beings are concerned, the calculation given here is right for the general public. Although one has a maximum of one hundred years of life, by sleeping one loses fifty years. Eating, sleeping, sex life and fear are the four bodily necessities, but to utilize the full duration of life a person desiring to advance in spiritual consciousness must reduce these activities. That will give him an opportunity to fully use his lifetime."

This leaves only a few more years, but because of too much attachment to household life, those years are also spent with no purpose, without God consciousness. Therefore, one should be trained to be a perfect brahmac\u0101r\u012b in the beginning of life and then to be perfect in sense control, following the regulative principles, if one becomes a householder. From household life one is ordered to accept v\u0101naprastha life and go to the forest and then accept sanny\u0101sa. That is the perfection of life. From the very beginning of life, those who are ajitendriya, who cannot control their senses, are educated only for sense gratification, as we have seen in the Western countries. Thus the entire duration of a life of even one hundred years is wasted and misused, and at the time of death one transmigrates to another body, which may not be human. At the end of one hundred years, one who has not acted as a human being in a life of tapasya (austerity and penance) must certainly be embodied again in a body like those of cats, dogs and hogs. Therefore this life of lusty desires and sense gratification is extremely risky."

For this purpose K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a personally advises, sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: \u201cGive up all other duties and surrender unto Me.\u201d While in the material world we manufacture so many duties in the name of so many isms, but our actual duty is to free ourselves from the cycle of birth, death, old age and disease. For this purpose, one must first be liberated from material bondage, and especially from household life. Household life is actually a kind of license for a materially attached person by which to enjoy sense gratification under regulative principles. Otherwise there is no need of entering household life. Before entering household life, one should be trained as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, living under the care of the guru, whose place is known as the gurukula. Brahmac\u0101r\u012b gurukule vasan d\u0101nto guror hitam (Bh\u0101g. 7.12.1). From the very beginning, a brahmac\u0101r\u012b is trained to sacrifice everything for the benefit of the guru. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b is advised to go begging alms door to door, addressing all women as mother, and whatever he collects goes to the benefit of the guru. In this way he learns how to control his senses and sacrifice everything for the guru. When he is fully trained, if he likes he is allowed to marry. Thus he is not an ordinary g\u1e5bhastha who has learned only how to satisfy his senses. A trained g\u1e5bhastha can gradually give up household life and go to the forest to become increasingly enlightened in spiritual life and at last take sanny\u0101sa. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja explained to his father that to be freed from all material anxieties one should go to the forest. Hitv\u0101tma-p\u0101ta\u1e41 g\u1e5bham andha-k\u016bpam. One should give up his household, which is a place for going further and further down into the darkest regions of material existence. The first advice, therefore, is that one must give up household life (g\u1e5bham andha-k\u016bpam). However, if one prefers to remain in the dark well of household life because of uncontrolled senses, he becomes increasingly entangled by ropes of affection for his wife, children, servants, house, money and so on. Such a person cannot attain liberation from material bondage. Therefore children should be taught from the very beginning of life to be first-class brahmac\u0101r\u012bs. Then it will be possible for them to give up household life in the future. To return home, back to Godhead, one must be completely free from material attachment. Therefore, bhakti-yoga means vair\u0101gya-vidy\u0101, the art that can help one develop a distaste for material enjoyment. \u201cBy rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.7) If one engages in devotional service from the beginning of life, he easily attains vair\u0101gya-vidy\u0101, or asakti, detachment, and becomes jitendriya, the controller of his senses. One who perfectly engages in devotional service is therefore called gosv\u0101m\u012b or sv\u0101m\u012b, master of the senses. Unless one is master of the senses, he should not accept the renounced order of life, sanny\u0101sa. A strong inclination for sense enjoyment is the cause of the material body. Without full knowledge one cannot be unattached to material enjoyment, but as long as one is not in that position one is not fit to return home, back to Godhead."

Because of trespassing, they may be killed by guns or attacked by watchdogs, but still they try to commit burglary. Why do they risk their lives? Only to get some money. Similarly, a professional soldier is recruited into the army, and he accepts such service, with the risk of dying on the battlefield, only for the sake of money. In the same way, merchants go from one country to another on boats at the risk of their lives, or they dive into the water of the sea to collect pearls and valuable gems. Thus it is practically proved \u2014 and everyone will admit \u2014 that money is sweeter than honey. One may risk everything to acquire money, and this is especially true of rich men who are too attached to household life. Formerly, of course, the members of the higher castes \u2014 the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas (everyone but the \u015b\u016bdras) \u2014 were trained in the gurukula to adhere to a life of renunciation and sense control by practicing brahmacarya and mystic yoga. Then they were allowed to enter household life. There have consequently been many instances in which great kings and emperors have given up household life. Although they were extremely opulent and were the masters of kingdoms, they could give up all their possessions because they were trained early as brahmac\u0101r\u012bs. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s advice is therefore very appropriate: \u201cOne who is sufficiently intelligent should use the human form of body from the very beginning of life \u2014 in other words, from the tender age of childhood \u2014 to practice the activities of devotional service, giving up all other engagements. The human body is most rarely achieved, and although temporary like other bodies, it is meaningful because in human life one can perform devotional service. Even a slight amount of sincere devotional service can give one complete perfection.\u201d Human society should take advantage of this instruction."

Specifically, a wife is always very kind and sympathetic and always pleases her husband in a solitary place. Who could give up the association of such a dear and affectionate wife? Small children talk in broken language, very pleasing to hear, and their affectionate father always thinks of their sweet words. How could he give up their association? One\u2019s elderly parents and one\u2019s sons and daughters are also very dear. A daughter is especially dear to her father, and while living at her husband\u2019s house she is always in his mind. Who could give up that association? Aside from this, in household affairs there are many decorated items of household furniture, and there are also animals and servants. Who could give up such comforts? The attached householder is like a silkworm, which weaves a cocoon in which it becomes imprisoned, unable to get out. Simply for the satisfaction of two important senses \u2014 the genitals and the tongue \u2014 one is bound by material conditions. How can one escape?",
        "purport": " In household affairs the first attraction is the beautiful and pleasing wife, who increases household attraction more and more. One enjoys his wife with two prominent sense organs, namely the tongue and the genitals. The wife speaks very sweetly. This is certainly an attraction. Then she prepares very palatable foods to satisfy the tongue, and when the tongue is satisfied one gains strength in the other sense organs, especially the genitals. Thus the wife gives pleasure in sexual intercourse. Household life means sex life (yan maithun\u0101di-g\u1e5bhamedhi-sukha\u1e41 hi tuccham). This is encouraged by the tongue. Then there are children. A baby gives pleasure by speaking sweet words in broken language, and when the sons and daughters are grown up one becomes involved in their education and marriage. Then there are one\u2019s own father and mother to be taken care of, and one also becomes concerned with the social atmosphere and with pleasing his brothers and sisters. A man becomes increasingly entangled in household affairs, so much so that leaving them becomes almost impossible. Thus the household becomes g\u1e5bham andha-k\u016bpam, a dark well into which the man has fallen. For such a man to get out is extremely difficult unless he is helped by a strong person, the spiritual master, who helps the fallen person with the strong rope of spiritual instructions. A fallen person should take advantage of this rope, and then the spiritual master, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, will take him out of the dark well."

He is expert in calculating the loss of pounds, shillings and pence, but he is so foolish that he does not know how much money he is losing, even according to material considerations. C\u0101\u1e47akya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita gives the example that a moment of life cannot be purchased in exchange for millions of dollars. A foolish person, however, wastes such a valuable life without knowing how much he is losing, even according to monetary calculations. Although a materialistic person is expert in calculating costs and doing business, he does not realize that he is misusing his costly life for want of knowledge. Even though such a materialistic person is always suffering threefold miseries, he is not intelligent enough to cease his materialistic way of life."

        "translation": "O my friends, sons of demons! In this material world, even those who are apparently advanced in education have the propensity to consider, \u201cThis is mine, and that is for others.\u201d Thus they are always engaged in providing the necessities of life to their families in a limited conception of family life, just like uneducated cats and dogs. They are unable to take to spiritual knowledge; instead, they are bewildered and overcome by ignorance.",
        "purport": " In human society there are attempts to educate the human being, but for animal society there is no such system, nor are animals able to be educated. Therefore animals and unintelligent men are called vim\u016b\u1e0dha, or ignorant, bewildered, whereas an educated person is called vidv\u0101n. The real vidv\u0101n is one who tries to understand his own position within this material world. For example, when San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b submitted to the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, his first question was \u2018ke \u0101mi,\u2019\u00a0\u2018kene \u0101m\u0101ya j\u0101re t\u0101pa-traya.\u2019 In other words, he wanted to know his constitutional position and why he was suffering from the threefold miseries of material existence. This is the process of education. If one does not ask, \u201cWho am I? What is the goal of my life?\u201d but instead follows the same animal propensities as cats and dogs, what is the use of his education? As discussed in the previous verse, a living being is entrapped by his fruitive activities, exactly like a silkworm trapped in its own cocoon. Foolish persons are generally encaged by their fruitive actions (karma) because of a strong desire to enjoy this material world. Such attracted persons become involved in society, community and nation and waste their time, not having profited from having obtained human forms. Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, great leaders, politicians, philosophers and scientists are all engaged in foolish activities, thinking, \u201cThis is mine, and this is yours.\u201d The scientists invent nuclear weapons and collaborate with the big leaders to protect the interests of their own nation or society. In this verse, however, it is clearly stated that despite their so-called advanced knowledge, they actually have the same mentality as cats and dogs. As cats, dogs and other animals, not knowing their true interest in life, become increasingly involved in ignorance, the so-called educated person who does not know his own self-interest or the true goal of life becomes increasingly involved in materialism. Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja advises everyone to follow the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. Specifically, at a certain point one must give up family life and take to the renounced order of life to cultivate spiritual knowledge and thus become liberated. This is further discussed in the following verses."

        "translation": "My dear friends, O sons of the demons, it is certain that no one bereft of knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been able to liberate himself from material bondage at any time or in any country. Rather, those bereft of knowledge of the Lord are bound by the material laws. They are factually addicted to sense gratification, and their target is woman. Indeed, they are actually playthings in the hands of attractive women. Victimized by such a conception of life, they become surrounded by children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and thus they are shackled to material bondage. Those who are very much addicted to this conception of life are called demons. Therefore, although you are sons of demons, keep aloof from such persons and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the origin of all the demigods, because the ultimate goal for the devotees of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is liberation from the bondage of material existence.",
        "purport": " Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja has maintained the philosophical point of view that one should give up the dark well of family life and go to the forest to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (hitv\u0101tma-p\u0101ta\u1e41 g\u1e5bham andha-k\u016bpa\u1e41 vana\u1e41 gato yad dharim \u0101\u015brayeta). In this verse also, he stresses the same point. In the history of human society, no one, at any time or any place, has been liberated because of too much affection and attachment for his family. Even in those who are apparently very educated, the same family attachment is there. They cannot give up the association of their families, even in old age or invalidity, for they are attached to sense enjoyment. As we have several times discussed, yan maithun\u0101di-g\u1e5bhamedhi-sukha\u1e41 hi tuccham: so-called householders are simply attracted by sexual enjoyment. Thus they keep themselves shackled in family life, and furthermore they want their children to be shackled in the same way. Playing the parts of playboys in the hands of women, they glide down to the darkest regions of material existence. Ad\u0101nta-gobhir vi\u015bat\u0101\u1e41 tamisra\u1e41 puna\u1e25 puna\u015b carvita-carva\u1e47\u0101n\u0101m. Because they are unable to control their senses, they continue a life of chewing the chewed and therefore descend to the darkest material regions. One should give up the association of such demons and adhere to the association of devotees. Thus one will be able to be liberated from material bondage."

Consequently there are no impediments to pleasing Him or worshiping Him under any conditions, whether one be a child or an old man. The relationship between the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always a fact, and therefore there is no difficulty in pleasing the Lord.",
        "purport": " One may ask, \u201cOne is certainly very attached to family life, but if one gives up family life to be attached to the service of the Lord, one must undergo the same endeavor and trouble. Therefore, what is the benefit of taking the trouble to engage in the service of the Lord?\u201d This is not a valid objection. The Lord asserts in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.4): \u201cIt should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunt\u012b, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.\u201d The Supreme Lord, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, is the seed-giving father of all living entities because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord (mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo \u2026 j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25). As there is no difficulty in establishing the intimate relationship between a father and son, there is no difficulty in reestablishing the natural, intimate relationship between N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and the living entities. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t: if one performs even very slight devotional service, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is always ready to save one from the greatest danger. The definite example is Aj\u0101mila. Aj\u0101mila separated himself from the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing many sinful activities and was condemned by Yamar\u0101ja to be very severely punished, but because at the time of death he chanted the name of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, although he was calling not for the Supreme Lord N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a but for his son named N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, he was saved from the hands of Yamar\u0101ja. Therefore, pleasing N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a does not require as much endeavor as pleasing one\u2019s family, community and nation. We have seen important political leaders killed for a slight discrepancy in their behavior. Therefore pleasing one\u2019s society, family, community and nation is extremely difficult. Pleasing N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, however, is not at all difficult; it is very easy. One\u2019s duty is to revive one\u2019s relationship with N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. A slight endeavor in this direction will make the attempt successful, whereas one will never be successful in pleasing his so-called family, society and nation, even if one endeavors to sacrifice his life. The simple endeavor involved in the devotional service of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord, can make one successful in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has therefore bestowed His blessings by saying, para\u1e41 vijayate \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sa\u1e45k\u012brtanam: \u201cAll glories to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sa\u1e45k\u012brtana!\u201d If one wants to derive the actual benefit from this human form, he must take to the chanting of the holy name of the Lord."

        "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, who is infallible and indefatigable, is present in different forms of life, from the inert living beings [sth\u0101vara], such as the plants, to Brahm\u0101, the foremost created living being. He is also present in the varieties of material creations and in the material elements, the total material energy and the modes of material nature [sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a], as well as the unmanifested material nature and the false ego. Although He is one, He is present everywhere, and He is also the transcendental Supersoul, the cause of all causes, who is present as the observer in the cores of the hearts of all living entities. He is indicated as that which is pervaded and as the all-pervading Supersoul, but actually He cannot be indicated. He is changeless and undivided. He is simply perceived as the supreme sac-cid-\u0101nanda [eternity, knowledge and bliss]. Being covered by the curtain of the external energy, to the atheist He appears nonexistent.",
        "purport": " Not only is the Supreme Personality of Godhead present as the Supersoul of all living entities; at the same time, He pervades everything in the entire creation. He exists in all circumstances and at all times. He exists in the heart of Lord Brahm\u0101 and also in the cores of the hearts of the hogs, dogs, trees, plants and so on. He is present everywhere. He is present not only in the heart of the living entity, but also in material things, even in the atoms, protons and electrons being explored by material scientists. The Lord is present in three features \u2014 as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n. Because He is present everywhere, He is described as sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u exists beyond Brahman. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by His Brahman feature, is all-pervading (may\u0101 tatam ida\u1e41 sarvam), but Brahman depends upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham). Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there could be no existence of Brahman or Param\u0101tm\u0101. Therefore, Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth. Although He is present as the Param\u0101tm\u0101 in the core of everyone\u2019s heart, He is nonetheless one, either as an individual or as the all-pervading Brahman. The supreme cause is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and devotees who have surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can realize Him and His presence within the universe and within the atom (a\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham). This realization is possible only for devotees who have fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord; for others it is not possible. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.14): The process of surrender in a devotional attitude is accepted by a fortunate living being. After wandering through many varieties of life on many planetary systems, when one comes to the real understanding of the Absolute Truth by the grace of a devotee, one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate). Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s class friends, who were born of Daitya families, thought that realizing the Absolute was extremely difficult. Indeed, we have experience that many, many people say this very thing. Actually, however, this is not so. The Absolute, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is most intimately related to all living entities. Therefore if one understands the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy, which explains how He is present everywhere and how He acts everywhere, to worship the Supreme Lord or to realize Him is not at all difficult. Realization of the Lord, however, is possible only in the association of devotees. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in His teachings to R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b said (Cc. Madhya 19.151): The living entity in the material condition wanders through many varieties of life and many varieties of circumstances, but if he comes in contact with a pure devotee and is intelligent enough to take instructions from the pure devotee regarding the process of devotional service, he can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the origin of Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101, without difficulty. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says: The Lord is present as antary\u0101m\u012b in everyone\u2019s heart and is visible in the individual soul covered by a body. Indeed, He is everywhere at every time and every condition, but because He is covered by the curtain of material energy, to an ordinary person there appears to be no God."

Give up your demoniac nature and act without enmity or duality. Show mercy to all living entities by enlightening them in devotional service, thus becoming their well-wishers.",
        "purport": " The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55), bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti y\u0101v\u0101n ya\u015b c\u0101smi tattvata\u1e25: \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.\u201d Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja ultimately instructed his class friends, the sons of the demons, to accept the process of devotional service by preaching the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to everyone. Preaching is the best service to the Lord. The Lord will immediately be extremely satisfied with one who engages in this service of preaching K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.69). Na ca tasm\u0101n manu\u1e63ye\u1e63u ka\u015bcin me priya-k\u1e5bttama\u1e25: \u201cThere is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear.\u201d If one sincerely tries his best to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by preaching the glories of the Lord and His supremacy, even if he is imperfectly educated, he becomes the dearmost servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is bhakti. As one performs this service for humanity, without discrimination between friends and enemies, the Lord becomes satisfied, and the mission of one\u2019s life is fulfilled. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore advised everyone to become a guru-devotee and preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness (y\u0101re dekha, t\u0101re kaha\u00a0\u2018k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019-upade\u015ba). That is the easiest way to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By such preaching, the preacher becomes satisfied, and those to whom he preaches are also satisfied. This is the process of bringing peace and tranquillity to the entire world. One is expected to understand these three formulas of knowledge concerning the Supreme Lord \u2014 that He is the supreme enjoyer, that He is the proprietor of everything, and that He is the best well-wisher and friend of everyone. A preacher should personally understand these truths and preach them to everyone. Then there will be peace and tranquillity all over the world. The word sauh\u1e5bdam (\u201cfriendliness\u201d) is very significant in this verse. People are generally ignorant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore to become their best well-wisher one should teach them about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness without discrimination. Since the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is situated in the core of everyone\u2019s heart, every body is a temple of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. One should not misuse this understanding as an excuse for such words as daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. If N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a lives in the house of a daridra, a poor man, this does not mean that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a becomes poor. He lives everywhere \u2014 in the houses of the poor and those of the rich \u2014 but in all circumstances He remains N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a; to think that He becomes either poor or rich is a material calculation. He is always \u1e63a\u1e0d-ai\u015bvarya-p\u016br\u1e47a, full in six opulences, in all circumstances."

        "translation": "Nothing is unobtainable for devotees who have satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the cause of all causes, the original source of everything. The Lord is the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities. For devotees, therefore, who are transcendental to the modes of material nature, what is the use of following the principles of religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation, which are all automatically obtainable under the influence of the modes of nature? We devotees always glorify the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore we need not ask for anything in terms of dharma, k\u0101ma, artha and mok\u1e63a.",
        "purport": " In an advanced civilization, people are eager to be religious, to be economically well situated, to satisfy their senses to the fullest extent, and at last to attain liberation. However, these are not to be magnified as desirable. Indeed, for a devotee these are all very easily available. Bilvama\u1e45gala \u1e6ch\u0101kura said, mukti\u1e25 svaya\u1e41 mukulit\u0101\u00f1jali sevate\u00a0\u2019sm\u0101n dharm\u0101rtha-k\u0101ma-gataya\u1e25 samaya-prat\u012bk\u1e63\u0101\u1e25. Liberation always stands at the door of a devotee, ready to carry out his orders. Material advancement in religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation simply wait to serve a devotee at the first opportunity. A devotee is already in a transcendental position; he does not need further qualifications to be liberated. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26), sa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate: a devotee is transcendental to the actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature because he is situated on the Brahman platform. Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja said, agu\u1e47ena ca k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63itena: if one is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the lotus feet of the Lord, he does not need anything in terms of dharma, artha, k\u0101ma or mok\u1e63a. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, therefore, in the beginning of the transcendental literature, it is said, dharma\u1e25 projjhita-kaitavo\u00a0\u2019tra. Dharma, artha, k\u0101ma and mok\u1e63a are kaitava \u2014 false and unnecessary. Nirmatsar\u0101\u1e47\u0101m, persons who are completely transcendental to the material activities of separateness, who make no distinction between \u201cmine\u201d and \u201cyours,\u201d but who simply engage in the devotional service of the Lord, are actually fit to accept bh\u0101gavata-dharma (dharm\u0101n bhagavat\u0101n iha). Because they are nirmatsara, not jealous of anyone, they want to make others devotees, even their enemies. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya remarks, k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ate mok\u1e63a-gam api sukha\u1e41 n\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63ato yath\u0101. Devotees are not desirous of any material happiness, including the happiness derived from liberation. This is called any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam. Karm\u012bs desire material happiness, and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs desire liberation, but a devotee does not desire anything; he is simply satisfied by rendering transcendental loving service at the lotus feet of the Lord and glorifying Him everywhere by preaching, which is his life and soul."

        "translation": "Religion, economic development and sense gratification \u2014 these are described in the Vedas as tri-varga, or three ways to salvation. Within these three categories are education and self-realization; ritualistic ceremonies performed according to Vedic injunction; logic; the science of law and order; and the various means of earning one\u2019s livelihood. These are the external subject matters of study in the Vedas, and therefore I consider them material. However, I consider surrender to the lotus feet of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to be transcendental.",
        "purport": " These instructions of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja stress the transcendental position of devotional service. As confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d One who fully engages in the devotional service of the Lord is immediately raised to the transcendental position, which is the brahma-bh\u016bta stage. Any education or activity not on the brahma-bh\u016bta platform, the platform of self-realization, is considered to be material, and Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja says that anything material cannot be the Absolute Truth, for the Absolute Truth is on the spiritual platform. This is also confirmed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.45), where He says, traigu\u1e47ya-vi\u1e63ay\u0101 ved\u0101 nistraigu\u1e47yo bhav\u0101rjuna: \u201cThe Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them.\u201d To act on the material platform, even if one\u2019s activities are sanctioned by the Vedas, is not the ultimate goal of life. The ultimate goal of life is to stay on the spiritual platform, fully surrendered to the parama-puru\u1e63a, the supreme person. This is the object of the human mission. In summary, the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and injunctions are not to be discounted; they are means of being promoted to the spiritual platform. But if one does not come to the spiritual platform, the Vedic ceremonies are simply a waste of time. This is confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.8): \u201cDuties [dharma] executed by men, regardless of occupation, are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Supreme Lord.\u201d If one very strictly performs the various duties of religion but does not ultimately come to the platform of surrendering to the Supreme Lord, his methods of attaining salvation or elevation are simply a waste of time and energy."
