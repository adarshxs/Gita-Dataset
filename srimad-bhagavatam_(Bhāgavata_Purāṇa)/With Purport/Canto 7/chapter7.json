        "purport": " It is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (9.19.17) One should not remain in a secluded place with a woman, even one\u2019s mother, sister, or daughter. Nonetheless, although one is strictly prohibited from staying with a woman in a secluded place, N\u0101rada Muni gave shelter to Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\u2019s young mother, who rendered service to him with great devotion and faith. Does this mean that N\u0101rada Muni transgressed the Vedic injunctions? Certainly he did not. Such injunctions are intended for mundane creatures, but N\u0101rada Muni is transcendental to mundane categories. N\u0101rada Muni is a great saint and is transcendentally situated. Therefore, although he was a young man, he could give shelter to a young woman and accept her service. Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura also spoke with a young woman, a prostitute, in the dead of night, but the woman could not deviate his mind. Instead, she became a Vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u012b, a pure devotee, by the benediction of Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura. Ordinary persons, however, should not imitate such highly elevated devotees. Ordinary persons must strictly observe the rules and regulations by staying aloof from the association of women. No one should imitate N\u0101rada Muni or Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura. It is said, vai\u1e63\u1e47avera kriy\u0101-mudr\u0101 vij\u00f1e n\u0101 bujhaya. Even if a man is very advanced in learning, he cannot understand the behavior of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Anyone can take shelter of a pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, without fear. Therefore in the previous verse it has been distinctly said, devar\u1e63er antike s\u0101kuto-bhay\u0101: Kay\u0101dhu, the mother of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, stayed under the protection of N\u0101rada Muni without fear from any direction. Similarly, N\u0101rada Muni, in his transcendental position, stayed with the young woman without fear of deviation. N\u0101rada Muni, Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura and similar \u0101c\u0101ryas especially empowered to broadcast the glories of the Lord cannot be brought down to the material platform. Therefore one is strictly forbidden to think that the \u0101c\u0101rya is an ordinary human being (guru\u1e63u nara-mati\u1e25)."

        "purport": " These words of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja are very important in regard to knowledge descending by the disciplic succession. Even when Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a baby within the womb of his mother, he became fully convinced of the existence of the supreme power because of hearing the powerful instructions of N\u0101rada and understood how to attain perfection in life by bhakti-yoga. These are the most important understandings in spiritual knowledge. \u201cUnto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23) \u201cNo one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is by the blunt material senses. But He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.234) \u201cOne can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d (Bg. 18.55) These are Vedic instructions. One must have full faith in the words of the spiritual master and similar faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the real knowledge of \u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the distinction between matter and spirit will be automatically revealed. This \u0101tma-tattva, or spiritual knowledge, will be revealed within the core of a devotee\u2019s heart because of his having taken shelter of the lotus feet of a mah\u0101jana such as Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. In this verse the word bh\u016by\u0101t may be understood to mean \u201clet there be.\u201d Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja offers his blessings to his class friends, saying, \u201cAlso become faithful like me. Become bona fide Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas.\u201d A devotee of the Lord desires for everyone to take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Unfortunately, however, people sometimes do not have staunch faith in the words of the spiritual master who comes by the disciplic succession, and therefore they are unable to understand transcendental knowledge. The spiritual master must be in the line of authorized disciplic succession, like Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who received the knowledge from N\u0101rada. If the class friends of Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the sons of demons, were to accept the truth through Prahl\u0101da, they would certainly also become fully aware of transcendental knowledge. The words vai\u015b\u0101rad\u012b dh\u012b\u1e25 refer to intelligence concerning the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is extremely expert. The Lord has created wonderful universes by His expert knowledge. Unless one is extremely expert, he cannot understand the expert management of the supreme expert. One can understand, however, if one is fortunate enough to meet a bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic succession from Lord Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, Mother Lak\u1e63m\u012b or the Kum\u0101ras. These four samprad\u0101yas, or disciplic successions of knowledge and transcendence, are called the Brahma samprad\u0101ya, Rudra samprad\u0101ya, \u015ar\u012b samprad\u0101ya, and Kum\u0101ra samprad\u0101ya. Samprad\u0101ya-vih\u012bn\u0101 ye mantr\u0101s te ni\u1e63phal\u0101 mat\u0101\u1e25. The knowledge of the Supreme received from such a samprad\u0101ya, or disciplic succession, can give one enlightenment. If one does not take to the path of disciplic succession, it is not possible for one to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one understands the Supreme Lord through devotional service with faith in the disciplic succession and then advances further, he awakens his natural love for God, and then his success in life is assured."

However, there are no such changes for the spirit soul.",
        "purport": " This is a very important verse in understanding the difference between the spiritual soul and the material body. The soul is eternal, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.20): \u201cFor the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.\u201d The spirit soul is eternal, being freed from waste and change, which take place because of the material body. The example of a tree and its fruits and flowers is very simple and clear. A tree stands for many, many years, but with the seasonal changes its fruits and flowers undergo six transformations. The foolish theory of modern chemists that life can be produced by chemical interactions cannot be accepted as truth. The birth of a human being\u2019s material body takes place due to a mixture of the ovum and semen, but the history of birth is that although the ovum and semen mix together after sex, there is not always pregnancy. Unless the soul enters the mixture, there is no possibility of pregnancy, but when the soul takes shelter of the mixture the body takes birth, exists, grows, transforms and dwindles, and ultimately it is vanquished. The fruits and flowers of a tree seasonally come and go, but the tree continues to stand. Similarly, the transmigrating soul accepts various bodies, which undergo six transformations, but the soul remains permanently the same (ajo nitya\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvato\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47o na hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre). The soul is eternal and ever existing, but the bodies accepted by the soul are changing. There are two kinds of soul \u2014 the Supreme Soul (the Personality of Godhead) and the individual soul (the living entity). As various bodily changes take place in the individual soul, different millenniums of creation take place in the Supreme Soul. In this regard, Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says: Since the body is the external feature of the soul, the soul is not dependent on the body; rather, the body is dependent on the soul. One who understands this truth should not be very much anxious about the maintenance of his body. There is no possibility of maintaining the body permanently or eternally. Antavanta ime deh\u0101 nityasyokt\u0101\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25. This is the statement of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.18). The material body is antavat (perishable), but the soul within the body is eternal (nityasyokt\u0101\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25). Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and the individual souls, who are part and parcel of Him, are both eternal. Nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the chief living being, whereas the individual living entities are parts of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. All the various grades of bodies \u2014 from the gigantic universal body to the small body of an ant \u2014 are perishable, but the Supersoul and the soul, being equal in quality, both exist eternally. This is further explained in the next verses."

Both of them are spiritual, free from birth and death, free from deterioration and free from material contamination. They are individual, they are the knowers of the external body, and they are the foundation or shelter of everything. They are free from material change, they are self-illuminated, they are the cause of all causes, and they are all-pervading. They have nothing to do with the material body, and therefore they are always uncovered. With these transcendental qualities, one who is actually learned must give up the illusory conception of life, in which one thinks, \u201cI am this material body, and everything in relationship with this body is mine.\u201d",
        "purport": " In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7) Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says, mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015bo j\u012bva-loke j\u012bva-bh\u016bta\u1e25: \u201cAll the living entities are part of Me.\u201d Therefore the living entities are qualitatively the same as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the leader, the Supreme among all the living entities. In the Vedas it is said, nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m: the Lord is the chief individual living entity, the leader of the subordinate living entities. Because the living entities are parts or samples of God, their qualities are not different from those of the Supreme Lord. The living entities have the same qualities as the Lord, just as a drop of sea water is composed of the same chemicals as the great sea itself. Thus there is oneness in quality but a difference in quantity. One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by understanding the sample, the living entity, because all the qualities of God exist in a minute quantity in the living entities. There is oneness, but God is great whereas the living entities are extremely small. A\u1e47or a\u1e47\u012by\u0101n mahato mah\u012by\u0101n (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.2.20). The living entities are smaller than the atom, but God is greater than the greatest. Our conception of greatness may be represented by the sky because we think of the sky as being unlimitedly big, but God is bigger than the sky. Similarly, we have knowledge that the living entities are smaller than atoms, being one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair, yet the quality of being the supreme cause of all causes exists in the living entity as well as in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, it is due to the presence of the living entity that the body exists and bodily changes take place. Similarly, it is because the Supreme Lord is within this universe that the changes dictated by the material laws occur. The word eka\u1e25, meaning \u201cindividual,\u201d is significant. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.4), mat-sth\u0101ni sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ni na c\u0101ha\u1e41 te\u1e63v avasthita\u1e25. Everything, material and spiritual, including earth, water, air, fire, sky and the living entities, exists on the platform of spirit soul. Although everything is an emanation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not think that the Supreme Lord is dependent upon anything else. Both God and the living entity are fully conscious. As living entities, we are conscious of our bodily existence. Similarly, the Lord is conscious of the gigantic cosmic manifestation. This is confirmed in the Vedas. Yasmin dyau\u1e25 p\u1e5bthiv\u012b c\u0101ntar\u012bk\u1e63am. Vij\u00f1\u0101t\u0101ram adhikena vij\u0101n\u012by\u0101t. Ekam ev\u0101dvit\u012byam. \u0100tma-jyoti\u1e25 samr\u0101\u1e0d ihov\u0101ca. Sa im\u0101n lok\u0101n as\u1e5bjata. Satya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam anantam. Asa\u1e45go hy aya\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e25. P\u016br\u1e47asya p\u016br\u1e47am \u0101d\u0101ya p\u016br\u1e47am ev\u0101va\u015bi\u1e63yate. All these Vedic injunctions prove that both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the minute soul are individual. One is great, and the other is small, but both of them are the cause of all causes \u2014 the corporally limited and the universally unlimited. We should always remember that although we are equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality, we are never equal to Him in quantity. Persons with a small fund of intelligence, finding themselves equal in quality with God, foolishly think that they are equal in quantity also. Their intelligence is called avi\u015buddha-buddhaya\u1e25 \u2014 unpolished or contaminated intelligence. When such persons, after endeavoring hard for many, many lives to understand the supreme cause, are finally in actual knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, they surrender unto Him (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25). Thus they become great mah\u0101tm\u0101s, perfect souls. If one is fortunate enough to understand his relationship with God, knowing that God is great (vibhu) whereas the living entity is small (a\u1e47u), he is perfect in knowledge. The individual exists in darkness when he thinks that he is the material body and that everything in relationship with the material body belongs to him. This is called aha\u1e41 mama (janasya moho\u00a0\u2019yam aha\u1e41 mameti). This is illusion. One must give up his illusory conception and thus become fully aware of everything."

However, as one who is not expert cannot understand where there is gold, a foolish person who has not cultivated spiritual knowledge cannot understand how the spirit exists within the body.",
        "purport": " Here is a very good example concerning spiritual understanding. Foolish rascals, including so-called j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, philosophers and scientists, cannot understand the existence of the soul within the body because they are lacking in spiritual knowledge. The Vedas enjoin, tad-vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sa gurum ev\u0101bhigacchet: to understand spiritual knowledge, one must approach a bona fide spiritual master. Unless one has been trained in geology, one cannot detect gold in stone. Similarly, unless one has been trained by a spiritual master, he cannot understand what is spirit and what is matter. Here it is said, yogais tad-abhij\u00f1a\u1e25. This indicates that one who has connected himself with spiritual knowledge can understand that there is a spiritual soul within the body. However, one who is in an animalistic conception of life and has no spiritual culture cannot understand. As an expert mineralogist or geologist can understand where there is gold and can then invest his money to dig there and chemically separate the gold from the ore, an expert spiritualist can understand where the soul is within matter. One who has not been trained cannot distinguish between gold and stone. Similarly, fools and rascals who have not learned from an expert spiritual master what is soul and what is matter cannot understand the existence of the soul within the body. To understand such knowledge, one must be trained in the mystic yoga system, or, finally, in the bhakti-yoga system. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.55), bhakty\u0101 m\u0101m abhij\u0101n\u0101ti. Unless one takes shelter of the bhakti-yoga process, one cannot understand the existence of the soul within the body. Therefore Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 begins by teaching: \u201cAs the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d (Bg. 2.13) Thus the first instruction is that one should understand that the soul is within the body and is transmigrating from one body to another. This is the beginning of spiritual knowledge. Any person who is not expert in understanding this science or is unwilling to understand it remains in the bodily conception of life, or the animalistic conception of life, as confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (yasy\u0101tma-buddhi\u1e25 ku\u1e47ape tri-dh\u0101tuke \u2026 sa eva go-khara\u1e25). Every member of human society should clearly understand the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, for only in this way can one be spiritually elevated and automatically give up the false, illusory knowledge by which one thinks, \u201cI am this body, and everything belonging to this body is mine [aha\u1e41 mameti].\u201d This doggish conception should be rejected immediately. One should be prepared to understand the spirit soul and the supreme spirit, God, who are eternally related. Thus one may return home, back to Godhead, having solved all the problems of life."

Within the earth are the fragrance of roses, the taste of sweet fruit, and whatever else we want. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.10.4), sarva-k\u0101ma-dugh\u0101 mah\u012b: the earth (mah\u012b) contains all our requirements. Thus the objects of sense perception are all present in bh\u016bmi, or the earth. The gross material elements and subtle material elements (mind, intelligence and aha\u1e45k\u0101ra, false ego) constitute the total material energy.

These qualities \u2014 sattva-gu\u1e47a, rajo-gu\u1e47a and tamo-gu\u1e47a \u2014 belong not to the soul but to the material energy. It is because of the interaction of these three material modes of nature that the five knowledge-gathering senses, the five working senses and their controller, the mind, are manifested. Then, according to these modes, the living entity gets the opportunity to perform different types of karma with different types of knowledge, thinking, feeling and willing. Thus the bodily machine begins to work. This has all been properly analyzed in s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga by the great \u0101c\u0101ryas, especially by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in His incarnation as Devah\u016bti-putra Kapila. This is indicated here by the word \u0101c\u0101ryai\u1e25. We need not follow anyone who is not an authorized \u0101c\u0101rya. \u0100c\u0101ryav\u0101n puru\u1e63o veda: one can understand the truth fully when he has taken shelter of an expert \u0101c\u0101rya. The living entity is individual, but the body is a composition of many material elements. This is proved by the fact that as soon as the living entity quits this combination of material elements, it becomes a mere conglomeration of matter. The matter is qualitatively one, and the spiritual soul is qualitatively one with the Supreme. The Supreme is one, and the individual soul is one, but the individual soul is understood to be the master of the individual combination of material energy, whereas the Supreme Lord is the controller of the total material energy. The living entity is the master of his particular body, and according to his activities he is subjected to different types of pains and pleasures. However, although the Supreme Person, the Param\u0101tm\u0101, is also one, He is present as an individual in all the different bodies. The material energy is in fact divided into twenty-four elements. The individual soul, the owner of the individual body, is a twenty-fifth subject, and above everything is Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as Param\u0101tm\u0101, the supreme controller, who is the twenty-sixth subject. When one understands all of these twenty-six subjects, he becomes adhy\u0101tma-vit, an expert in understanding the distinction between matter and spirit. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.3), k\u1e63etra-k\u1e63etraj\u00f1ayor j\u00f1\u0101nam: understanding of the k\u1e63etra (the constitution of the body) and of the individual soul and the Supersoul constitutes real j\u00f1\u0101na, or knowledge. Unless one ultimately understands that the Supreme Lord is eternally related with the individual soul, one\u2019s knowledge is imperfect. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.19): \u201cAfter many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.\u201d Everything, material and spiritual, consists of various energies of V\u0101sudeva, to whom the individual soul, the spiritual part of the Supreme Lord, is subordinate. Upon understanding this perfect knowledge, one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 sudurlabha\u1e25)."

An expert in the study of soil can find out where gold is and then dig there. He can then analyze the stone and test the gold with nitric acid.

In studying one\u2019s own body, one must ask himself whether his head is his soul, his fingers are his soul, his hand is his soul, and so on. In this way, one must gradually reject all the material elements and the combinations of material elements in the body.

The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d (Bg. 2.13) The spirit soul possesses the body and is within the body. This is the real analysis. The soul never mixes with the bodily elements. Although the soul is within the body, it is separate and always pure. One must analyze and understand his self. This is self-realization. Neti neti is the analytical process of rejecting matter. By expertly conducting such an analysis, one can understand where the soul is. One who is not expert, however, cannot distinguish gold from earth, nor the soul from the body."

        "purport": " A sober person can study himself and distinguish the soul from the body by analytical study. For example, when one considers his body \u2014 his head, his hands and so on \u2014 one can certainly understand the difference between the spirit soul and the body. No one says, \u201cI head.\u201d Everyone says, \u201cMy head.\u201d Thus there are two entities \u2014 the head and \u201cI.\u201d They are not identical, although they appear to be one conglomeration. One may argue, \u201cWhen we analyze the body we find a head, hands, legs, a belly, blood, bones, urine, stool and so on, but after everything is considered, where is the existence of the soul?\u201d A sober man, however, avails himself of this Vedic instruction: yato v\u0101 im\u0101ni bh\u016bt\u0101ni j\u0101yante; yena j\u0101t\u0101ni j\u012bvanti; yat prayanty abhisa\u1e41vi\u015banti; tad vijij\u00f1\u0101sasva; tad brahmeti. (Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad 3.1.1) Thus he can understand that the head, hands, legs and indeed the entire body have grown on the basis of the soul. If the soul is within, the body, head, hands and legs grow, but otherwise they do not. A dead child does not grow up, for the soul is not present. If by a careful analysis of the body one still cannot find the existence of the soul, this is due to his ignorance. How can a gross man fully engaged in materialistic activities understand the soul, which is a small particle of spirit one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair? Such a person foolishly thinks that the material body has grown from a combination of chemicals, although he cannot find them. The Vedas inform us, however, that chemical combinations do not constitute the living force; the living force is the \u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101, and the body grows on the basis of that living force. The fruit of a tree grows and undergoes six kinds of change because of the presence of the tree. If there were no tree, there could be no question of the growth and maturity of fruit. Therefore, beyond the existence of the body are the Param\u0101tm\u0101 and \u0101tm\u0101 within the body. This is the first understanding of spiritual knowledge explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Dehino\u00a0\u2019smin yath\u0101 dehe. The body exists because of the presence of the Supreme Lord and the j\u012bva, which is part of the Lord. This is further explained by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.4): \u201cBy Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.\u201d The Supreme Soul exists everywhere. The Vedas enjoin, sarva\u1e41 khalv ida\u1e41 brahma: everything is Brahman or an expansion of Brahman\u2019s energies. S\u016btre ma\u1e47i-ga\u1e47\u0101 iva: everything rests on the Lord, just like pearls strung together on a thread. The thread is the principal Brahman. He is the supreme cause, the Supreme Lord upon whom everything rests (matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat). Thus we must study the \u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101 \u2014 the individual soul and the Supersoul \u2014 upon whom the entire material cosmic manifestation rests. This is explained by the Vedic statement yato v\u0101 im\u0101ni bh\u016bt\u0101ni j\u0101yante; yena j\u0101t\u0101ni j\u012bvanti."

Thus the soul is the observer of these three states. Actually, the activities of the body are not the activities of the soul. The soul is different from the body. Just as aromas are distinct from the material vehicle in which they are carried, the soul is unattached to material activities. This analysis can be considered by a person who is fully under the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. This is confirmed by the Vedic injunction yasmin vij\u00f1\u0101te sarvam eva\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 bhavati. If one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can automatically understand everything else. Because of not taking shelter of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet, even great scholars, scientists, philosophers and religionists are always bewildered. This is confirmed in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.2.32): Even though one may artificially think himself liberated from material contamination, if he has not taken shelter of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet his intelligence is polluted.

Ultimately, when one\u2019s intelligence becomes clear through devotional service, one is situated in buddhi-yoga. This also is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (dad\u0101mi buddhi-yoga\u1e41 ta\u1e41 yena m\u0101m upay\u0101nti te).

        "translation": "Through polluted intelligence one is subjected to the modes of nature, and thus one is conditioned by material existence. Like a dreaming state in which one falsely suffers, material existence, which is due to ignorance, must be considered unwanted and temporary.",
        "purport": " The unwanted condition of temporary life is called ignorance. One can very easily understand that the material body is temporary, for it is generated at a certain date and ends at a certain date, after undergoing the six kinds of change, namely birth, death, growth, maintenance, transformation and dwindling. This condition of the eternal soul is due to his ignorance, and although it is temporary, it is unwanted. Because of ignorance one is put into temporary bodies one after another. The spirit soul, however, does not need to enter such temporary bodies. He does so only due to his ignorance or his forgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore in the human form of life, when one\u2019s intelligence is developed, one should change his consciousness by trying to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then one can be liberated. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9), where the Lord says: \u201cOne who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.\u201d Unless one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and comes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one must continue in material bondage. To end this conditional life, one must surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, that is demanded by the Supreme Lord. Sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. As advised by Mah\u0101r\u0101ja \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva, na s\u0101dhu manye yata \u0101tmano\u00a0\u2019yam asann api kle\u015bada \u0101sa deha\u1e25. One must be intelligent enough to understand that although one\u2019s body is temporary and will not endure for long, as long as one has a body he must undergo the pangs of material existence. Therefore, if by good association, by the instructions of a bona fide spiritual master, one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his conditional life of material existence is vanquished, and his original consciousness, known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is revived. When one is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he can realize that material existence, whether one is awake or dreaming, is nothing but a dream and has no factual value. This realization is possible by the grace of the Supreme Lord. This grace is also present in the form of the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Therefore \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s mission is for everyone to engage in welfare activities to awaken the foolish living entity, especially in human society, so that he may come to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and benefit by liberation from conditional life. In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya cites the following verses: One must realize that the material condition of life is full of distresses. One can realize this with purified intelligence. When one\u2019s intelligence is purified, he can understand that unwanted, temporary, material life is just like a dream. Just as one suffers pain when his head is cut off in a dream, in ignorance one suffers not only while dreaming but also while awake. Without the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one continues in ignorance and is thus subjected to material distresses in various ways."

In other words, when one takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his ignorance is immediately dissipated.",
        "purport": " This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26): \u201cOne who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.\u201d By the practice of bhakti-yoga, one immediately comes to the spiritual platform, transcendental to the actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature. The root of ignorance is material consciousness, which must be killed by spiritual consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The word b\u012bja-nirhara\u1e47am refers to burning the root cause of material life to ashes. In the Medin\u012b dictionary, yoga is explained by its result: yoge\u00a0\u2019p\u016brv\u0101rtha-sampr\u0101ptau sa\u1e45gati-dhy\u0101na-yukti\u1e63u. When one is put into an awkward position because of ignorance, the process by which one can be freed from this entanglement is called yoga. This is also called liberation. Muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101-r\u016bpa\u1e41 svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25. Mukti means giving up one\u2019s position in ignorance or illusion, by which one thinks in a way contrary to his constitutional position. Returning to one\u2019s constitutional position is called mukti, and the process by which one does this is called yoga. Thus yoga is above karma, j\u00f1\u0101na and s\u0101\u1e45khya. Indeed, yoga is the ultimate goal of life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore advised Arjuna to become a yog\u012b (tasm\u0101d yog\u012b bhav\u0101rjuna). Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a further advised in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the first-class yog\u012b is he who has come to the platform of devotional service. \u201cOf all yog\u012bs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\u201d (Bg. 6.47) Thus one who always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within the core of his heart is the best yog\u012b. By practicing this best of all yoga systems, one is liberated from the material condition."

That process is clearly explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, where the Lord says, sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja: \u201cAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.\u201d This process is the best because the Lord assures, aha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25: \u201cI shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.\u201d There is no need to be worried, for the Lord Himself assures that He will care for His devotee and save him from the reactions of sinful activities. Material bondage is a result of sinful activity. Therefore, since the Lord assures that He will dissipate the results of fruitive material activities, there is no need to be worried. This process of understanding one\u2019s position as a spirit soul and then engaging oneself in devotional service is therefore the best. The entire Vedic program is based on this principle, and one can understand it as recommended in the Vedas: \u201cUnto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23) One must accept the pure devotee, the representative of God, as one\u2019s guru and then offer him all the respects one would offer the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the secret of success. For one who adopts this method, the perfect process is revealed. In this verse, the words yair a\u00f1jas\u0101 rati\u1e25 indicate that by offering service and surrendering to the spiritual master, one is elevated to devotional service, and by performing devotional service one gradually becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of this attachment to the Lord, one can understand the Lord. In other words, one can understand what the Lord\u2019s position is, what our position is and what our relationship is. All this can be understood very easily by the simple method of bhakti-yoga. As soon as one is situated on the platform of bhakti-yoga, the root cause of one\u2019s suffering and material bondage is destroyed. This is clearly explained in the next verse, which gives the secret of success."

Everything should be offered to the spiritual master as a matter of duty, but the offering should be made to the spiritual master with heart and soul, not artificially to gain material prestige. This offering is called arpa\u1e47a. Moreover, one should live among devotees, saintly persons, to learn the etiquette and proper behavior of devotional service. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura remarks in this connection that whatever is offered to the spiritual master should be offered with love and affection, not for material adoration. Similarly, it is recommended that one associate with devotees, but there must be some discrimination. Actually, a s\u0101dhu, a saintly person, must be saintly in his behavior (s\u0101dhava\u1e25 sad-\u0101c\u0101r\u0101\u1e25). Unless one adheres to the standard behavior, one\u2019s position as a s\u0101dhu, a saintly person, is not complete. Therefore a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a s\u0101dhu, must completely adhere to the standard of behavior. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says that a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a person initiated into the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava cult, should be offered the respect befitting a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, which means that he should be offered service and prayers. However, one should not associate with him if he is not a fit person with whom to associate."

Fools and rascals, who are not in the transcendental position, consider these uncommon activities of the Lord to be mythological, but when the pure devotee, the liberated person, hears about these uncommon activities of the Lord, he immediately becomes ecstatic and exhibits the symptoms of chanting, dancing, and crying very loudly and jubilantly.

Because of his intense devotional service, his ignorance, material consciousness and all kinds of material desires are completely burnt to ashes. This is the stage at which one can achieve the shelter of the Lord\u2019s lotus feet.",
        "purport": " When a devotee is completely purified, he becomes any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya. In other words, all of his material desires become zero, being burnt to ashes, and he exists either as the Lord\u2019s servant, friend, father, mother or conjugal lover. Because one thinks constantly in this way, one\u2019s present material body and mind are fully spiritualized, and the needs of one\u2019s material body completely vanish from one\u2019s existence. An iron rod put into a fire becomes warmer and warmer, and when it is red hot it is no longer an iron rod but fire. Similarly, when a devotee constantly engages in devotional service and thinks of the Lord in his original K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he no longer has any material activities, for his body is spiritualized. Advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is very powerful, and therefore even during this life such a devotee has achieved the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. This transcendental ecstatic existence of a devotee was completely exhibited by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu. In this regard, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya writes as follows: The ecstatic condition of devotional service was completely exhibited by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who sometimes danced, sometimes cried, sometimes sang, sometimes remained silent, and sometimes chanted the holy name of the Lord. That is perfect spiritual existence."

This wheel, however, completely stops when one is in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, by the transcendental bliss realized from constant engagement in devotional service, one is completely liberated from material existence. All learned men know this. Therefore, my dear friends, O sons of the asuras, immediately begin meditating upon and worshiping the Supersoul within everyone\u2019s heart.",
        "purport": " Generally it is understood that by merging into the existence of Brahman, the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth, one becomes completely happy. The words brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a refer to connecting with the Absolute Truth, who is realized in three features: brahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate. One feels brahma-sukha, spiritual happiness, by merging into the impersonal Brahman because the brahmajyoti is the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yasya prabh\u0101 prabhavato jagad-a\u1e47\u1e0da-ko\u1e6di. Yasya prabh\u0101, the impersonal Brahman, consists of the rays of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental body. Therefore whatever transcendental bliss one feels from merging in Brahman is due to contact with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Contact with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is perfect brahma-sukha. When the mind is in touch with the impersonal Brahman one becomes satisfied, but one must advance further to render service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for one\u2019s remaining merged in the Brahman effulgence is not always assured. As it is said, \u0101ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25 patanty adho\u00a0\u2019n\u0101d\u1e5bta-yu\u1e63mad-a\u1e45ghraya\u1e25: one may merge in the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth, but there is a chance that one may fall because of not being acquainted with Adhok\u1e63aja, or V\u0101sudeva. Of course, such brahma-sukha undoubtedly eliminates material happiness, but when one advances through impersonal Brahman and localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead in relationship with Him as a servant, friend, parent or conjugal lover, one\u2019s happiness becomes all-pervading. Then one automatically feels transcendental bliss, just as one becomes happy seeing the shining of the moon. One acquires natural happiness upon seeing the moon, but when one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one\u2019s transcendental happiness increases hundreds and thousands of times. As soon as one is very intimately connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one surely becomes free from all material contamination. Y\u0101 nirv\u1e5btis tanu-bh\u1e5bt\u0101m. This cessation of all material happiness is called nirv\u1e5bti or nirv\u0101\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.1.38): \u201cIf brahm\u0101nanda, the bliss of merging in the Brahman effulgence, were multiplied one hundred trillion times, it would still not equal even an atomic fragment of the ocean of transcendental bliss felt in devotional service.\u201d \u201cOne who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto the Lord.\u201d (Bg. 18.54) If one advances further from the brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a platform, one enters the stage of devotional service (mad-bhakti\u1e41 labhate par\u0101m). The word adhok\u1e63aj\u0101lambham refers to keeping the mind always engaged in the Absolute Truth, who is beyond the mind and material speculation. Sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25. This is the result of Deity worship. By constantly engaging in the service of the Lord and thinking of His lotus feet, one is automatically freed from all material contamination. Thus the word brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a-sukham indicates that when one is in touch with the Absolute Truth, material sense gratification is completely nullified."

        "translation": "O my friends, sons of the asuras, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Supersoul feature always exists within the cores of the hearts of all living entities. Indeed, He is the well-wisher and friend of all living entities, and there is no difficulty in worshiping the Lord. Why, then, should people not engage in His devotional service? Why are they so addicted to unnecessarily producing artificial paraphernalia for sense gratification?",
        "purport": " Because the Personality of Godhead is supreme, no one is equal to Him, and no one is greater than Him. Nonetheless, if one is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord is easily obtainable. The Lord is compared to the sky because the sky is vast yet within the reach of all, not only of human beings but even of the animals. The Supreme Lord, in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature, exists as the best well-wisher and friend. As confirmed in the Vedas, sayujau sakh\u0101yau. The Lord, in His Supersoul feature, always stays in the heart along with the living entity. The Lord is so friendly to the living entity that He remains within the heart so that one can always contact Him without difficulty. One can do this simply by devotional service (\u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 smarana\u1e41 p\u0101da-sevanam). As soon as one hears of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-k\u012brtana), one immediately comes in touch with the Lord. A devotee immediately comes in touch with the Lord by any or all of the items of devotional service: Therefore there is no difficulty in coming in contact with the Supreme Lord (ko\u00a0\u2019ti-pray\u0101sa\u1e25). On the other hand, going to hell requires great endeavor. If one wants to go to hell by illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication, he must acquire so many things. For illicit sex he must arrange for money for brothels, for meat-eating he must arrange for many slaughterhouses, for gambling he must arrange for casinos and hotels, and for intoxication he must open many breweries. Clearly, therefore, if one wants to go to hell he must endeavor very much, but if he wants to return home, back to Godhead, there is no difficult endeavor. To go back to Godhead, one may live alone anywhere, in any condition, and simply sit down, meditate upon the Supersoul and chant and hear about the Lord. Thus there is no difficulty in approaching the Lord. Ad\u0101nta-gobhir vi\u015bat\u0101\u1e41 tamisram. Because of inability to control the senses, one must go through great endeavor to go to hell, but if one is sensible he can very easily obtain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the Lord is always with him. By the simple method of \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, the Lord is satisfied. Indeed, the Lord says: \u201cIf one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.\u201d (Bg. 9.26) One can meditate upon the Lord anywhere and everywhere. Thus Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja advised his friends, the sons of the demons, to take this path back home, back to Godhead, without difficulty."

Since the opportunity of human life is temporary, what benefit can these material opulences give to a sensible man who has understood himself to be eternal?",
        "purport": " This verse describes how the advocates of economic development are frustrated by the laws of nature. As the previous verse asks, ki\u1e41 vi\u1e63ayopap\u0101danai\u1e25: what is the actual benefit of so-called economic development? The history of the world has factually proved that attempts to increase economic development for bodily comfort through the advancement of material civilization have done nothing to remedy the inevitability of birth, death, old age and disease. Everyone has knowledge of huge empires throughout the history of the world \u2014 the Roman Empire, the Moghul Empire, the British Empire and so on \u2014 but all the societies engaged in such economic development (sarve\u00a0\u2019rtha-k\u0101m\u0101\u1e25) have been frustrated by the laws of nature through periodic wars, pestilence, famine and so on. Thus all their attempts have been flickering and temporary. In this verse, therefore, it is said, kurvanti martyasya kiyat priya\u1e41 cal\u0101\u1e25: one may be very proud of possessing a vast empire, but such empires are impermanent; after one hundred or two hundred years, everything is finished. All such positions of economic development, although created with great endeavor and hardship, are vanquished very soon. Therefore they have been described as cal\u0101\u1e25. An intelligent man should conclude that material economic development is not at all pleasing. The entire world is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as du\u1e25kh\u0101layam a\u015b\u0101\u015bvatam \u2014 miserable and temporary. Economic development may be pleasing for some time, but it cannot endure. Thus many big businessmen are now very morose because they are being harassed by various plundering governments. In conclusion, why should one waste his time for so-called economic development, which is neither permanent nor pleasing to the soul? On the other hand, our relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is eternal. Nitya-siddha k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-prema. The pure souls are eternally in love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this permanent love, either as a servant, a friend, a parent or a conjugal lover, is not at all difficult to revive. Especially in this age, the concession is that simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra (harer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101maiva kevalam) one revives his original relationship with God and thus becomes so happy that he does not want anything material. As enunciated by \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, na dhana\u1e41 na jana\u1e41 na sundar\u012b\u1e41 kavit\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101 jagad-\u012b\u015ba k\u0101maye.

The satisfaction of possessing material opulences, although perhaps of a different standard, is available even in the lives of dogs and hogs, who cannot revive their eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In human life, however, our eternal, dormant relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is possible to revive. Therefore Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja has described this life as arthadam. Consequently, instead of wasting our time for economic development, which cannot give us any happiness, if we simply try to revive our eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we will properly utilize our lives."

        "translation": "It is learned from Vedic literature that by performing great sacrifices one may elevate himself to the heavenly planets. However, although life on the heavenly planets is hundreds and thousands of times more comfortable than life on earth, the heavenly planets are not pure [nirmalam], or free from the taint of material existence. The heavenly planets are also temporary, and therefore they are not the goal of life. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, has never been seen or heard to possess inebriety. Consequently, for your own benefit and self-realization, you must worship the Lord with great devotion, as described in the revealed scriptures.",
        "purport": " As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti. Even if one is promoted to the higher planetary systems by performing great sacrifices, which are accompanied by the sinful act of sacrificing animals, the standard of happiness in Svargaloka is also not free of disturbances. There is a similar struggle for existence even for the King of heaven, Indra. Thus there is no practical benefit in promoting oneself to the heavenly planets. Indeed, from the heavenly planets one must return to this earth after one has exhausted the results of his pious activities. In the Vedas it is said, tad yatheha karma-jito loka\u1e25 k\u1e63\u012byate evam ev\u0101mutra pu\u1e47ya-jito loka\u1e25 k\u1e63\u012byata. As the material positions we acquire here by hard work are vanquished in due course of time, one\u2019s residence in the heavenly planets is also eventually vanquished. According to one\u2019s activities of piety in different degrees, one obtains different standards of life, but none of them are permanent, and therefore they are all impure. Consequently, one should not endeavor to be promoted to the higher planetary systems, only to return to this earth or descend still lower to the hellish planets. To stop this cycle of going up and coming down, one must take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu therefore said: The living entity is rotating in the cycle of birth and death, going sometimes to the higher planets and sometimes to the lower planets, but that is not the solution to the problems of life. But if by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one is fortunate enough to meet a guru, a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one gets the clue to returning home, back to Godhead, having achieved self-realization. This is what is actually desirable. Bhajat\u0101tma-labdhaye: one must take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for self-realization."

Everyone has achieved a certain type of body given by material nature according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \u201cThe Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.\u201d (Bg. 18.61) The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, is present in everyone\u2019s heart, and as the living entity desires, the Lord gives him facilities with which to work according to his ambitions in different grades of bodies. The body is just like an instrument by which the living entity moves according to false desires for happiness and thus suffers the pangs of birth, death, old age and disease in different standards of life. Everyone begins his activities with some plan and ambition, but actually, from the beginning of one\u2019s plan to the end, one does not derive any happiness. On the contrary, as soon as one begins acting according to his plan, his life of distress immediately begins. Therefore, one should not be ambitious to dissipate the unhappy conditions of life, for one cannot do anything about them. Aha\u1e45k\u0101ra-vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101tm\u0101 kart\u0101ham iti manyate. Although one is acting according to false ambitions, he thinks he can improve his material conditions by his activities. The Vedas enjoin that one should not try to increase happiness or decrease distress, for this is futile. Tasyaiva heto\u1e25 prayateta kovida\u1e25. One should work for self-realization, not for economic development, which is impossible to improve. Without endeavor, one can get the amount of happiness and distress for which he is destined, and one cannot change this. Therefore, it is better to use one\u2019s time for advancement in the spiritual life of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should not waste his valuable life as a human being. It is better to utilize this life for developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, without ambitions for so-called happiness."

Because of his developed consciousness, however, the human being must understand the constitutional position of the living entity and understand why he must accept a material body. This chance is given to him by nature, but if he nonetheless acts like an animal, what is the benefit of his human life? In this life one must select the goal of life and act accordingly. Having received instructions from the spiritual master and the \u015b\u0101stra, one must be sufficiently intelligent. In the human form of life, one should not remain foolish and ignorant, but must inquire about his constitutional position. This is called ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101. The human psychology gives rise to many questions, which various philosophers have considered and answered with various types of philosophy based upon mental concoction.

Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201d (Bg. 4.34) One must approach a bona fide spiritual master by surrendering himself (pra\u1e47ip\u0101tena) and rendering service. An intelligent person must inquire from the spiritual master about the goal of life. A bona fide spiritual master can answer all such questions because he has seen the real truth. Even in ordinary activities, we first consider gain and loss, and then we act. Similarly, an intelligent person must consider the entire process of material existence and then act intelligently, following the directions of the bona fide spiritual master."

Other processes may be helpful, but if one does not develop his love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, these other processes are simply a waste of time. \u201cDuties [dharma] executed by men, regardless of occupation, are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Supreme Lord.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.8) The test of perfection is one\u2019s unalloyed devotion to the Lord."

The highly elevated devotee never sees anything unrelated to Govinda. \u201cThe mah\u0101-bh\u0101gavata, the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything mobile and immobile, but he does not exactly see their forms. Rather, everywhere he immediately sees manifest the form of the Supreme Lord.\u201d (Cc. Madhya 8.274) Even in this material world, a devotee does not see materially manifested things; instead he sees Govinda in everything. When he sees a tree or a human being, a devotee sees them in relation to Govinda. Govindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63am: Govinda is the original source of everything. \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.1) The test of a perfect devotee is that he sees Govinda everywhere in this universe, even in every atomic particle (a\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101ntara-stha-param\u0101\u1e47u-cay\u0101ntara-stham). This is the perfect vision of a devotee. It is therefore said: A devotee sees everyone and everything in relationship with N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-mayam). Everything is an expansion of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s energy. Just as those who are greedy see everything as a source of money-making and those who are lusty see everything as being conducive to sex, the most perfect devotee, Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, saw N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a even within a stone column. This does not mean, however, that we must accept the words daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, which have been manufactured by some unscrupulous person. One who actually envisions N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a everywhere makes no distinction between the poor and the rich. To single out the daridra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or poor N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and reject the dhani-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or rich N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, is not the vision of a devotee. Rather, that is the imperfect vision of materialistic persons."
