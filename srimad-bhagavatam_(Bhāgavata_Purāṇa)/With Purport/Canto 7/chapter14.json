        "purport": " In the previous chapters the great sage N\u0101rada has explained how a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, a v\u0101naprastha and a sanny\u0101s\u012b should act. He first explained the dealings of a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101s\u012b because these three \u0101\u015bramas, or statuses of life, are extremely important for fulfillment of the goal of life. One should note that in the brahmac\u0101r\u012b-\u0101\u015brama, v\u0101naprastha-\u0101\u015brama and sanny\u0101sa-\u0101\u015brama there is no scope for sex life, whereas sex is allowed in g\u1e5bhastha life under regulations. N\u0101rada Muni, therefore, first described brahmacarya, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa because he wanted to stress that sex is not at all necessary, although one who absolutely requires it is allowed to enter g\u1e5bhastha life, or household life, which is also regulated by the \u015b\u0101stras and guru. Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira Mah\u0101r\u0101ja could understand all this. Therefore, as a g\u1e5bhastha, he presented himself as g\u1e5bha-m\u016b\u1e0dha-dh\u012b\u1e25, one who is completely ignorant of the goal of life. A person who remains a householder in family life is certainly ignorant of life\u2019s goal; he is not very much advanced in intelligence. As soon as possible, one should give up his so-called comfortable life at home and prepare to undergo austerity, or tapasya. Tapo divya\u1e41 putrak\u0101. According to the instructions given by \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva to His sons, we should not create a so-called comfortable situation, but must prepare to undergo austerity. This is how a human being should actually live to fulfill life\u2019s ultimate goal."

How to satisfy V\u0101sudeva in this life can be perfectly understood through the association of great devotees of the Lord.",
        "purport": " The format for g\u1e5bhastha life should be dedication to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (6.1) it is said: \u201cOne who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no work.\u201d Whether one acts as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha or sanny\u0101s\u012b, he must act only for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva \u2014 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the son of Vasudeva. This should be the principle for everyone\u2019s life. N\u0101rada Muni has already described the principles of life for a brahmac\u0101r\u012b, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101s\u012b, and now he is describing how a g\u1e5bhastha should live. The basic principle is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The science of satisfying the Supreme Lord can be learned as described here: s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d up\u0101s\u012bta mah\u0101-mun\u012bn. The word mah\u0101-mun\u012bn refers to great saintly persons or devotees. Saintly persons are generally known as munis, or thoughtful philosophers concerned with transcendental subject matters, and mah\u0101-mun\u012bn refers to those who have not only thoroughly studied the goal of life but who are actually engaged in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva. These persons are known as devotees. Unless one associates with devotees, one cannot learn the science of v\u0101sudev\u0101rpa\u1e47a, or dedicating one\u2019s life to V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In India the principles of this science were followed strictly. Even fifty years ago, I saw that in the villages of Bengal and the suburbs of Calcutta, people engaged in hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam daily when all their activities ended, or at least in the evening before going to bed. Everyone would hear the Bh\u0101gavatam. Bh\u0101gavata classes were held in every village, and thus people had the advantage of hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which describes everything about the aim of life \u2014 liberation or salvation. This will be clearly explained in the next verses."

Thus one should gradually become detached from affection for his wife and children, exactly like a man awakening from a dream.",
        "purport": " The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement has been established to give g\u1e5bhasthas all over the world an opportunity to hear \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 specifically. The process, as described in many ways, is one of hearing and chanting (\u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana\u1e25). Everyone, especially the g\u1e5bhasthas, who are m\u016b\u1e0dha-dh\u012b, ignorant about the goal of life, should be given opportunities to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Simply by hearing, by attending lectures in the different centers of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, where topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam are discussed, they will be purified of their sinful inclination for constant indulgence in illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling, which have all become prominent in modern days. Thus they can be raised to the status of light. Pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana\u1e25. Simply by joining the k\u012brtana \u2014 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2014 and by hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one must be purified, especially if he also takes pras\u0101da. This is all going on in the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Another specific description here is \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47van bhagavato\u00a0\u2019bh\u012bk\u1e63\u1e47am avat\u0101ra-kath\u0101m\u1e5btam. It is not that because one has once finished Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 he should not hear it again. The word abh\u012bk\u1e63\u1e47am is very important. We should hear again and again. There is no question of stopping: even if one has read these topics many times, he should go on reading again and again because bhagavat-kath\u0101, the words spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotees about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are am\u1e5btam, nectar. The more one drinks this am\u1e5btam, the more he advances in his eternal life. The human form of life is meant for liberation, but unfortunately, due to the influence of Kali-yuga, every day the g\u1e5bhasthas are working hard like asses. Early in the morning they rise and travel even a hundred miles away to earn bread. Especially in the Western countries, I have seen that people awaken at five o\u2019clock to go to offices and factories to earn their livelihood. People in Calcutta and Bombay also do this every day. They work very hard in the office or factory, and again they spend three or four hours in transportation returning home. Then they retire at ten o\u2019clock and again rise early in the morning to go to their offices and factories. This kind of hard labor is described in the \u015b\u0101stras as the life of pigs and stool-eaters. N\u0101ya\u1e41 deho deha-bh\u0101j\u0101\u1e41 n\u1e5bloke ka\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101n k\u0101m\u0101n arhate vi\u1e0d-bhuj\u0101\u1e41 ye: \u201cOf all living entities who have accepted material bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should not work hard day and night simply for sense gratification, which is available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.5.1) One must find some time for hearing \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. This is Vedic culture. One should work eight hours at the most to earn his livelihood, and either in the afternoon or in the evening a householder should associate with devotees to hear about the incarnations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His activities and thus be gradually liberated from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. However, instead of finding time to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the householders, after working hard in offices and factories, find time to go to a restaurant or a club where instead of hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His activities they are very much pleased to hear about the political activities of demons and nondevotees and to enjoy sex, wine, women and meat and in this way waste their time. This is not g\u1e5bhastha life, but demoniac life. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, however, with its centers all over the world, gives such fallen and condemned persons an opportunity to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In a dream we form a society of friendship and love, and when we awaken we see that it has ceased to exist. Similarly, one\u2019s gross society, family and love are also a dream, and this dream will be over as soon as one dies. Therefore, whether one is dreaming in a subtle way or a gross way, these dreams are all false and temporary. One\u2019s real business is to understand that one is soul (aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi) and that his activities should therefore be different. Then one can be happy. \u201cOne who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.\u201d (Bg. 18.54) One who is engaged in devotional service can very easily be liberated from the dream of materialistic life."

        "translation": "While working to earn his livelihood as much as necessary to maintain body and soul together, one who is actually learned should live in human society unattached to family affairs, although externally appearing very much attached.",
        "purport": " This is the picture of ideal family life. When \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu asked R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya about the goal of life, R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya described it in different ways, according to the recommendations of the revealed scriptures, and finally \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nanda R\u0101ya explained that one may stay in his own position, whether as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, a \u015b\u016bdra, a sanny\u0101s\u012b or whatever, but one must try to inquire about life\u2019s goal (ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101). This is the proper utilization of the human form of life. When one misuses the gift of the human form by unnecessarily indulging in the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, mating and defending and does not try to get out of the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, which subjects one to repeated birth, death, old age and disease, one is again punished by being forced to descend to the lower species and undergo evolution according to the laws of nature. Prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 karm\u0101\u1e47i sarva\u015ba\u1e25. Being completely under the grip of material nature, the living entity must evolve again from the lower species to the higher species until he at last returns to human life and gets the chance to be freed from the material clutches. A wise man, however, learns from the \u015b\u0101stras and guru that we living entities are all eternal but are put into troublesome conditions because of associating with different modes under the laws of material nature. He therefore concludes that in the human form of life he should not endeavor for unnecessary necessities, but should live a very simple life, just maintaining body and soul together. Certainly one requires some means of livelihood, and according to one\u2019s var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama this means of livelihood is prescribed in the \u015b\u0101stras. One should be satisfied with this. Therefore, instead of hankering for more and more money, a sincere devotee of the Lord tries to invent some ways to earn his livelihood, and when he does so K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a helps him. Earning one\u2019s livelihood, therefore, is not a problem. The real problem is how to get free from the bondage of birth, death and old age. Attaining this freedom, and not inventing unnecessary necessities, is the basic principle of Vedic civilization. One should be satisfied with whatever means of life comes automatically. The modern materialistic civilization is just the opposite of the ideal civilization. Every day the so-called leaders of modern society invent something contributing to a cumbersome way of life that implicates people more and more in the cycle of birth, death, old age and disease."

        "translation": "The natural products created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be utilized to maintain the bodies and souls of all living entities. The necessities of life are of three types: those produced from the sky [from rainfall], from the earth [from the mines, the seas or the fields], and from the atmosphere [that which is obtained suddenly and unexpectedly].",
        "purport": " We living entities in different forms are all children of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by the Lord in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.4): \u201cIt should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunt\u012b, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.\u201d The Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the father of all living entities in different species and forms. One who is intelligent can see that all living entities in the 8,400,000 bodily forms are part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are His sons. Everything within the material and spiritual worlds is the property of the Supreme Lord (\u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam), and therefore everything has a relationship with Him. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says in this regard: \u201cOne who rejects anything without knowledge of its relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is incomplete in his renunciation.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.256) Although M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers say that the material creation is false, actually it is not false; it is factual, but the idea that everything belongs to human society is false. Everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for everything is created by Him. All living entities, being the Lord\u2019s sons, His eternal parts and parcels, have the right to use their father\u2019s property by nature\u2019s arrangement. As stated in the Upani\u1e63ads, tena tyaktena bhu\u00f1j\u012bth\u0101 m\u0101 g\u1e5bdha\u1e25 kasya svid dhanam. Everyone should be satisfied with the things allotted him by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; no one should encroach upon another\u2019s rights or property. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is said: \u201cAll living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by performance of yaj\u00f1a [sacrifice], and yaj\u00f1a is born of prescribed duties.\u201d (Bg. 3.14) When food grains are sufficiently produced, both animals and human beings can be nourished without difficulty for their maintenance. This is nature\u2019s arrangement. Prak\u1e5bte\u1e25 kriyam\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 karm\u0101\u1e47i sarva\u015ba\u1e25. Everyone is acting under the influence of material nature, and only fools think they can improve upon what God has created. The householders are specifically responsible for seeing that the laws of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are maintained, without fighting between men, communities, societies or nations. Human society should properly utilize the gifts of God, especially the food grains that grow because of rain falling from the sky. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, yaj\u00f1\u0101d bhavati parjanya\u1e25. So that rainfall will be regulated, humanity should perform yaj\u00f1as, sacrifices. Yaj\u00f1as were previously performed with offerings of oblations of ghee and food grains, but in this age, of course, this is no longer possible, for the production of ghee and food grains has diminished because of the sinful life of human society. However, people should take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra, as recommended in the \u015b\u0101stras (yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25). If people throughout the world take to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement and chant the easy sound vibration of the transcendental name and fame of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be no scarcity of rainfall; consequently food grains, fruits and flowers will be properly produced, and all the necessities of life will be easily obtained. G\u1e5bhasthas, or householders, should take the responsibility for organizing such natural production. It is therefore said, tasyaiva heto\u1e25 prayateta kovida\u1e25. An intelligent person should try to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness through the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, and all the necessities of life will automatically follow."

        "purport": " By God\u2019s favor we sometimes get large quantities of food grains or suddenly receive some contribution or unexpected profit in business. In this way we may get more money than needed. So, how should that be spent? There is no need to accumulate money in the bank merely to increase one\u2019s bank balance. Such a mentality is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (16.13) as asuric, demoniac. \u201cThe demoniac person thinks,\u00a0\u2018So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more.\u2019\u201d The asura is concerned with how much wealth he has in the bank today and how it will increase tomorrow, but unrestricted accumulation of wealth is not permitted either by the \u015b\u0101stra or, in the modern age, by the government. Actually, if one has more than one requires for his necessities, the extra money should be spent for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to the Vedic civilization, it should all be given to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, as ordered by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.27): \u201cO son of Kunt\u012b, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.\u201d G\u1e5bhasthas should spend extra money only for the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. The g\u1e5bhasthas should give contributions for constructing temples of the Supreme Lord and for preaching of \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all over the world. \u015a\u1e5b\u1e47van bhagavato \u2019bh\u012bk\u1e63\u1e47am avat\u0101ra-kath\u0101m\u1e5btam. In the \u015b\u0101stras \u2014 the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and other Vedic literatures \u2014 there are so many narrations describing the transcendental activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and everyone should hear them again and again. For example, even if we read the entire Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 every day, all eighteen chapters, in each reading we shall find a new explanation. That is the nature of transcendental literature. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement therefore affords one an opportunity to spend his extra earnings for the benefit of all human society by expanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In India especially we see hundreds and thousands of temples that were constructed by the wealthy men of society who did not want to be called thieves and be punished. This verse is very important. As stated here, one who accumulates more money than needed is a thief, and by the laws of nature he will be punished. One who acquires more money than necessary becomes desirous of enjoying material comforts more and more. Materialists are inventing so many artificial necessities, and those who have money, being allured by such artificial necessities, try to accumulate money to possess more and more. This is the idea of modern economic development. Everyone is engaged in earning money, and the money is kept in the bank, which then offers money to the public. In this cycle of activities, everyone is engaged in getting more and more money, and therefore the ideal goal of human life is being lost. Concisely, it may be said that everyone is a thief and is liable to be punished. Punishment by the laws of nature takes place in the cycle of birth and death. No one dies fully satisfied by the fulfillment of material desires, for that is not possible. Therefore at the time of one\u2019s death one is very sorry, being unable to fulfill his desires. By the laws of nature one is then offered another body to fulfill his unsatisfied desires, and upon taking birth again, accepting another material body, one voluntarily accepts the threefold miseries of life."

        "translation": "One should treat animals such as deer, camels, asses, monkeys, mice, snakes, birds and flies exactly like one\u2019s own son. How little difference there actually is between children and these innocent animals.",
        "purport": " One who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness understands that there is no difference between the animals and the innocent children in one\u2019s home. Even in ordinary life, it is our practical experience that a household dog or cat is regarded on the same level as one\u2019s children, without any envy. Like children, the unintelligent animals are also sons of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, even though a householder, should not discriminate between children and poor animals. Unfortunately, modern society has devised many means for killing animals in different forms of life. For example, in the agricultural fields there may be many mice, flies and other creatures that disturb production, and sometimes they are killed by pesticides. In this verse, however, such killing is forbidden. Every living entity should be nourished by the food given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Human society should not consider itself the only enjoyer of all the properties of God; rather, men should understand that all the other animals also have a claim to God\u2019s property. In this verse even the snake is mentioned, indicating that a householder should not be envious even of a snake. If everyone is fully satisfied by eating food that is a gift from the Lord, why should there be envy between one living being and another? In modern days people are very much inclined toward communistic ideas of society, but we do not think that there can be any better communistic idea than that which is explained in this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Even in the communistic countries the poor animals are killed without consideration, although they also should have the right to take their allotted food with which to live."

Even in householder life, one should be satisfied to maintain body and soul together with whatever is available with minimum endeavor, according to place and time, by the grace of the Lord.

        "purport": " In human life there are four principles to be fulfilled \u2014 dharma, artha, k\u0101ma and mok\u1e63a (religion, economic development, sense gratification, and liberation). First one should be religious, observing various rules and regulations, and then one must earn some money for maintenance of his family and the satisfaction of his senses. The most important ceremony for sense gratification is marriage because sexual intercourse is one of the principal necessities of the material body. Yan maithun\u0101di-g\u1e5bhamedhi-sukha\u1e41 hi tuccham. Although sexual intercourse is not a very exalted requisite in life, both animals and men require some sense gratification because of material propensities. One should be satisfied with married life and not expend energy for extra sense gratification or sex life. As for economic development, the responsibility for this should be entrusted mainly to the vai\u015byas and g\u1e5bhasthas. Human society should be divided into var\u1e47as and \u0101\u015bramas \u2014 br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya, \u015b\u016bdra, brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. Economic development is necessary for g\u1e5bhasthas. Br\u0101hma\u1e47a g\u1e5bhasthas should be satisfied with a life of adhyayana, adhy\u0101pana, yajana and y\u0101jana \u2014 being learned scholars, teaching others to be scholars, learning how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and also teaching others how to worship Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or even the demigods. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a should do this without remuneration, but he is allowed to accept charity from a person whom he teaches how to be a human being. As for the k\u1e63atriyas, they are supposed to be the kings of the land, and the land should be distributed to the vai\u015byas for agricultural activities, cow protection and trade. \u015a\u016bdras must work; sometimes they should engage in occupational duties as cloth manufacturers, weavers, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, brasssmiths, and so on, or else they should engage in hard labor to produce food grains. These are the different occupational duties by which men should earn their livelihood, and in this way human society should be simple. At the present moment, however, everyone is engaged in technological advancement, which is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as ugra-karma \u2014 extremely severe endeavor. This ugra-karma is the cause of agitation within the human mind. Men are engaging in many sinful activities and becoming degraded by opening slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette factories, as well as nightclubs and other establishments for sense enjoyment. In this way they are spoiling their lives. In all of these activities, of course, householders are involved, and therefore it is advised here, with the use of the word api, that even though one is a householder, one should not engage himself in severe hardships. One\u2019s means of livelihood should be extremely simple. As for those who are not g\u1e5bhasthas \u2014 the brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, v\u0101naprasthas and sanny\u0101s\u012bs \u2014 they don\u2019t have to do anything but strive for advancement in spiritual life. This means that three fourths of the entire population should stop sense gratification and simply be engaged in the advancement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Only one fourth of the population should be g\u1e5bhastha, and that should be according to laws of restricted sense gratification. The g\u1e5bhasthas, v\u0101naprasthas, brahmac\u0101r\u012bs and sanny\u0101s\u012bs should endeavor together with their total energy to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. This type of civilization is called daiva-var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama. One of the objectives of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is to establish this daiva-var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama, but not to encourage so-called var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama without scientifically organized endeavor by human society."

        "purport": " Although in modern society the dog is accepted as part of one\u2019s household paraphernalia, in the Vedic system of household life the dog is untouchable; as mentioned here, a dog may be maintained with proper food, but it cannot be allowed to enter one\u2019s house, what to speak of the bedroom. Outcastes or untouchable ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las should also be provided with the necessities for life. The word used in this connection is yath\u0101, which means \u201cas much as deserved.\u201d The outcastes should not be given money with which to indulge in more than they need, for otherwise they will misuse it. At the present moment, for example, low-class men are generally paid quite amply, but instead of using their money to cultivate knowledge and advance in life, such low-class men use their extra money for wine-drinking and similar sinful activities. As mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.13), c\u0101tur-var\u1e47ya\u1e41 may\u0101 s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-karma-vibh\u0101ga\u015ba\u1e25: there must be four divisions of human society according to the work and qualities of men. Men with the lowest qualities cannot do any work that requires higher intelligence. However, although such a division of men must exist according to their quality and work, it is suggested herewith that everyone must have the necessities of life. The communists of the present day are in favor of supplying the necessities of life to everyone, but they consider only the human beings and not the lower animals. The Bh\u0101gavatam\u2019s principles are so broad, however, that it recommends that the necessities of life be supplied to everyone, man or animal, regardless of good or bad qualities. The idea of giving even one\u2019s wife to the service of the public is that one\u2019s intimate relationship with his wife, or one\u2019s excessive attachment for his wife, by which one thinks his wife to be his better half or to be identical with himself, must gradually be given up. As formerly suggested, the idea of ownership, even of one\u2019s family, must be abandoned. The dream of material life is the cause of bondage in the cycle of birth and death, and therefore one should give up this dream. Consequently, in the human form of life one\u2019s attachment for his wife should be given up, as suggested herein."

If one is fortunate enough to possess transcendental knowledge as well as the money with which to perform sacrifices, one must do it according to the directions given in the \u015b\u0101stras. It is said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.3.52): The entire Vedic civilization aims at satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This was possible in Satya-yuga by meditation upon the Supreme Lord within the core of one\u2019s heart and in Tret\u0101-yuga by the performance of costly yaj\u00f1as. The same goal could be achieved in Dv\u0101para-yuga by worship of the Lord in the temple, and in this Age of Kali one can achieve the same goal by performing sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. Therefore one who has education and wealth must use them to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by helping the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement that has already begun \u2014 the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. All educated and wealthy persons must join this movement, since money and education are meant for service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If money and education are not engaged in the service of the Lord, these valuable assets must be engaged in the service of m\u0101y\u0101. The education of so-called scientists, philosophers and poets is now engaged in the service of m\u0101y\u0101, and the wealth of the rich is also engaged in m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s service. The service of m\u0101y\u0101, however, creates a chaotic condition in the world. Therefore the wealthy man and the educated man should sacrifice their knowledge and opulence by dedicating them for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord and joining this sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement (yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25)."

However, although sacrifice may be offered to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He is more pleased when grains and ghee, instead of being offered in the fire, are prepared as pras\u0101da and distributed, first to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and then to others. This system pleases K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a more than anything else. Furthermore, at the present time there is very little chance to offer sacrifices by pouring oblations of food grains and ghee into the fire. Especially in India, there is practically no ghee; for everything that should be done with ghee, people use a certain type of oil preparation. Oil, however, is never recommended for offering in a sacrificial fire. In Kali-yuga, the available quantity of food grains and ghee is gradually diminishing, and people are embarrassed that they cannot produce sufficient ghee and food grains. Under the circumstances, the \u015b\u0101stras enjoin, yaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yair yajanti hi sumedhasa\u1e25: in this age, those who are intellectual offer yaj\u00f1a, or perform sacrifices, through the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement. Everyone should join the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement, offering to the fire of this movement the oblations of his knowledge and riches. In our sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement, or Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement, we offer sumptuous pras\u0101da to the Deity and later distribute the same pras\u0101da to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas and then to the people in general.

This kind of sacrifice \u2014 chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and distribution of pras\u0101da \u2014 is the most perfect and bona fide way of offering sacrifice for the pleasure of Yaj\u00f1a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u."

        "purport": " The word ayana means \u201cpath\u201d or \u201cgoing.\u201d The six months when the sun moves toward the north are called uttar\u0101ya\u1e47a, or the northern path, and the six months when it moves south are called dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101yana, or the southern path. These are mentioned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (8.24-25). The first day when the sun begins to move north and enter the zodiacal sign of Capricorn is called Makara-sa\u1e45kr\u0101nti, and the first day when the sun begins to move south and enter the sign of Cancer is called Karka\u1e6da-sa\u1e45kr\u0101nti. On these two days of the year, one should perform the \u015br\u0101ddha ceremony. Vi\u1e63uva, or Vi\u1e63uva-sa\u1e45kr\u0101nti, means Me\u1e63a-sa\u1e45kr\u0101nti, or the day on which the sun enters the sign Aries. Tul\u0101-sa\u1e45kr\u0101nti is the day on which the sun enters the sign Libra. Both of these days occur only once within a year. The word yoga refers to a certain relationship between the sun and moon as they move in the sky. There are twenty-seven different degrees of yoga, of which the seventeenth is called Vyat\u012bp\u0101ta. On the day when this occurs, one should perform the \u015br\u0101ddha ceremony. A tithi, or lunar day, consists of the distance between the longitude of the sun and that of the moon. Sometimes a tithi is less than twenty-four hours. When it starts after sunrise on a certain day and ends before the sunrise of the following day, the previous tithi and the following tithi both \u201ctouch\u201d the twenty-four-hour day between the sunrises. This is called tryaha-spar\u015ba, or a day touched by some portion of three tithis. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has given quotations from many \u015b\u0101stras stating that the \u015br\u0101ddha ceremony of oblations to the forefathers should not be performed on Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b tithi. When the tithi of the death anniversary falls on the Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b day, the \u015br\u0101ddha ceremony should be held not on Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b but on the next day, or dv\u0101da\u015b\u012b. In the Brahma-vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said: If one performs the \u015br\u0101ddha ceremony of oblations to the forefathers on the Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b tithi, then the performer, the forefathers for whom the \u015br\u0101ddha is observed, and the purohita, or the family priest who encourages the ceremony, all go to hell."

Anything spiritual done there is certainly very effective.",
        "purport": " There are many atheists who oppose the worship of the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the temple. In this verse, however, it is authoritatively stated that any place where the Deity is worshiped is transcendental; it does not belong to the material world. It is also said that the forest is in the mode of goodness, and therefore those who want to cultivate spiritual life are advised to go to the forest (vana\u1e41 gato yad dharim \u0101\u015brayeta). But one should not go to the forest simply to live like a monkey. Monkeys and other ferocious animals also live in the forest, but a person who goes to the forest for spiritual culture must accept the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as shelter (vana\u1e41 gato yad dharim \u0101\u015brayeta). One should not be satisfied simply to go to the forest; one must take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, therefore, since it is impossible to go to the forest for spiritual culture, one is recommended to live in the temple community as a devotee, regularly worship the Deity, follow the regulative principles and thus make the place like Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. The forest may be in goodness, the cities and villages in passion, and the brothels, hotels and restaurants in ignorance, but when one lives in the temple community he lives in Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha. Therefore it is said here, \u015breyas\u0101\u1e41 padam: it is the best, most auspicious place. In many places throughout the world we are constructing communities to give shelter to devotees and worship the Deity in the temple. The Deity cannot be worshiped except by devotees. Temple worshipers who fail to give importance to the devotees are third class. They are kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012bs in the lower stage of spiritual life. As it is said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.2.47): \u201cA person who is very faithfully engaged in the worship of the Deity in the temple but does not know how to behave toward devotees or people in general is called a pr\u0101k\u1e5bta-bhakta, or kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b.\u201d Therefore, in the temple there must be the Deity of the Lord, and the Lord should be worshiped by the devotees. This combination of the devotees and the Deity creates a first-class transcendental place. Aside from this, if a g\u1e5bhastha devotee worships the \u015b\u0101lagr\u0101ma-\u015bil\u0101, or the form of the Deity at home, his home also becomes a very great place. It was therefore customary for members of the three higher classes \u2014 namely the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas and vai\u015byas \u2014 to worship the \u015b\u0101lagr\u0101ma-\u015bil\u0101, or a small Deity of R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or S\u012bt\u0101-R\u0101ma in each and every home. This made everything auspicious. But now they have given up the Deity worship. Men have become modernized and are consequently indulging in all sorts of sinful activities, and therefore they are extremely unhappy. According to Vedic civilization, therefore, the holy places of pilgrimage are considered most sacred, and still there are hundreds and thousands of holy places like Jagann\u0101tha Pur\u012b, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, Hardwar, R\u0101me\u015bvara, Pray\u0101ga and Mathur\u0101. India is the place for worshiping or for cultivating spiritual life. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement invites everyone from all over the world, without discrimination as to caste or creed, to come to its centers and cultivate spiritual life perfectly."

In other words, any place where the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by devotees is most significant. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is giving the population of the entire world a chance to take advantage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness through the ISKCON centers, where one may perform Deity worship and chant the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra and in this way obtain results with effectiveness increased a thousand times. This constitutes the best welfare activity for human society. This was \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu\u2019s mission as it was predicted by Him in the Caitanya-bh\u0101gavata (Antya 4.126): \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu wanted the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a movement, with installed Deities, to spread to every village and town in the world, so that everyone in the world might take advantage of this movement and become all-auspicious in spiritual life.

No one can become successful in fruitive activities or speculative knowledge without being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.

N\u0101rada Muni has already described the de\u015ba (place) and k\u0101la (time). The k\u0101la has been described in verses twenty through twenty-four, beginning with the words ayane vi\u1e63uve kury\u0101d vyat\u012bp\u0101te dina-k\u1e63aye.

It is therefore said: By worshiping or satisfying Acyuta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can satisfy everyone, just as one can water the branches, leaves and flowers of a tree simply by watering its root or as one satisfies all the senses of the body by giving food to the stomach. Therefore, a devotee simply offers everything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead to receive the best results of charity, religious performances, sense gratification and even liberation (dharma, artha, k\u0101ma, mok\u1e63a)."

But \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and the other Vedic literatures do not agree with this foolish conception. There are living entities everywhere, not only one or two but j\u012bva-r\u0101\u015bibhi\u1e25 \u2014 many millions of living entities. Even on the sun there are living entities, although it is a fiery planet. The chief living entity on the sun is called Vivasv\u0101n (ima\u1e41 vivasvate yoga\u1e41 proktav\u0101n aham avyayam). All the different planets are filled with different types of living entities according to different living conditions. To suggest that only this planet is filled with living entities and that others are vacant is foolish. This betrays a lack of real knowledge."

        "translation": "My dear King, when great sages and saintly persons saw mutually disrespectful dealings at the beginning of Tret\u0101-yuga, Deity worship in the temple was introduced with all paraphernalia.",
        "purport": " As it is said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (12.3.52): \u201cWhatever result one obtained in Satya-yuga by meditating on Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, in Tret\u0101-yuga by performing sacrifices and in Dv\u0101para-yuga by serving the Lord\u2019s lotus feet one can also obtain in Kali-yuga simply by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mah\u0101-mantra.\u201d In Satya-yuga, every person was spiritually advanced, and there was no envy between great personalities. Gradually, however, because of material contamination with the advance of the ages, disrespectful dealings appeared even among br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Actually, an advanced Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is to be respected more than Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. As stated in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, \u0101r\u0101dhan\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47or \u0101r\u0101dhana\u1e41 param: of all kinds of worship, worship of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the best. Tasm\u0101t paratara\u1e41 devi tad\u012by\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 samarcanam: and recommended more than worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worship of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. Formerly, all activities were performed in connection with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but after Satya-yuga there were symptoms of disrespectful dealings among Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has said that a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is he who has helped others become Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. An example of one who has converted many others into Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas is N\u0101rada Muni. A powerful Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava who has converted others into Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas is to be worshiped, but because of material contamination, sometimes such an exalted Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is disrespected by other, minor Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. When great saintly persons saw this contamination, they introduced worship of the Deity in the temple. This began in Tret\u0101-yuga and was especially prominent in Dv\u0101para-yuga (dv\u0101pare paricary\u0101y\u0101\u1e41). But in Kali-yuga, worship of the Deity is being neglected. Therefore chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra is more powerful than Deity worship. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu set a practical example in that He did not establish any temples or Deities, but He profusely introduced the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness preachers should give more stress to the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement, especially by distributing transcendental literature more and more. This helps the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement. Whenever there is a possibility to worship the Deity, we may establish many centers, but generally we should give more stress to the distribution of transcendental literature, for this will be more effective in converting people to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is said in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.2.47): \u201cA person who is very faithfully engaged in the worship of the Deity in the temple but does not know how to behave toward devotees or people in general is called a pr\u0101k\u1e5bta-bhakta, or kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012b.\u201d A pr\u0101k\u1e5bta devotee, or neophyte devotee, is still on the material platform. He certainly engages in worshiping the Deity, but he cannot appreciate the activities of a pure devotee. It has actually been seen that even an authorized devotee who is engaged in the service of the Lord by preaching the mission of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is sometimes criticized by neophyte devotees. Such neophytes are described by Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura: sarva-pr\u0101\u1e47i-samm\u0101nan\u0101samarth\u0101n\u0101m avaj\u00f1\u0101 spardh\u0101dimat\u0101\u1e41 tu bhagavat-pratimaiva p\u0101tram ity \u0101ha. For those who cannot properly appreciate the activities of authorized devotees, Deity worship is the only way for spiritual advancement. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Antya 7.11) it is clearly said, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-\u015bakti vin\u0101 nahe t\u0101ra pravartana: without being authorized by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot preach the holy name of the Lord throughout the entire world. Nevertheless, a devotee who does so is criticized by neophyte devotees, kani\u1e63\u1e6dha-adhik\u0101r\u012bs, who are on the lower stages of devotional service. For them, Deity worship is strongly recommended."

Every living entity is an individual person, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the Supreme Person. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a who is well versed in Vedic knowledge and fully conversant with transcendental matters becomes a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore one should worship such a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. A Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is superior to a br\u0101hma\u1e47a because whereas a br\u0101hma\u1e47a knows that he is Brahman, not matter, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava knows that he is not only Brahman but also an eternal servant of the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, worship of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is superior to worship of the Deity in the temple. Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura says, s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d dharitvena samasta-\u015b\u0101strai\u1e25: in all the scriptures the spiritual master, who is the best of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the best of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas, is considered to be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This does not mean, however, that the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava thinks himself God, for this is blasphemous. Although a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is worshiped as being as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such a devotee always remains a faithful servant of the Lord and never tries to enjoy the prestige that might accrue to him from being the Supreme Lord\u2019s representative."

The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, by their preaching, sanctify the three worlds with the dust of their lotus feet, and thus they are worshipable even for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.",

The br\u0101hma\u1e47as preach the cult of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all around the world, and therefore, although they worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord also recognizes them as worshipable. The relationship is reciprocal. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as want to worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and similarly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants to worship the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. In conclusion, therefore, br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas who are engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord must be worshiped by religionists, philosophers and people in general. At the R\u0101jas\u016bya-yaj\u00f1a of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, many hundreds and thousands of br\u0101hma\u1e47as were present, yet K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was selected to be worshiped first. Therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always the Supreme Person, but by His causeless mercy He recognizes the br\u0101hma\u1e47as as dearmost to Him."
