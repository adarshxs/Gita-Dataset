Furthermore, one should not concern oneself with the conclusions of various logicians or philosophers. Of course, those who preach sometimes need to argue with the contentions of opponents, but as much as possible one should avoid an argumentative attitude. In this connection, \u015ar\u012bla Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya says: \u201cThere is no need to take shelter of unnecessary literature or concern oneself with many so-called philosophers and thinkers who are useless for spiritual advancement.

Herein, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam considers the paramaha\u1e41sas among the sanny\u0101s\u012bs. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b impersonalist sanny\u0101s\u012bs cannot attain the paramaha\u1e41sa stage. This is because of their impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth. Brahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate. The Absolute Truth is perceived in three stages, of which bhagav\u0101n, or realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is meant for the paramaha\u1e41sas. Indeed, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam itself is meant for the paramaha\u1e41sas (paramo nirmatsar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 sat\u0101m). Unless one is in the paramaha\u1e41sa stage, he is not eligible to understand the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. For paramaha\u1e41sas, or sanny\u0101s\u012bs in the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava order, preaching is the first duty. To preach, such sanny\u0101s\u012bs may accept the symbols of sanny\u0101sa, such as the da\u1e47\u1e0da and kama\u1e47\u1e0dalu, or sometimes they may not. Generally the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs, being paramaha\u1e41sas, are automatically called b\u0101b\u0101j\u012bs, and they do not carry a kama\u1e47\u1e0dalu or da\u1e47\u1e0da. Such a sanny\u0101s\u012b is free to accept or reject the marks of sanny\u0101sa. His only thought is \u201cWhere is there an opportunity to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness?\u201d Sometimes the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement sends its representative sanny\u0101s\u012bs to foreign countries where the da\u1e47\u1e0da and kama\u1e47\u1e0dalu are not very much appreciated. We send our preachers in ordinary dress to introduce our books and philosophy. Our only concern is to attract people to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

        "purport": " All living entities within this material world are undergoing the cycle of birth and death according to the laws of nature. This struggle of birth and death in different species may be called the evolutionary process, but in the Western world it has been wrongly explained. Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution from animal to man is incomplete because the theory does not present the reverse condition, namely evolution from man to animal. In this verse, however, evolution has been very well explained on the strength of Vedic authority. Human life, which is obtained in the course of the evolutionary process, is a chance for elevation (svarg\u0101pavarga) or for degradation (tira\u015bc\u0101m punar asya ca). If one uses this human form of life properly, he can elevate himself to the higher planetary systems, where material happiness is many thousands of times better than on this planet, or one may cultivate knowledge by which to become free from the evolutionary process and be reinstated in one\u2019s original spiritual life. This is called apavarga, or liberation. Material life is called pavarga because here we are subject to five different states of suffering, represented by the letters pa, pha, ba, bha and ma. Pa means pari\u015brama, very hard labor. Pha means phena, or foam from the mouth. For example, sometimes we see a horse foaming at the mouth with heavy labor. Ba means byarthat\u0101, disappointment. In spite of so much hard labor, at the end we find disappointment. Bha means bhaya, or fear. In material life, one is always in the blazing fire of fear, since no one knows what will happen next. Finally, ma means m\u1e5btyu, or death. When one attempts to nullify these five different statuses of life \u2014 pa, pha, ba, bha and ma \u2014 one achieves apavarga, or liberation from the punishment of material existence. The word tira\u015bc\u0101m refers to degraded life. Human life, of course, provides an opportunity for the best living conditions. As Western people think, from the monkeys come the human beings, who are more comfortably situated. However, if one does not utilize his human life for svarga or apavarga, he falls again to the degraded life of animals like dogs and hogs. Therefore a sane human being must consider whether he will elevate himself to the higher planets, prepare to free himself from the evolutionary process, or travel again through the evolutionary process in higher and lower grades of life. If one works piously one may be elevated to the higher planetary systems or achieve liberation and return home, back to Godhead, but otherwise one may be degraded to a life as a dog, a hog and so on. As explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.25), y\u0101nti deva-vrat\u0101 dev\u0101n. Those interested in being elevated to the higher planetary systems (Devaloka or Svargaloka) must prepare to do so. Similarly, if one wants liberation and wants to return home, back to Godhead, he should prepare himself for that purpose. Our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore the highest movement for the benediction of human society because this movement is teaching people how to go back home, back to Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (13.22) it is clearly stated that different forms of life are obtained by association with the three modes of material nature (k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 gu\u1e47a-sa\u1e45go\u00a0\u2019sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu). According to one\u2019s association with the material qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance in this life, in one\u2019s next life one receives an appropriate body. Modern civilization does not know that because of varied association in material nature, the living entity, although eternal, is placed in different diseased conditions known as the many species of life. Modern civilization is unaware of the laws of nature. \u201cThe bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the performer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.\u201d (Bg. 3.27) Every living entity is under the full control of the stringent laws of material nature, but rascals think themselves independent. Actually, however, they cannot be independent. This is foolishness. A foolish civilization is extremely risky, and therefore the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is trying to make people aware of their fully dependent condition under the stringent laws of nature and is trying to save them from being victimized by strong m\u0101y\u0101, which is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s external energy. Behind the material laws is the supreme controller, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sacar\u0101caram). Therefore if one surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (m\u0101m eva ye prapadyante m\u0101y\u0101m et\u0101\u1e41 taranti te), one may immediately be freed from the control of external nature (sa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate). This should be the aim of life."

        "translation": "In this human form of life, men and women unite for the sensual pleasure of sex, but by actual experience we have observed that none of them are happy. Therefore, seeing the contrary results, I have stopped taking part in materialistic activities.",
        "purport": " As stated by Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, yan maithun\u0101di-g\u1e5bhamedhi-sukha\u1e41 hi tuccham. Man and woman both seek sexual enjoyment, and when they are united by the ritualistic ceremony of marriage, they are happy for some time, but finally there is dissension, and thus there are so many cases of separation and divorce. Although every man and woman is actually eager to enjoy life through sexual unity, the result is disunity and distress. Marriage is recommended to give men and women a concession for restricted sex life, which is also recommended in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dharm\u0101viruddho bh\u016bte\u1e63u k\u0101mo\u00a0\u2019smi: sex life not against the principles of religion is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Every living entity is always eager to enjoy sex life because materialistic life consists of eating, sleeping, sex and fear. In animal life, eating, sleeping, sexual enjoyment and fear cannot be regulated, but for human society the plan is that although men, like animals, must be allowed to eat, sleep, enjoy sex and take protection from fear, they must be regulated. The Vedic plan for eating recommends that one take yaj\u00f1a-\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da, or pras\u0101da, food offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Yaj\u00f1a-\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u015bina\u1e25 santo mucyante sarva-kilbi\u1e63ai\u1e25: \u201cThe devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food that is offered first for sacrifice.\u201d (Bg. 3.13) In material life, one commits sinful activities, especially in eating, and because of sinful activities one is condemned by nature\u2019s laws to accept another body, which is imposed as punishment. Sex and eating are essential, and therefore they are offered to human society under Vedic restrictions so that according to the Vedic injunctions people may eat, sleep, enjoy sex, be protected from fearful life and gradually be elevated and liberated from the punishment of material existence. Thus the Vedic injunctions for marriage offer a concession to human society, the idea being that a man and woman united in a ritualistic marriage ceremony should help one another advance in spiritual life. Unfortunately, especially in this age, men and women unite for unrestricted sexual enjoyment. Thus they are victimized, being obliged to take rebirth in the forms of animals to fulfill their animalistic propensities. The Vedic injunctions therefore warn, n\u0101ya\u1e41 deho deha-bh\u0101j\u0101\u1e41 n\u1e5bloke ka\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101n k\u0101m\u0101n arhate vi\u1e0d-bhuj\u0101\u1e41 ye. One should not enjoy sex life like hogs, and eat everything, even to the limit of stool. A human being should eat pras\u0101da offered to the Deity and should enjoy sex life according to the Vedic injunctions. He should engage himself in the business of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he should save himself from the fearful condition of material existence, and he should sleep only to recover from fatigue due to working hard. The learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a said that since everything is misused by fruitive workers, he had retired from all fruitive activities."

        "translation": "The actual form of life for the living entities is one of spiritual happiness, which is real happiness. This happiness can be achieved only when one stops all materialistic activities. Material sense enjoyment is simply an imagination. Therefore, considering this subject matter, I have ceased from all material activities and am lying down here.",
        "purport": " The difference between the philosophy of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and that of the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas is explained herein. Both the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas know that in materialistic activities there is no happiness. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, therefore, adhering to the slogan brahma satya\u1e41 jagan mithy\u0101, want to refrain from false, materialistic activities. They want to stop all activities and merge in the Supreme Brahman. According to the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava philosophy, however, if one simply ceases from materialistic activity one cannot remain inactive for very long, and therefore everyone should engage himself in spiritual activities, which will solve the problem of suffering in this material world. It is said, therefore, that although the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers strive to refrain from materialistic activities and merge in Brahman, and although they may actually merge in the Brahman existence, for want of activity they fall down again into materialistic activity (\u0101ruhya k\u1e5bcchre\u1e47a para\u1e41 pada\u1e41 tata\u1e25 patanty adha\u1e25). Thus the so-called renouncer, unable to remain in meditation upon Brahman, returns to materialistic activities by opening hospitals and schools and so on. Therefore, simply cultivating knowledge that materialistic activities cannot give one happiness, and that one should consequently cease from such activities, is insufficient. One should cease from materialistic activities and take up spiritual activities. Then the solution to the problem will be achieved. Spiritual activities are activities performed according to the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu\u015b\u012blanam). If one does whatever K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, his activities are not material. For example, when Arjuna fought in response to the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his activities were not material. Fighting for sense gratification is a materialistic activity, but fighting by the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is spiritual. By spiritual activities one becomes eligible to go back home, back to Godhead, and then enjoy blissful life eternally. Here, in the material world, everything is but a mental concoction that will never give us real happiness. The practical solution, therefore, is to cease from materialistic activities and engage in spiritual activities. Yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25). If one works for the sake of pleasing the Supreme Lord \u2014 Yaj\u00f1a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u \u2014 one is in liberated life. If one fails to do so, however, he remains in a life of bondage."

The modern materialistic scientist thinks that life grows from matter, but actually the fact is that matter grows from life. The life, or the spiritual soul, is compared herein to water, from which clumps of matter grow in the form of grass. One who is ignorant of scientific knowledge of the spirit soul does not look inside the body to find happiness in the soul; instead, he goes outside to search for happiness, just as a deer without knowledge of the water beneath the grass goes out to the desert to find water.

        "translation": "The living entity tries to achieve happiness and rid himself of the causes of distress, but because the various bodies of the living entities are under the full control of material nature, all his plans in different bodies, one after another, are ultimately baffled.",
        "purport": " Because the materialist is in gross ignorance of how the laws of material nature act upon him as a result of his fruitive activity, he mistakenly plans to enjoy bodily comfort in the human form of life through so-called economic development, through pious activities for elevation to the higher planetary systems, and in many other ways, but factually he becomes a victim of the reactions of his fruitive activities. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated as the Supersoul within the cores of the hearts of all living entities. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): \u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\u201d The desires and activities of the living being are observed by the Supersoul, who is the upadra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101, the overseer, and who orders material nature to fulfill the various desires of the living being. As clearly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.61): The Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, and as one desires, the Lord gives one various types of bodies, which are like machines. Riding on such a machine, the living entity wanders throughout the universe, under the control of material nature and its modes. Thus the living being is not at all free to act, but is fully under the control of material nature, which is fully under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As soon as a living entity is victimized by material desires to lord it over material nature, he is subjected to the control of material nature, which is supervised by the Supreme Soul. The result is that one again and again makes plans and is baffled, but as foolish as he is he cannot see the cause of his bafflement. This cause is distinctly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: because one has not surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he must work under the control of material nature and its stringent laws (daiv\u012b hy e\u1e63\u0101 gu\u1e47amay\u012b mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101). The only means of becoming free from this entanglement is to surrender to the Supreme Lord. In the human form of life, the living entity must accept this instruction from the Supreme Person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja. \u201cDo not plan to achieve happiness and drive away distress. You will never be successful. Simply surrender unto Me.\u201d Unfortunately, however, the living entity does not accept the Supreme Lord\u2019s clearly stated instructions from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and thus he becomes a perpetual captive of the laws of material nature. Yaj\u00f1\u0101rth\u0101t karma\u1e47o\u00a0\u2019nyatra loko\u00a0\u2019ya\u1e41 karma-bandhana\u1e25: if one does not act for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is known as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or Yaj\u00f1a, he must be entangled in the reactions of fruitive activities. These reactions are called p\u0101pa and pu\u1e47ya \u2014 sinful and pious. By pious activities one is elevated to the higher planetary systems, and by impious activities one is degraded to lower species of life, in which he is punished by the laws of nature. In the lower species of life there is an evolutionary process, and when the term of the living entity\u2019s imprisonment or punishment in the lower species is finished, he is again offered a human form and given a chance to decide for himself which way he should plan. If he again misses the opportunity, he is again put into the cycle of birth and death, going sometimes higher and sometimes lower, turning on the sa\u1e41s\u0101ra-cakra, the wheel of material existence. As a wheel sometimes goes up and sometimes comes down, the stringent laws of material nature make the living entity in material existence sometimes happy and sometimes distressed. How he suffers in the cycle of happiness and distress is described in the next verse."

No one can escape the threefold miseries of materialistic life, namely miseries pertaining to the body and mind, miseries pertaining to the difficulties imposed by society, community, nation and other living entities, and miseries inflicted upon us by natural disturbances from earthquakes, famines, droughts, floods, epidemics, and so on. If one works very hard, suffering the threefold miseries, and then is successful in getting some small benefit, what is the value of this benefit? Besides that, even if a karm\u012b is successful in accumulating some material wealth, he still cannot enjoy it, for he must die in bereavement. I have even seen a dying man begging a medical attendant to increase his life by four years so that he could complete his material plans. Of course, the medical man was unsuccessful in expanding the life of the man, who therefore died in great bereavement. Everyone must die in this way, and after one\u2019s mental condition is taken into account by the laws of material nature, he is given another chance to fulfill his desires in a different body. Material plans for material happiness have no value, but under the spell of the illusory energy we consider them extremely valuable. There were many politicians, social reformers and philosophers who died very miserably, without deriving any practical value from their material plans. Therefore, a sane and sensible man never desires to work hard under the conditions of threefold miseries, only to die in disappointment."

        "purport": " Greedy capitalists accumulate wealth under so many miserable conditions, the result being that because they collect money by questionable means, their minds are always agitated. Thus they are unable to sleep at night, and they have to take pills for mental tranquillity to invite sleep. And sometimes even the pills are a failure. Consequently the result of having accumulated money by so much labor is certainly not happiness, but only distress. What is the value of acquiring a comfortable position if one\u2019s mind is always disturbed? Narottama d\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura has therefore sung: \u201cI am suffering from the poisonous effect of material enjoyment. Thus my heart is always burning and is almost on the verge of failure.\u201d The result of the greedy capitalist\u2019s unnecessary accumulation of wealth is that he must suffer from a blazing fire of anxiety and always be concerned with how to save his money and invest it properly to get more and more. Such a life is certainly not very happy, but because of the spell of the illusory energy, materialistic persons engage in such activities. As far as our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is concerned, we are getting money naturally, by the grace of God, by selling our literature. This literature is not sold for our sense gratification; to spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement we need so many things, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore supplying us the requisite money to advance this mission. The mission of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world, and for this purpose we naturally must have sufficient money. Therefore, according to the advice of \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b Prabhup\u0101da, we should not give up attachment to money that can spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.256): \u201cWhen persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things which are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, this is called incomplete renunciation.\u201d Money that can help in spreading the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is not a part of the material world, and we should not give it up, thinking that it is material. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b advises: \u201cWhen one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is rightly situated above possessiveness.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.255) Money is undoubtedly coming in great quantities, but we should not be attached to this money for sense gratification; every cent should be spent for spreading the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, not for sense gratification. There is danger for a preacher when he receives great quantities of money, for as soon as he spends even a single cent of the collection for his personal sense gratification, he becomes a fallen victim. The preachers of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement should be extremely careful not to misuse the immense quantities of money needed to spread this movement. Let us not make this money the cause of our distress; it should be used for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that will cause our eternal happiness. Money is Lak\u1e63m\u012b, or the goddess of fortune, the companion of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. Lak\u1e63m\u012bj\u012b must always remain with N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and then there need be no fear of degradation."

        "purport": " Here is the difference between Vedic civilization and the modern demoniac civilization. Vedic civilization concerned itself with how to achieve self-realization, and for this purpose one was recommended to have a small income to maintain body and soul together. The society was divided into br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras, and the members of this society would limit their endeavors to meeting their minimum demands. The br\u0101hma\u1e47as, in particular, would have no material desires. Because the k\u1e63atriyas had to rule the people, it was necessary for them to have money and prestige. But the vai\u015byas were satisfied with agricultural produce and milk from the cow, and if by chance there were excess, trade was allowed. The \u015b\u016bdras were also happy, for they would get food and shelter from the three higher classes. In the demoniac civilization of the present day, however, there is no question of br\u0101hma\u1e47as or k\u1e63atriyas; there are only so-called workers and a flourishing mercantile class who have no goal in life. According to Vedic civilization, the ultimate perfection of life is to take sanny\u0101sa, but at the present moment people do not know why sanny\u0101sa is accepted. Because of misunderstanding, they think that one accepts sanny\u0101sa to escape social responsibilities. But one does not accept sanny\u0101sa to escape from responsibility to society. Generally one accepts sanny\u0101sa at the fourth stage of spiritual life. One begins as a brahmac\u0101r\u012b then becomes a g\u1e5bhastha, a v\u0101naprastha and finally a sanny\u0101s\u012b to take advantage of the duration of one\u2019s life by engaging oneself fully in self-realization. Sanny\u0101sa does not mean begging from door to door to accumulate money for sense gratification. However, because in Kali-yuga people are more or less prone to sense gratification, immature sanny\u0101sa is not recommended. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b writes in his Nectar of Instruction(2): \u201cOne\u2019s devotional service is spoiled when he becomes too entangled in the following six activities: (1) eating more than necessary or collecting more funds than required; (2) overendeavoring for mundane things that are very difficult to obtain; (3) talking unnecessarily about mundane subject matters; (4) practicing the scriptural rules and regulations only for the sake of following them and not for the sake of spiritual advancement, or rejecting the rules and regulations of the scriptures and working independently or whimsically; (5) associating with worldly-minded persons who are not interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; and (6) being greedy for mundane achievements.\u201d A sanny\u0101s\u012b should have an institution meant to preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; he need not accumulate money for himself. We recommend that as soon as money accumulates in our K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement, fifty per cent of it should be invested in printing books, and fifty per cent for expenditures, especially in establishing centers all over the world. The managers of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement should be extremely cautious in regard to this point. Otherwise money will be the cause of lamentation, illusion, fear, anger, material attachment, material poverty, and unnecessary hard work. When I was alone in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, I never attempted to construct ma\u1e6dh\u0101s or temples; rather, I was fully satisfied with the small amount of money I could gather by selling Back to Godhead, and thus I would provide for myself and also print the literature. When I went to foreign countries, I lived according to the same principle, but when Europeans and Americans began to give money profusely, I started temples and Deity worship. The same principle should still be followed. Whatever money is collected should be spent for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and not a farthing for sense gratification. This is the Bh\u0101gavata principle."

If one thus realizes that the individual soul is subordinate to the supreme spirit soul, he achieves self-realization. As explained in the Thirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, there are two souls within the body. The body is called k\u1e63etra, and there are two k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1as, or occupants of the body, namely the Supersoul (Param\u0101tm\u0101) and the individual soul. The Supersoul and the individual soul are like two birds sitting on the same tree (the material body). One bird, the individual, forgetful bird, is eating the fruit of the tree, not caring for the instructions of the other bird, which is only a witness to the activities of the first bird, who is his friend. When the forgetful bird comes to understand the supreme friend who is always with him and trying to give him guidance in different bodies, he takes shelter at the lotus feet of that supreme bird.

Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who is such a devotee, always defied the false instructions of his father and the so-called teachers who were appointed to teach him. Instead, he simply followed the instructions of N\u0101rada Muni, his guru, and thus he always remained a stalwart devotee. This is the nature of an intelligent devotee.

Therefore although Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was a g\u1e5bhastha ruling over the demons, he was a paramaha\u1e41sa, the best of human beings, and thus he is our guru.
