I meditate upon Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahm\u0101j\u012b, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth."

        "text": "Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful Bh\u0101gavatam, compiled by the great sage Vy\u0101sadeva [in his maturity], is sufficient in itself for God realization. What is the need of any other scripture? As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of Bh\u0101gavatam, by this culture of knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart."
