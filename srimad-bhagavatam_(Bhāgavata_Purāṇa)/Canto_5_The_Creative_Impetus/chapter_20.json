Beyond Aloka-var\u1e63a is the destination of those who aspire for liberation from the material world. It is beyond the jurisdiction of the material modes of nature, and therefore it is completely pure. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took Arjuna through this place to bring back the sons of the br\u0101hma\u1e47a."
