On M\u0101nasottara Mountain, due east of Mount Sumeru, is a place known as Devadh\u0101n\u012b, possessed by King Indra. Similarly, in the south is a place known as Sa\u1e41yaman\u012b, possessed by Yamar\u0101ja, in the west is a place known as Nimlocan\u012b, possessed by Varu\u1e47a, and in the north is a place named Vibh\u0101var\u012b, possessed by the moon-god. Sunrise, midday, sunset and midnight occur in all those places according to specific times, thus engaging all living entities in their various occupational duties and also making them cease such duties."

People living in countries at points diametrically opposite to where the sun is first seen rising will see the sun setting, and if a straight line were drawn from a point where the sun is at midday, the people in countries at the opposite end of the line would be experiencing midnight. Similarly, if people residing where the sun is setting were to go to countries diametrically opposite, they would not see the sun in the same condition."
