Indeed, they are actually playthings in the hands of attractive women. Victimized by such a conception of life, they become surrounded by children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and thus they are shackled to material bondage. Those who are very much addicted to this conception of life are called demons. Therefore, although you are sons of demons, keep aloof from such persons and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the origin of all the demigods, because the ultimate goal for the devotees of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is liberation from the bondage of material existence."
