He is the expansion of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u known as Lord Ananta or Lord Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. He is always in the transcendental position, but because He is worshiped by Lord \u015aiva, the deity of tamo-gu\u1e47a or darkness, He is sometimes called t\u0101mas\u012b. Lord Ananta is the predominating Deity of the material mode of ignorance as well as the false ego of all conditioned souls. When a conditioned living being thinks, \u201cI am the enjoyer, and this world is meant to be enjoyed by me,\u201d this conception of life is dictated to him by Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a. Thus the mundane conditioned soul thinks himself the Supreme Lord."

When the beautiful princesses of the serpent kings, hoping for the Lord\u2019s auspicious blessing, smear His arms with aguru pulp, sandalwood pulp and ku\u1e45kuma, the touch of His limbs awakens lusty desires within them. Understanding their minds, the Lord looks at the princesses with a merciful smile, and they become bashful, realizing that He knows their desires. Then they smile beautifully and look upon the Lord\u2019s lotus face, which is beautified by reddish eyes rolling slightly from intoxication and delighted by love for His devotees."

Because He is intoxicated, the Lord looks bewildered, and His eyes, appearing like flowers in full bloom, move to and fro. He pleases His personal associates, the heads of the demigods, by the sweet vibrations emanating from His mouth. Dressed in bluish garments and wearing a single earring, He holds a plow on His back with His two beautiful and well-constructed hands. Appearing as white as the heavenly King Indra, He wears a golden belt around His waist and a vaijayant\u012b garland of ever-fresh tulas\u012b blossoms around His neck. Bees intoxicated by the honeylike fragrance of the tulas\u012b flowers hum very sweetly around the garland, which thus becomes more and more beautiful. In this way, the Lord enjoys His very magnanimous pastimes."

N\u0101rada Muni, the son of Lord Brahm\u0101, always glorifies Anantadeva in his father\u2019s assembly.
