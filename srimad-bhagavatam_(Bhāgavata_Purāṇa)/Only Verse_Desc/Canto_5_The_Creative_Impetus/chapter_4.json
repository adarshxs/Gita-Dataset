This son was equal to everyone and very peaceful. He could control His senses and His mind, and, possessing all opulence, He did not hanker for material enjoyment. Endowed with all these attributes, the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi became more powerful day after day. Due to this, the citizens, learned br\u0101hma\u1e47as, demigods and ministers wanted \u1e5a\u1e63abhadeva to be appointed ruler of the earth."

When the father, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja N\u0101bhi, saw all these qualities, he thought his son to be the best of human beings or the supreme being. Therefore he gave Him the name \u1e5a\u1e63abha."

Although He was a perfect personality, the Supreme Lord and controller of all, He nonetheless acted as if He were an ordinary conditioned soul.

In due course of time, the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma had become neglected; therefore through His personal characteristics and behavior, He taught the ignorant public how to perform duties within the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. In this way He regulated the general populace in householder life, enabling them to develop religion and economic well-being and to attain reputations, sons and daughters, material pleasure and finally eternal life.
