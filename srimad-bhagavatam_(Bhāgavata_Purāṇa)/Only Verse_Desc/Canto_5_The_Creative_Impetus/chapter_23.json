There the son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Utt\u0101nap\u0101da, the great devotee Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva, still resides as the life source of all the living entities who live until the end of the creation. Agni, Indra, Praj\u0101pati, Ka\u015byapa and Dharma all assemble there to offer him honor and respectful obeisances. They circumambulate him with their right sides toward him. I have already described the glorious activities of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva [in the Fourth Canto of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam]."

The unsleeping, invisible, most powerful time factor causes these luminaries to revolve around the polestar without cessation."

Similarly, all the planets and all the hundreds and thousands of stars revolve around the polestar, the planet of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhruva, in their respective orbits, some higher and some lower. Fastened by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to the machine of material nature according to the results of their fruitive acts, they are driven around the polestar by the wind and will continue to be so until the end of creation. These planets float in the air within the vast sky, just as clouds with hundreds of tons of water float in the air or as the great \u015byena eagles, due to the results of past activities, fly high in the sky and have no chance of falling to the ground."

On the end of its tail is the planet of Dhruva, on the body of its tail are the planets of the demigods Praj\u0101pati, Agni, Indra and Dharma, and at the base of its tail are the planets of the demigods Dh\u0101t\u0101 and Vidh\u0101t\u0101. Where the hips might be on the \u015bi\u015bum\u0101ra are the seven saintly sages like Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha and A\u1e45gir\u0101. The coiled body of the \u015ai\u015bum\u0101ra-cakra turns toward its right side, on which the fourteen constellations from Abhijit to Punarvasu are located. On its left side are the fourteen stars from Pu\u1e63y\u0101 to Uttar\u0101\u1e63\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101. Thus its body is balanced because its sides are occupied by an equal number of stars. On the back of the \u015bi\u015bum\u0101ra is the group of stars known as Ajav\u012bth\u012b, and on its abdomen is the Ganges that flows in the sky [the Milky Way]."
