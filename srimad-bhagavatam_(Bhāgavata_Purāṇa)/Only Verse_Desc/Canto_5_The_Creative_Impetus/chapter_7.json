When Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja ruled the entire globe, he followed the orders of his father and married Pa\u00f1cajan\u012b, the daughter of Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa."

He performed the sacrifices known as agni-hotra, dar\u015ba, p\u016br\u1e47am\u0101sa, c\u0101turm\u0101sya, pa\u015bu-yaj\u00f1a [wherein a horse is sacrificed] and soma-yaj\u00f1a [wherein a kind of beverage is offered]. Sometimes these sacrifices were performed completely and sometimes partially. In any case, in all the sacrifices the regulations of c\u0101turhotra were strictly followed. In this way Bharata Mah\u0101r\u0101ja worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

In other words, he performed all the yaj\u00f1as for the satisfaction of Lord V\u0101sudeva, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata thought that since the demigods were different parts of V\u0101sudeva\u2019s body, He controls those who are explained in the Vedic mantras. By thinking in this way, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata was freed from all material contamination, such as attachment, lust and greed. When the priests were about to offer the sacrificial ingredients into the fire, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata expertly understood how the offering made to different demigods was simply an offering to the different limbs of the Lord. For instance, Indra is the arm of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and S\u016brya [the sun] is His eye. Thus Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata considered that the oblations offered to different demigods were actually offered unto the different limbs of Lord V\u0101sudeva."

Yog\u012bs meditate upon the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 situated in the heart, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs worship the impersonal Brahman as the Supreme Absolute Truth, and devotees worship V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose transcendental body is described in the \u015b\u0101stras. His body is decorated with the \u015ar\u012bvatsa, the Kaustubha jewel and a flower garland, and His hands hold a conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower.

The hairs of his body stood on end, and all the ecstatic bodily symptoms were manifest. Tears flowed from his eyes, so much so that he could not see anything. Thus he constantly meditated on the reddish lotus feet of the Lord. At that time, his heart, which was like a lake, was filled with the water of ecstatic love. When his mind was immersed in that lake, he even forgot the regulative service to the Lord."
