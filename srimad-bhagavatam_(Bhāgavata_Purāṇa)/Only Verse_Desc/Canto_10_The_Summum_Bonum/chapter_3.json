The constellation Rohi\u1e47\u012b appeared, as did stars like A\u015bvin\u012b. The sun, the moon and the other stars and planets were very peaceful. All directions appeared extremely pleasing, and the beautiful stars twinkled in the cloudless sky. Decorated with towns, villages, mines and pasturing grounds, the earth seemed all-auspicious. The rivers flowed with clear water, and the lakes and vast reservoirs, full of lilies and lotuses, were extraordinarily beautiful. In the trees and green plants, full of flowers and leaves, pleasing to the eyes, birds like cuckoos and swarms of bees began chanting with sweet voices for the sake of the demigods. A pure breeze began to blow, pleasing the sense of touch and bearing the aroma of flowers, and when the br\u0101hma\u1e47as engaging in ritualistic ceremonies ignited their fires according to Vedic principles, the fires burned steadily, undisturbed by the breeze. Thus when the birthless Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was about to appear, the saints and br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who had always been disturbed by demons like Ka\u1e41sa and his men, felt peace within the core of their hearts, and kettledrums simultaneously vibrated from the upper planetary system."
