He thought, \u201cIt is quite amazing that in a single body Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a simultaneously married sixteen thousand women, each in a separate palace.\u201d Thus the sage of the demigods eagerly went to Dv\u0101rak\u0101. The city was filled with the sounds of birds and bees flying about the parks and pleasure gardens, while its lakes, crowded with blooming ind\u012bvara, ambhoja, kahl\u0101ra, kumuda and utpala lotuses, resounded with the calls of swans and cranes. Dv\u0101rak\u0101 boasted nine hundred thousand royal palaces, all constructed with crystal and silver and splendorously decorated with huge emeralds. Inside these palaces, the furnishings were bedecked with gold and jewels. Traffic moved along a well-laid-out system of boulevards, roads, intersections and marketplaces, and many assembly houses and temples of demigods graced the charming city. The roads, courtyards, commercial streets and residential patios were all sprinkled with water and shaded from the sun\u2019s heat by banners waving from flagpoles."

N\u0101rada Muni entered one of these immense palaces."

In that palace Tva\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 had arranged canopies with hanging strands of pearls; there were also seats and beds fashioned of ivory and precious jewels. In attendance were many well-dressed maidservants bearing lockets on their necks, and also armor-clad guards with turbans, fine uniforms and jeweled earrings. The glow of numerous jewel-studded lamps dispelled all darkness in the palace. My dear King, on the ornate ridges of the roof danced loudly crying peacocks, who saw the fragrant aguru incense escaping through the holes of the latticed windows and mistook it for a cloud."
