In this way K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a very easily spread His glories, which are sung throughout the world by the most sublime and essential Vedic verses. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered that simply by hearing and chanting those glories, conditioned souls born in the future would cross beyond the darkness of ignorance.
