Others were those who had been freed of the reactions to fruitive activities by transcendental knowledge awakened by practice of yoga. And still others were those who had attained residence in Brahmaloka not by ordinary karma but by advanced Vedic knowledge. After devotedly worshiping the upraised lotus feet of the Supreme Lord with oblations of water, Lord Brahm\u0101, who was born of the lotus emanating from Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s navel, offered prayers to the Lord."
