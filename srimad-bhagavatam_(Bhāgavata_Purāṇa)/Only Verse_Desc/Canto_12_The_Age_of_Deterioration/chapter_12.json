It is he who defeats all inauspicious things within this universe. Although in the beginning he was absorbed in the happiness of Brahman realization and was living in a secluded place, giving up all other types of consciousness, he became attracted by the pleasing, most melodious pastimes of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He therefore mercifully spoke this supreme Pur\u0101\u1e47a, \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, which is the bright light of the Absolute Truth and which describes the activities of the Lord."
