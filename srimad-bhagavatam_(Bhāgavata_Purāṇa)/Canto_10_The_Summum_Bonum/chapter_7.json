Simply by one\u2019s hearing of these activities, the dirty things in one\u2019s mind immediately vanish. Generally we are reluctant to hear about the activities of the Lord, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s childhood activities are so attractive that they are automatically pleasing to the mind and ear. Thus one\u2019s attachment for hearing about material things, which is the root cause of material existence, vanishes, and one gradually develops devotional service to the Supreme Lord, attachment for Him, and friendship with devotees who give us the contribution of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If you think it fit, kindly speak about those activities of the Lord."

In such a ceremony, called utth\u0101na, which is performed when a child is due to leave the house for the first time, the child is properly bathed.

On that day, there was a conjunction of the moon with the constellation Rohi\u1e47\u012b.
