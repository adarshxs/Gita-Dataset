The vata is the upholder of both, structure and function of the body. It is the very self of the five forms of vata in the body viz. Prana, Udana, Samana, Vyana and Apana. It is the impeller of upward and downward movements, the controller and conductor of the mind; The inspiritor of all the senses, the conveyer of all the sense-stimuli, the marshaller of the body-elements, the synthesizing principle in the body, the impeller of speech, the cause of feeling and audition, the source of the auditory and tactile senses, the origin of all excitement and animation, the stimulator of the gastric fire, the desiccator of the morbid humors, the eliminator of excrement and deobstruent of the gross and subtle body channels, the modeller of the fetal form, the sustaming principle of life\u2014all these, are the functions of the normal vata in the body."
