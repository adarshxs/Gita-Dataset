The cause of congenital piles is the vitiation of the embryonic cell forming the anal folds. There are two factors which go to vitiate the embryonic cells. Firstly, there are the indiscretions in diet and action of the mother and father; and secondly, the evil action done by oneself in the past births. This rule holds good in all other congenital diseases. \u2018Congenital\u2019 means those disorders that come with birth. \u2018Piles\u2019 means disorder characterized by growth of flesh."
