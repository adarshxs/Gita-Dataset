Keep this apart. Now put together the several herbs coming under the five heads of decoctives namely, life-promoters, roborants, galactagogues, the seminiferous and rejuvenators described in the chapter entitled \u2018The six hundred purgatives\u2019 (chapter IV of Sutra Sth\u0101na) and the pith of sandal-wood, crane tree, oojein, acacia, catechu, blackwood, sissoo tree, Asana, as algo chebulic myrobalans, beleric myrobalans, long pepper, sweet flag, piper chaba, white-flowered leadwort and embelia. Cut all these up into bits and taking 256 tolas of them, cook in 2560 tolas of water till the decoction boils down to one tenth the quantity of water i.e. 256 tolas. Straining the decoction, put in it the powder of the emblic myrobalans spoken of at the outset and cook over a fire of dry cow-dung cakes or of bamboo splinters or the reeds of penreed grass, or of Tejana weeds, till all the water has evaporated, taking care to see that the stuff does not get burnt. Then spreading it on iron pans dry it. After it is thoroughly dried, grind it into a soft powder in a stonemortar placed above the skin of a black deer. Then store it carefully in an iron vessel. This powder mixed with one eighth its quantity of iron-powder, should be given with honey aud ghee according to the patient\u2019s capacity of digestion."

Thereafter, at the end of the year let him on a full-moon day of either Pausha, Magha or Phalguna month, having fasted for the three preceding days, enter a grove of emblic myrobalans. Getting up on a big tree with a plentiful crop of fruits on its stem, let him, holding in his hand a bunch of fruits, keep meditating on Brahman till ambrosia descends into the fruits. For, of a certainty, ambrosia dwells in the fruits of emblic myrobalans at such a moment and they become, by the presence of ambrosia, sweet to the taste like sugar or honey, unctuous and soft. As many fruits as he eats, so many millenniums does he live, with youth restored. Eating to his fill of such fruits, he becomes like unto the gods in splendour, and of their own accord the goddesses of Good fortune, Knowledge and of Speech will wait upon him in person.

When the various decoctions curative of Vata, Pitta and Kapha are made to impregnate the mineral pitch either all at once or one by one, its potency is -increased. The method of impregnating mineral pitch is to immerse it in lukewarm decoction of the specified drugs and to remove it and re-immerse it in the decoction which has again been rendered lukewarm. This process should be repeated for a period of seven days. Such mineral pitch when taken in milk, together with the powder of metals prepared according to the formula given earlier, will ensure long life crowned with happiness.

That variety of this stuff which is sweet and slightly bitter in taste, resembles the china rose in color, is pungent in post-digestive effect and cold, is the exudation from gold ore. The exudation from silver-ore is pungent in taste, white in hue, cold and sweet in post-digestive effect The exudation from copper ore is of the hue of the peacock\u2019s throat, bitter in taste, hot and pungent in post-digestive effect. That exudation which is of the hue of gum guggul, bitter and slightly saltish in taste, pungent in post-digestive effect and cold, is from the iron ore. It is the best of all. All varieties of mineral pitch have the smell of cow\u2019s urine and are suitable for use in all kinds of therapeutic measures, however, the last variety, the exudate of iron ore, is the one most esteemed in vitalizing procedures.
