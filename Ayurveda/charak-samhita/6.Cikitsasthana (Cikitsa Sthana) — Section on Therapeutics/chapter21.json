When the vital regions are affected, the Vata, which has become very strong, causes excessive disintegration of the tissues and leads to dullness of mental processes and produces hiccup, dyspnea and loss of sleep. The patient who has thus lost his sleep, whose mental processes are dulled and whose mind is afflicted, does not find relief anywhere. He is overcome with apathy, and desires to go to bed leaving his seat or standing position. Thus exceedingly exhausted he soon falls into a coma.
