In persons broken down by constant labour, loadlifting and way-faring, and those weakened by constant fasting, sexual indulgence, study, exercise and thinking, owing to their ununctuous condition there will be Vata-provocation, hemorrhage, or ulceration; in cases of gravida, there may be [? complications?] of pregnancy, abortion of the immature fetus and the incidence of severe diseases. In the case of delicate persons, consequent upon the strain on the stomach, there may be excessive hemorrhage through the upper or lower channels. In the case of persons whose alimentary tract is contracted or who do not easily react to emetics, the flux of morbid matter roused but not eliminated, accumulates in the alimentary tract aud causes internally acute spreading affections, stasis, dullness, fainting or even death. In patients with hemothermia affecting the upper region.it may provoke the Udana Vata and take away the life or cause profuse bleeding. In the case of persons afflicted with incessant vomiting, similar are the effects. In condition of upward movement of Vata and in persons who have taken corrective or unctuous enema, there will be augmentation of the upward movement of Vata. In persons suffering from cardiac disorders there will be impairment of the Cardiac function. In cases of misperistalsis, there will be aggravation of the condition which may quickly cause death. Persons afflicted with the lesions in the urinary tract and similar other conditions, there will be manifestation of more acute pain. laypersons suffering from fainting there will be great aggravation. In cases of aches in the head etc, there will be great intensification of pain. Therefore, emesis is contra-indicated in such persons."

In presons of ulcerated rectum there will be very distressing pain in the lesions of the rectum which may cause danger to life, and in case of prolapse of rectum, it may cause death owing to over-action of the bowels. In case of hemothermia affecting the lower region similar result will be produced. The persons who have undergone lightening therapy, those whose senses have become debilitated or whose digestive fire is dull or those who have taken evacuative enema, will not be able to tolerate the action of medication. In case of persons whose minds are agitated by sexual passion and similar other sentiments, either there will be no effect of purgation or there will be some effect of purgation with great difficulty. In these cases there will be harmful effects of the imperfect action of purgation. In cases of indigestion there will be disorders of chyme. In case of persons with recent fever, purgation will not be able to eliminate the toxic matter which is yet immature but will rather provoke the Vata. In case of emaciation due to alcoholism in one addicted to alcohol, the provoked Vata may endanger life. In a condition of meteorism, the Vata getting accumulated in the colon and increasing the distension, begins to spread and causes tympanitis of a severe and sudden type or may cause even death. The Vata lodged in the wounds or ulcers caused by a foreign body or by trauma, may destroy the life. In persons who have taken excess of oleation therapy, there is the likelihood of over-action of the purgative medication. In case of a dehydrated or un-unctuous person, it will cause spasticity of the limbs. In the case of a hard-bowelled person, the morbid matter, being roused up but not fully eliminated, causes cardiac pain, joint-pain, constipation, bodyache, vomiting, fainting and prostration and may even cause death. In persons suffering from the group of disorders beginning with pectoral lesions aud ending with the conditions of gravida, there will be the same evil effects as described in emesis.

In provoked condition of the humors in the stomach and in weakness of the gastric fire, there will be severe anorexia. In a condition of exhaustion due to riding, the enema, causing agitation of the system, brings about emaciation of the body. In conditions of great debility, hunger, thirst and fatigue, the same disorders occur as described before. In a condition of extreme emaciation, the condition will be further aggravated. In the case of enema taken immediately after food or a potion of water, the Vata, getting provoked throws put the enema-fluid upwards or downwards and produces serious disorders. In the case of the enema given following upon emesis or purgation, the evacuative enema would burn the dehydrated body as if cauterized with caustic. In the cage of persons who have taken errhine therapy, it will cause impairment of the senses and obstruction of the channels. In a condition of anger or fright, the enema will mount very high. In a condition of intoxication or fainting due to derangement of consciousness, there will be complications of injury to the mind. In persons who are suffering from incessant vomiting, ptyalism, dyspnea, cough and hiccup, the Vata turned into an upward course, will carry the enema fluid upwards. In persons afflicted with obstruction or perforation of intestines, ascites, or meteorism, the enemata, still increasing the distension, may kill the patient. In conditions of intestinal torpor, acute intestinal irritation, abortion and diarrhea, there will occur disorders of chyme.

In persons who have recently suffered from fever or who are afflicted with grief, the heat, spreading in the vessels in the eyes, will cause cataract and rise of body-temperature; in persons just purged, the Vata, getting provoked, will injure the sense organs.
