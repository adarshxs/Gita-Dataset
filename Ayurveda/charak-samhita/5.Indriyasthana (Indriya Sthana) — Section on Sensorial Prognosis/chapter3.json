If the two sides of the neck, on being felt, are observed not to pulsate, it is to be concluded that he is nigh unto death. If the patient\u2019s teeth are coated all over with tartar, are abnormally white or covered with sugar-like particles, it is to be concluded that he is nigh unto death. If the patient\u2019s eye-lashes are clotted, it is to be known that he is nigh unto death. If the patient\u2019s eyes are not normal but evince abnormal tendencies that is to say if they are too protuberant, too sunken, too oblique, too asymmetrical, too watery, either perpetually open, perpetually closed, or excessively winking, restlessly wandering, with abnormal visions, with deficient vision, have lost their keenness of vision or are wanting in perspective, are color-blind, either too white or too black, or are red like hot embers, or if the vision is suffused over-much with an unhealthy tinge of any one of the colors\u2014black, yellow, blue, dark-brown, coppery, green, turmeric, yellow and white, then it should be concluded that the patient is at death\u2019s door. Thereafter, let the physician take hold of a few hairs of the head or of the body and tug at them. If being thus pulled, they come out with the roots without causing pain, then it is to be known that the patient is soon to depart from life. If the veins in the abdominal region become conspicuous or if they appear dark brown, coppery, blue, yellow or whitish, it is to be understood that the patient is not going to survive. If the nails are drained of blood, and the flesh has receded from them and they look dark blue resembling the color of ripe fruits of the jambul tree, it is to be gathered that the patient\u2019s days are numbered. Lastly, the physician should test the fingers of the patient. If, when jerked, they do not crack, it should be known that it is all over with the patient."
