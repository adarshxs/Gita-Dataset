During the sixth month ghee extracted directly from milk and prepared with the drags of the sweet group should be taken. The same is to be continued during the seventh month. Women say that during that month, the mother suffers burning sensation inside as the fetus develops the hair then. But the worshipful Atreya says, \u2018It is not so. But owing to the fetus pushing forward, the Vata, Pitta and Kapha reach the stomach-region, and cause the burning sensation. When there is cracking of the skin owing to itching, the woman should be made regularly to drink one tola of butter, prepared with the drugs of the sweet group in conjunction with the decoction of jujube. Her breast and stomach regions must be painted with the paste of sandal and lotus stalk or with the powder of siris, fulsee flower, rape-seed and liquorice, or with the paste of the seeds of kurchi aud shrubby basil, nut-grass and turmeric or with the paste of neem, jujube, holy basil and Indian madder, or with the paste of the three myrobalans in the blood of hog, deer, red deer and hare. She should be anointed with oil medicated with the juice of the leaves of oleander. The bath should consist of water treated with Arabian jasmine and liquorice. When she feels itchy she should not scratch for fear of lacerating the skin or disfiguring it. If the urge of itching is intolerable, it may be quieted by means of kneading and friction, massage. She should live on a meagre diet consisting of sweet and carminative articles and containing a little unctuous substance and salt, followed by small draughts, of water.
