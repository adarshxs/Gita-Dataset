Similar to the office of God in the world is the might of the individual soul in man. God\u2019s greatness in the universe is seen as creator; in the body the soul\u2019s greatness is seen as the mind. What Indra is in the universe the ego is in man: the Sun corresponds to the power of seizing, Rudra to anger, the Moon to beneficence, the Vasus to pleasures, the two Ashvins to lustre, the Maruts (winds) to enthusiasm, the Vishvedevas (a group Gods) to the sense-organs and the sense-objects, darkness to delusion, light to knowledge; just as there is the act of creation in the universe, so also in man there is fertilization or the act of impregnation. Corresponding to Kritayuga the first age, is the period of childhood; corresponding to Treta the second age, is youth; corresponding to Dvapara the third age, is old age; corresponding to Kali the fourth and the last age, is infirmity and corresponding to the end of a word-cycle is death in man.

The source of the world and of all affliction is action, while quietus conies from inaction. True understanding is that which arises from the judgement that action is pain and inaction is happiness. The causation of this understanding is the knowledge of the similarity of all living things in the world. This indeed is the utility of this teaching of similarity."

Whatever action\u2014mental, vocal or bodily, which is not conducive to final emancipation, is called attachment; questioning such facts as the results of action, liberation and human survival after death is called \u2018doubt\u2019. The notion, \u2018I am a unitary personality through all vissicitudes, I am the creator, I am perfect by nature I am the unique conglomeration of the body, the senses, intelligence and recollection\u2019\u2014this is vainglory \u2018The mother, father, brother, wife, child, kinsman, friend, servant etc, are mine and I am theirs\u2019\u2014this is wrong identification. Erroneous conception of what is enjoined and prohibited, the beneficial and the harmful, and the good and the evil, is wrong judgement. The confounding of the knower with the non-knower, the original with its modifications, and action with inaction, is absence of discrimination. And lastly, the wrong means are said to be such undertakings as the ceremonial sprinkling of water etc., in sacrifices, fasting, the keeping of the sacred fire, the three diurnal baths, ceremonial spraying, invocation, officiating at another\u2019s sacrifice, sacrificing for oneself, mendicancy and entering the waters or fire etc."

The seeker after final emancipation, who has seen the vanity of the world, should first make his approach to a teacher whose teaching he should then put into practice. Thus, he should tend the ceremonial fire, study the sacred law-books, understand their meaning and taking them for his guide should mould his conduct thereby. He should seek the good and avoid the evil; he should eschew the companion of the wicked; he should speak only that which is true, conducive, to the good of all creatures, gentle, season-able and well-considered. He should regard all creatures as himself. He should avoid all reminiscence, desire, entreaty and discourse with women aud renounce all possessions retaining only the following appurtenance: a loincloth for cover and an ochre colored garment, and for mending it a case of sewing needles. For the sake of cleanliness, he may carry a water-pot and as a mark of his order a mendicant\u2019s staff and a bowl for collecting alms. He may substitute alms by such natural food as is easily available in the woods and just enough to maintain life. If he is fatigued, he may take his rest on a bed improvised with dry fallen leaves and weeds, but he should not do this habitually. He may keen an arm-rest as an aid in meditation. He should dwell in the woods and have no roof over his head, avoiding drowsiness, sleep laziness etc He should check desire and aversion to sense-objects. He should exercise circumspection in sleeping, staying, moving, seeing, eating, recreation and in fact in the movement of every individual limb. He should be indulgent alike to honorable treatment, adulation, contempt and humiliation, and should be able to put up with hunger, thirst, fatigue, strain, cold, heat, wind, fain, pleasure and pain. He should be unmoved by grief, depression, self-conceit, affliction, arrogance, greed, attachment, envy, fear, anger etc. He should look on egoism etc., as causative of suffering, and on the macrocosm and microcosm in the matter of creation etc., as being identical. He should [dread?] procrastination and should never feel disinclined to practise yoga. He should be of an enthusiastic frame of mind. He should bend all his powers of understanding, resolution and recollection towards final emancipation; he should restrain the senses by means of the mind, and the mind by means of the Spirit and the Spirit by itself. He should constantly revolve in mind the categories giving rise to the body and its members and should resolve that every thing that has causation is not the self, is fraught with pain and is transient. He should regard all activity as tainted with evil, and hold the conviction that in the renunciation of all things is true happiness. This is the path leading to final emancipation; straying from this, one is bound. Thus have we described the upward leading steps."
