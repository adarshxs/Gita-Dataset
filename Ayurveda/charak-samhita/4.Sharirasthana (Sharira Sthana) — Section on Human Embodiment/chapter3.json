If, then, it is said that, in as much as man is sprung of man, he emerges with a man\u2019s form, as for instance, an ox is the offspring of au ox, or as a horse is the offspring of a horse; if this is the position, then what has been said before viz, that man is of the nature of a conglomeration, becomes untenable. If, moreover, man is the offspring of man, then why are those, sprung of the idiotic, the blind, the- hunchbacked, the mute, the dwarfish; the lisping, the deformed, the insane, and those suffering from dermatosis or leprous lesions unlike the parents? If, in order to explain away this difficulty, the assumption is that the spirit perceives forms by its own vision, sounds by its own audition, odors by its own sense of smell, tastes by its own sense of taste, the tangible objects by its own sense of feeling and ideas by its own understanding and on account of this, the offspring of the idiotic etc., are not like their parents. Even so, you are open to the charge of going back on your thesis, for, from what you now say it follows that the spirit is aware when the senses are present, and when they are absent it is not aware; and when both conditions obtain, then the spirit is aware in respect of those senses that are present and unaware in respect of those senses that are absent. It follows also that the spirit is mutable, if, then, by means of vision etc., the spirit perceives objects, then in the absence of sense-organs, deprived of vision etc, it is reduced to inertness. Since it is inert, it is no agent; and since it is not an agent, by the same token it is not the spirit.
