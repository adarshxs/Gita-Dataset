Thus, the measure of the aqueous element in the body is ten Anjalis measured with one\u2019s own hands This aqueous element is distributed in various ways; thus firstly it is found in association with fecal matter that is being excessively eliminated as also with urine, blood and other elements of the body; secondly, it is found all over the surface of the body, its seat being the external skin; thirdly, it is found below the skin as in an abscess, when it is given the name of lymph; and fourthly, it is found exuding from the hair-follicles driven by the body-heat, when it takes on the name of \u2018perspiration\u2019; all these kinds of the aqueous element are of the measures of the Anjalis. There are nine Anjalis of the first metabolic product of the inges ed food, which is spoken of as \u2018the body-nutrient fluid.\u2019 There are eight Anjalis of the blood; seven of fecal matter; six of mucus-secretion; five of bile; four of urine; three of flesh-marrow; two of fat; one of bone-marrow; half an Anjali of cerebrospinal fluid; the same measure of seminal fluid and the same measure also of the vital essence.
