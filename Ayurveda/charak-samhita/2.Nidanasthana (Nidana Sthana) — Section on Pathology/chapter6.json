When a man who is weak, engages in a trial of strength with a strong man or exercises with a mighty bow, or talks excessively or carries very heavy weights, or swims very long distances in water or resorts excessively to hard massage or striking with feet, or running over a very long course at full speed or gets injured or carries out any other form of exercise of a similar description either in a faulty or extravagant manner, then by the inordinate character of such activity his chest gets injured. The Vata spreads all over the injured area of the chest. Getting localised there, it gathers the Kapha which is in that region and vitiates the Pitta and then over-runs the whole system, upward, downward and sideways. That part of the morbid Vata which spreads in the body-joints produces in the patient yawning, bodyaches and fever; that part which has penetrated the upper part of the digestive tract, produces cardiac disorders and anorexia; that part which has reached the throat afflicts it and causes weakness of voice; that part which has spread to the channels that conduct the life-breaths (respiratory passage) causes dyspnea and coryza; and that part which has become localized in the head, afflicts the head. Thereafter, in consequence of the injuries to the chest, the abnormal movement of Vata and lesions in the throat, the patient is afflicted with a continuous cough. As a result of the constant coughing, the lungs being injured, the patient expectorates blood; and from the loss of blood thus occasioned, there results increasing debility."

Then, having become thus irritated, it breaks loose, wandering up, down and sideways, driving forward Pitta and Kapha in its course. Thereafter, having distributed itself in the manner described previously, in the entire system, it gives rise to acute pains, either loosens the fecal matter or dries it up, afflicts the sides exceedingly, grinds down the shoulders, causes increased respiratory movement in the threat and chest, afflicts the head and induces cough, dyspnea, fever hoarseness and coryza."

When a man has his heart afflicted excessively with grief and anxiety or is taken possession of by envy longing, fear or anger, or being lean is given to dry eats and drinks, or being of weak constitution abstains from food altogether, or eats sparingly, then under such circumstances, the vital essence abiding in the heart becomes diminished; and from its diminution the patient begins to waste away and if proper counter measures are not taken, develops consumption whose characteristics will hereafter be described."

If even after such seminal depletion, his mind does not turn away from women, then, during the sexual act which he achieves by sheer extravagance of his desire, there is no flow of semen, his body having been totally drained of this vital fluid. Under such circumstances, the Vata forcing its entrance into the arteries of the man who is going through the movements of the sex act, ejaculates blood. Since there is no seminal fluid left in him, the blood, driven along willy-nilly by the Vata, flows out of the seminal ducts."

The victim of such a disorder lives on, however, sustained by the fecal matter. Accordingly, the fecal matter in the body of a man who is wasting away as also of men who are extremely thin and weak, is to be carefully maintained.
