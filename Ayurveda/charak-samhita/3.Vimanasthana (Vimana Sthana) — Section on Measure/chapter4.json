The understanding of the total nature of a thing does not arise from a fragmentary knowledge of it. Out of this group of the three sources of knowledge, theoretical knowledge derived from authoritative instruction [i.e., aptopadesha] comes first; thereafter investigation proceeds by means of observation and inference. In the absence of previous information concerning a thing, how can a man proceed to verify it by means of observation or inference? Therefore investigation is conducted in two ways by those who possess knowledge\u2014direct observation and inference; or in three ways, if instruction is included."
